In this paper we provide a PAC bound that holds for these\nkind of architectures with stable SSM blocks and does not depend on the length\nof the input sequence. Imposing stability of the SSM blocks is a standard\npractice in the literature, and it is known to help performance. Our results\nprovide a theoretical justification for the use of stable SSM blocks as the\nproposed PAC bound decreases as the degree of stability of the SSM blocks\nincreases.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u8a13\u7df4\u5728\u9577\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 S4\u3001S5 \u6216 LRU\uff0c\u662f\u7531\u7d50\u5408\u72c0\u614b\u7a7a\u9593\u6a21\u578b (SSM) \u8207\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5340\u584a\u6240\u7d44\u6210\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b PAC \u754c\u9650\uff0c\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u5177\u6709\u7a69\u5b9a SSM \u5340\u584a\u7684\u9019\u985e\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u8f38\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9577\u5ea6\u3002\u5f37\u5236 SSM \u5340\u584a\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u77e5\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7a69\u5b9a SSM \u5340\u584a\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u4f9d\u64da\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 PAC \u754c\u9650\u6703\u96a8\u8457 SSM \u5340\u584a\u7a69\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "author": "D\u00e1niel R\u00e1cz et.al.", "authors": "D\u00e1niel R\u00e1cz, Mih\u00e1ly Petreczky, B\u00e1lint Dar\u00f3czy", "id": "2405.20278v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20278v1", "repo": "null"}}

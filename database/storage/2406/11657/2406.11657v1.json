It is therefore\nencouraging to see the growing interest in LLM personalization within the\nresearch community. However, current works often rely on the LLM-as-a-Judge\napproach for evaluation without thoroughly examining its validity. In this\npaper, we investigate the reliability of LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge, asking\nLLMs to judge user preferences based on personas. Our findings suggest that\ndirectly applying LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge is less reliable than previously\nassumed, showing low and inconsistent agreement with human ground truth. The\npersonas typically used are often overly simplistic, resulting in low\npredictive power. To address these issues, we introduce verbal uncertainty\nestimation into the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge pipeline, allowing the model to\nexpress low confidence on uncertain judgments. This adjustment leads to much\nhigher agreement (above 80%) on high-certainty samples for binary tasks.\nThrough human evaluation, we find that the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge achieves\ncomparable performance to third-party humans evaluation and even surpasses\nhuman performance on high-certainty samples. Our work indicates that\ncertainty-enhanced LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge offers a promising direction for\ndeveloping more reliable and scalable methods for evaluating LLM\npersonalization.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u78ba\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u50f9\u503c\u89c0\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u57fa\u790e\u5728\u5168\u7403\u64f4\u5c55\uff0c\u9019\u9ede\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u7fa4\u5c0d LLM \u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u611f\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u611f\u5230\u632f\u596e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8457\u4f5c\u5e38\u4f9d\u8cf4 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u8a55\u5224\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u5fb9\u5e95\u6aa2\u8996\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u8ad6\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u4e86 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8a55\u5224\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u6c42 LLM \u6839\u64da\u89d2\u8272\u4f86\u5224\u65b7\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u61c9\u7528 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8a55\u5224\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f4e\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u60c5\u6cc1\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u7b26\u6027\u3002\u901a\u5e38\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5f80\u5f80\u904e\u65bc\u7c21\u5316\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u9810\u6e2c\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8a55\u5224\u8005\u7684\u7ba1\u7dda\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53e3\u982d\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u8b93\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u5c0d\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u7684\u5224\u65b7\u8868\u9054\u4f4e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u6b64\u8abf\u6574\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e8c\u5143\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5c0d\u9ad8\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u76f8\u7b26\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347 (\u8d85\u904e 80%)\u3002\u900f\u904e\u4eba\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8a55\u5224\u8005\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u8207\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u4eba\u985e\u8a55\u4f30\u76f8\u7576\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u9ad8\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u6a23\u672c\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u985e\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u5f37\u7684 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u8a55\u5224\u8005\u70ba\u958b\u767c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30 LLM \u500b\u4eba\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Yijiang River Dong et.al.", "authors": "Yijiang River Dong, Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier", "id": "2406.11657v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11657v1", "repo": "https://github.com/dong-river/personalized-judge"}}

With the\nemergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these\ntools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge. However, the\ntransition from traditional resources like textbooks and web searches raises\nconcerns among educators. They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead\nstudents to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we\nsystematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In\nresponse to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92\nuniversity students to compare three learning sources with different automation\nlevels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key\nconcepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in\nknowledge retention was limited. Additionally, we found that academic\nperformance impacted both learning outcomes and search patterns. Notably,\nhigher-competence learners engaged more deeply with content through\nreading-intensive behaviors rather than relying on search activities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5b78\u7fd2\u662f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u641c\u5c0b\u884c\u70ba\u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u52d5\u6a5f\u3002\u96a8\u8457 LLM \u57fa\u790e\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u8996\u70ba\u7372\u53d6\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f9e\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u548c\u7db2\u8def\u641c\u5c0b\u7b49\u50b3\u7d71\u8cc7\u6e90\u7684\u8f49\u8b8a\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u4ed6\u5011\u64d4\u5fc3\u9019\u4e9b\u5168\u81ea\u52d5 LLM \u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u5b78\u751f\u5c07\u641c\u5c0b\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u6b65\u9a5f\u59d4\u6d3e\u7d66\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u63ed\u9732\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u89c0\u9ede\u7684\u4e09\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u95dc\u6ce8\u9ede\u3002\u91dd\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u95dc\u6ce8\u9ede\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d 92 \u4f4d\u5927\u5b78\u751f\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f03\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7a2e\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u6e90\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM \u5728\u4e0d\u4fc3\u9032\u88ab\u52d5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u652f\u63f4\u5c0d\u95dc\u9375\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u77e5\u8b58\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u5b78\u696d\u8868\u73fe\u5f71\u97ff\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c\u548c\u641c\u5c0b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u8f03\u9ad8\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u900f\u904e\u95b1\u8b80\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u53c3\u8207\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u641c\u5c0b\u6d3b\u52d5\u3002", "author": "Yeonsun Yang et.al.", "authors": "Yeonsun Yang, Ahyeon Shin, Mincheol Kang, Jiheon Kang, Jean Young Song", "id": "2410.01396v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01396v1", "repo": "null"}}

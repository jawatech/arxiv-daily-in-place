Alongside the\nwidely used U-Net architecture, transformer-based models such as the Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) have also gained attention. However, current DiT speech\nmodels treat Mel spectrograms as general images, which overlooks the specific\nacoustic properties of speech. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmethod called Directional Patch Interaction for Text-to-Speech (DPI-TTS), which\nbuilds on DiT and achieves fast training without compromising accuracy.\nNotably, DPI-TTS employs a low-to-high frequency, frame-by-frame progressive\ninference approach that aligns more closely with acoustic properties, enhancing\nthe naturalness of the generated speech. Additionally, we introduce a\nfine-grained style temporal modeling method that further improves speaker style\nsimilarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method increases the\ntraining speed by nearly 2 times and significantly outperforms the baseline\nmodels.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u8a9e\u97f3\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u6b65\u795e\u901f\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 U-Net \u67b6\u69cb\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc Transformer \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\uff0c\u4e5f\u5099\u53d7\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684 DiT \u8a9e\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5c07 Mel \u8b5c\u5716\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u822c\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8a9e\u97f3\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8072\u5b78\u7279\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u6587\u5b57\u8f49\u8a9e\u97f3\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5340\u584a\u4e92\u52d5 (DPI-TTS) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5efa\u7acb\u5728 DiT \u7684\u57fa\u790e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u4e0d\u640d\u5bb3\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u5be6\u73fe\u5feb\u901f\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0cDPI-TTS \u63a1\u7528\u4f4e\u983b\u5230\u9ad8\u983b\u3001\u9010\u5e40\u905e\u9032\u5f0f\u63a8\u8ad6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8072\u5b78\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8a9e\u97f3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u98a8\u683c\u6642\u9593\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u98a8\u683c\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c07\u8a13\u7df4\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd1 2 \u500d\uff0c\u4e26\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u57fa\u7dda\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Xin Qi et.al.", "authors": "Xin Qi, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Tao Wang, Chunyu Qiang, Jianhua Tao, Chenxing Li, Yi Lu, Shuchen Shi, Zhiyong Wang, Xiaopeng Wang, Yuankun Xie, Yukun Liu, Xuefei Liu, Guanjun Li", "id": "2409.11835v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11835v1", "repo": "null"}}

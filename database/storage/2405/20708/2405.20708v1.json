Futurists also pay a lot of effort into figuring out possible\nscenarios for the future. We argue that the exploration of this direction is\nstill in an early stage in the NLP research. To this end, we propose three\nargument generation tasks in the financial application scenario. Our\nexperimental results show these tasks are still big challenges for\nrepresentative generation models. Based on our empirical results, we further\npoint out several unresolved issues and challenges in this research direction.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u601d\u8003\u672a\u4f86\u662f\u4eba\u5011\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6d3b\u52d5\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u672a\u4f86\u5b78\u5bb6\u4e5f\u82b1\u8cbb\u8a31\u591a\u7cbe\u529b\u627e\u51fa\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u60c5\u5883\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9019\u500b\u65b9\u5411\u4ecd\u8655\u65bc\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u8ca1\u52d9\u61c9\u7528\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u500b\u8ad6\u8b49\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u4efb\u52d9\u5c0d\u65bc\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u8a00\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u8b49\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u6307\u51fa\u9019\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4e2d\u5e7e\u500b\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7684\u554f\u984c\u548c\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Chung-Chi Chen et.al.", "authors": "Chung-Chi Chen, Hiroya Takamura, Ichiro Kobayashi, Yusuke Miyao", "id": "2405.20708v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20708v1", "repo": "null"}}

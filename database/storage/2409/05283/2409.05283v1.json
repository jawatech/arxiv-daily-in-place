However,\noptimizing these objectives simultaneously can obscure how improving one aspect\nmight impact the others. In this work, we focus on analyzing the relationship\nbetween two concepts essential in both language model alignment and political\nscience: \\textit{truthfulness} and \\textit{political bias}. We train reward\nmodels on various popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently evaluate their\npolitical bias. Our findings reveal that optimizing reward models for\ntruthfulness on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning political\nbias. We also find that existing open-source reward models (i.e. those trained\non standard human preference datasets) already show a similar bias and that the\nbias is larger for larger models. These results raise important questions about\nboth the datasets used to represent truthfulness and what language models\ncapture about the relationship between truth and politics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u9f4a\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u8a66\u5716\u78ba\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u50c5\u6709\u5e6b\u52a9\u4e14\u7121\u5bb3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u771f\u5be6\u4e14\u516c\u6b63\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u512a\u5316\u9019\u4e9b\u76ee\u6a19\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u6a21\u7cca\u6539\u5584\u4e00\u500b\u65b9\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5206\u6790\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u9f4a\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u5169\u500b\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff1a\\textit{\u771f\u5be6\u6027}\u548c\\textit{\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u898b}\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u734e\u52f5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u96a8\u5f8c\u8a55\u4f30\u5176\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u898b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u512a\u5316\u734e\u52f5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u5de6\u50be\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u898b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u958b\u6e90\u734e\u52f5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5373\u5728\u6a19\u6e96\u4eba\u985e\u504f\u597d\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5df2\u7d93\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u985e\u4f3c\u7684\u504f\u898b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0d\u65bc\u8f03\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u504f\u898b\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u95dc\u65bc\u7528\u65bc\u8868\u793a\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5be6\u8207\u653f\u6cbb\u4e4b\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Suyash Fulay et.al.", "authors": "Suyash Fulay, William Brannon, Shrestha Mohanty, Cassandra Overney, Elinor Poole-Dayan, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara", "id": "2409.05283v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05283v1", "repo": "null"}}

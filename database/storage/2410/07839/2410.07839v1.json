{"2410.07839": {"publish_time": "2024-10-10", "title": "Enhancing Language Model Reasoning via Weighted Reasoning in Self-Consistency", "paper_summary": "While large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved their performance on\na broad number of tasks, they still often fall short on reasoning tasks. As\nLLMs become more integrated in diverse real-world tasks, advancing their\nreasoning capabilities is crucial to their effectiveness in nuanced, complex\nproblems. Wang et al's self-consistency framework reveals that sampling\nmultiple rationales before taking a majority vote reliably improves model\nperformance across various closed-answer reasoning tasks. Standard methods\nbased on this framework aggregate the final decisions of these rationales but\nfail to utilize the detailed step-by-step reasoning paths applied by these\npaths. Our work enhances this approach by incorporating and analyzing both the\nreasoning paths of these rationales in addition to their final decisions before\ntaking a majority vote. These methods not only improve the reliability of\nreasoning paths but also cause more robust performance on complex reasoning\ntasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u8a31\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u8fc5\u901f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7d93\u5e38\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u96a8\u8457 LLM \u66f4\u591a\u5143\u5730\u6574\u5408\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5be6\u969b\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5c0d\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u7d30\u5fae\u8907\u96dc\u554f\u984c\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u6548\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002Wang \u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u67b6\u69cb\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u9032\u884c\u591a\u6578\u6c7a\u6295\u7968\u524d\u5c0d\u591a\u500b\u4f9d\u64da\u53d6\u6a23\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5c01\u9589\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6b64\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u6703\u5f59\u7e3d\u9019\u4e9b\u4f9d\u64da\u7684\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u7121\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u4f9d\u64da\u6240\u61c9\u7528\u7684\u8a73\u7d30\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f91\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u900f\u904e\u5728\u9032\u884c\u591a\u6578\u6c7a\u6295\u7968\u524d\u7d0d\u5165\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9019\u4e9b\u4f9d\u64da\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f91\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f86\u5f37\u5316\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u50c5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f91\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u8b93\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8907\u96dc\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u66f4\u5f37\u5065\u3002", "author": "Tim Knappe et.al.", "authors": "Tim Knappe, Ryan Li, Ayush Chauhan, Kaylee Chhua, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien", "id": "2410.07839v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07839v1", "repo": "null"}}

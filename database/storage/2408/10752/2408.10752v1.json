This research investigates and assesses the security\nof HFL using a novel methodology by focusing on its resilience against\nadversarial attacks inference-time and training-time. Through a series of\nextensive experiments across diverse datasets and attack scenarios, we uncover\nthat HFL demonstrates robustness against untargeted training-time attacks due\nto its hierarchical structure. However, targeted attacks, particularly backdoor\nattacks, exploit this architecture, especially when malicious clients are\npositioned in the overlapping coverage areas of edge servers. Consequently, HFL\nshows a dual nature in its resilience, showcasing its capability to recover\nfrom attacks thanks to its hierarchical aggregation that strengthens its\nsuitability for adversarial training, thereby reinforcing its resistance\nagainst inference-time attacks. These insights underscore the necessity for\nbalanced security strategies in HFL systems, leveraging their inherent\nstrengths while effectively mitigating vulnerabilities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5206\u5c64\u5f0f\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2 (HFL) \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u6703\u56e0\u70ba\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u800c\u7522\u751f\u56b4\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u554f\u984c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u900f\u904e\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc HFL \u5728\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u548c\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u5fa9\u539f\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7a2e\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u8abf\u67e5\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u653b\u64ca\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe HFL \u7531\u65bc\u5176\u5206\u5c64\u7d50\u69cb\u800c\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5c0d\u672a\u9396\u5b9a\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u6703\u5229\u7528\u9019\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7576\u60e1\u610f\u7528\u6236\u4f4d\u65bc\u908a\u7de3\u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u7684\u91cd\u758a\u6db5\u84cb\u5340\u57df\u6642\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cHFL \u5728\u5176\u5fa9\u539f\u529b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u96d9\u91cd\u672c\u8cea\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5f9e\u653b\u64ca\u4e2d\u5fa9\u539f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u8981\u6b78\u529f\u65bc\u5176\u5206\u5c64\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5b83\u5f37\u5316\u4e86\u5176\u5c0d\u6297\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u9069\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u52a0\u5f37\u5176\u5c0d\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u898b\u89e3\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5728 HFL \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u63a1\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u6709\u6548\u6e1b\u8f15\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "author": "D Alqattan et.al.", "authors": "D Alqattan, R Sun, H Liang, G Nicosia, V Snasel, R Ranjan, V Ojha", "id": "2408.10752v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10752v1", "repo": "null"}}

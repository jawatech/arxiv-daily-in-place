{"2412.04060": {"publish_time": "2024-12-05", "title": "Expanding Deep Learning-based Sensing Systems with Multi-Source Knowledge Transfer", "paper_summary": "Expanding the existing sensing systems to provide high-quality deep learning\nmodels for more domains, such as new users or environments, is challenged by\nthe limited labeled data and the data and device heterogeneities. While\nknowledge distillation methods could overcome label scarcity and device\nheterogeneity, they assume the teachers are fully reliable and overlook the\ndata heterogeneity, which prevents the direct adoption of existing models. To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes an efficient knowledge transfer\nframework, HaKT, to expand sensing systems. It first selects multiple\nhigh-quality models from the system at a low cost and then fuses their\nknowledge by assigning sample-wise weights to their predictions. Later, the\nfused knowledge is selectively injected into the customized models for new\ndomains based on the knowledge quality. Extensive experiments on different\ntasks, modalities, and settings show that HaKT outperforms stat-of-the-art\nbaselines by at most 16.5% accuracy and saves up to 39% communication traffic.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u64f4\u5c55\u73fe\u6709\u611f\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u9818\u57df\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u65b0\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u6216\u74b0\u5883\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d7\u5230\u6a19\u7c64\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u8cc7\u6599\u548c\u88dd\u7f6e\u7570\u8cea\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6a19\u7c64\u7a00\u5c11\u6027\u548c\u88dd\u7f6e\u7570\u8cea\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u6559\u5e2b\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e26\u5ffd\u7565\u8cc7\u6599\u7570\u8cea\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u59a8\u7919\u76f4\u63a5\u63a1\u7528\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u50b3\u8f38\u67b6\u69cb HaKT\uff0c\u4ee5\u64f4\u5c55\u611f\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u5f9e\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u9078\u64c7\u591a\u500b\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u900f\u904e\u70ba\u5176\u9810\u6e2c\u6307\u6d3e\u6a23\u672c\u6b0a\u91cd\u4f86\u878d\u5408\u5176\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u7a0d\u5f8c\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u5c07\u878d\u5408\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u9078\u64c7\u6027\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u65b0\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5ba2\u88fd\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52d9\u3001\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0cHaKT \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u9ad8\u51fa 16.5%\uff0c\u4e26\u7bc0\u7701\u4e86\u9ad8\u9054 39% \u7684\u901a\u8a0a\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "author": "Gaole Dai et.al.", "authors": "Gaole Dai, Huatao Xu, Rui Tan, Mo Li", "id": "2412.04060v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04060v1", "repo": "null"}}

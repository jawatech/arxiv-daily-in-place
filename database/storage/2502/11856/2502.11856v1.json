{"2502.11856": {"publish_time": "2025-02-17", "title": "LLMs as a synthesis between symbolic and continuous approaches to language", "paper_summary": "Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between\nsymbolic and continuous approaches to language and cognition. The success of\ndeep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as\nshowing that the continuous camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant\nengineering development. However, in this position paper I argue that deep\nlearning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two\ntraditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both\ncontinuous/distributed and symbolic/discrete-like representations and\ncomputations; 2) models trained on language make use this flexibility. In\nparticular, I review recent research in mechanistic interpretability that\nshowcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a\nnear-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different\nbehaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between\nthe two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of\nthe main reasons for their wild success; and it is also what makes them\nparticularly interesting for the study of language and cognition. Is it time\nfor peace?", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea 20 \u4e16\u7d00\u4e2d\u8449\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0c\u8c61\u5fb5\u8207\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u8a8d\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u9593\u5c55\u958b\u4e86\u4e00\u5834\u6fc0\u70c8\u7684\u6230\u9b25\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f LLM \u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u88ab\u4ea4\u66ff\u8996\u70ba\u9023\u7e8c\u9663\u71df\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u6216\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u767c\u5c55\u800c\u88ab\u5ffd\u8996\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u8a8d\u70ba\u7528\u65bc\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u50b3\u7d71\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u7d9c\u5408\u3002\u9019\u662f\u56e0\u70ba 1) \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\u5141\u8a31\u9023\u7e8c/\u5206\u4f48\u5f0f\u548c\u7b26\u865f/\u96e2\u6563\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8a08\u7b97\uff1b2) \u5728\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u9748\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u6a5f\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f62\u614b\u53e5\u6cd5\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u5be6\u8cea\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4e4e\u96e2\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7de8\u78bc\u5728 LLM \u4e2d\u7684\u3002\u9019\u689d\u7814\u7a76\u7dda\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u4ee5\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u8208\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u64da\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5169\u7a2e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ecb\u65bc\u5169\u8005\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5167\u5bb9\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u9748\u6d3b\u5730\u4ea4\u66ff\u3002\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b83\u5011\u7372\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff1b\u9019\u4e5f\u662f\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u8a8d\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5225\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u6642\u523b\u5230\u4e86\u55ce\uff1f", "author": "Gemma Boleda et.al.", "authors": "Gemma Boleda", "id": "2502.11856v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11856v1", "repo": "null"}}

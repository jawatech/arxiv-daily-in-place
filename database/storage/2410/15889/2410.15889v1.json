The majority of\nattack methods to construct these perturbations suffer from an impractically\nlarge number of queries required to find an adversarial example. In this work,\nwe focus on knowledge distillation as an approach to conduct transfer-based\nblack-box adversarial attacks and propose an iterative training of the\nsurrogate model on an expanding dataset. This work is the first, to our\nknowledge, to provide provable guarantees on the success of knowledge\ndistillation-based attack on classification neural networks: we prove that if\nthe student model has enough learning capabilities, the attack on the teacher\nmodel is guaranteed to be found within the finite number of distillation\niterations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5c0d\u6297\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5728\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7528\u65bc\u5efa\u69cb\u9019\u4e9b\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u5207\u5be6\u969b\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u5373\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\u624d\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u8403\u53d6\u4f5c\u70ba\u57f7\u884c\u57fa\u65bc\u50b3\u8f38\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u64f4\u5145\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c0d\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u53cd\u8986\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u57fa\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u8403\u53d6\u7684\u5206\u985e\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8b49\u660e\u4fdd\u8b49\uff1a\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b78\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5247\u4fdd\u8b49\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8403\u53d6\u53cd\u8986\u904b\u7b97\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u5c0d\u6559\u5e2b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u3002", "author": "Kirill Lukyanov et.al.", "authors": "Kirill Lukyanov, Andrew Perminov, Denis Turdakov, Mikhail Pautov", "id": "2410.15889v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15889v1", "repo": "null"}}

Sifting around\nthese lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient\ninteraction. Several approaches have been proposed to help alleviate this\nprevalent issue either via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few\napproaches have truly been helpful in the past. With the rise of automated\nmethods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of\nidentifying relevant sections in EHR. However, most ML methods rely on labeled\ndata which is difficult to get in healthcare. Large language models (LLMs) on\nthe other hand, have performed impressive feats in natural language processing\n(NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. To that\nend, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that\nGPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well\nas segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we\nalso annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to\nperform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Saranya Krishnamoorthy et.al.", "authors": "Saranya Krishnamoorthy,Ayush Singh,Shabnam Tafreshi", "id": "2404.16294v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16294v1", "repo": "https://github.com/inqbator-evicore/llm_section_identifiers"}}

{"2406.06326": {"publish_time": "2024-06-10", "title": "Self-Tuning: Instructing LLMs to Effectively Acquire New Knowledge through Self-Teaching", "paper_summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to provide up-to-date information\ndue to their one-time training and the constantly evolving nature of the world.\nTo keep LLMs current, existing approaches typically involve continued\npre-training on new documents. However, they frequently face difficulties in\nextracting stored knowledge. Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman\nTechnique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning\nframework aimed at improving an LLM's ability to effectively acquire new\nknowledge from raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a\nSelf-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of\nknowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on\nthree crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection.\nAdditionally, we introduce three Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets to facilitate\nan in-depth analysis of an LLM's knowledge acquisition ability concerning\nmemorization, extraction, and reasoning. Extensive experimental results on\nLlama2 family models reveal that Self-Tuning consistently exhibits superior\nperformance across all knowledge acquisition tasks and excels in preserving\nprevious knowledge.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u96e3\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u65b0\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u800c\u4e16\u754c\u4e0d\u65b7\u5728\u6f14\u8b8a\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8b93 LLM \u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u65b0\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u6301\u7e8c\u5c0d\u65b0\u6587\u4ef6\u9032\u884c\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u7d93\u5e38\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u5132\u5b58\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u6642\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u8cbb\u66fc\u6280\u5de7\u5728\u6709\u6548\u4eba\u985e\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u986f\u8457\u6210\u529f\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u904e\u81ea\u5b78\u63d0\u9ad8 LLM \u5f9e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7372\u53d6\u65b0\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u81ea\u5b78\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8a72\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u81ea\u76e3\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4e00\u7d44\u77e5\u8b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52d9\u4f86\u64f4\u5145\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u95dc\u6ce8\u4e09\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u8a18\u61b6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u7701\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u500b Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA \u6578\u64da\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u65bc\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790 LLM \u5728\u8a18\u61b6\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728 Llama2 \u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u5728\u6240\u6709\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u6301\u7e8c\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u512a\u7570\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u64c5\u9577\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u3002", "author": "Xiaoying Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Xiaoying Zhang, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Jingyan Zhou, Yipeng Zhang, Haitao Mi, Helen Meng", "id": "2406.06326v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06326v1", "repo": "null"}}

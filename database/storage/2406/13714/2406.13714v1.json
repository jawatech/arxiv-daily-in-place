However, often this decision is seen as a\ntrade-off between nutritious choices (e.g., low salt and sugar) or convenience\n(e.g., inexpensive, fast to prepare/obtain, taste better). In this preliminary\nwork, we present a data-driven approach for the novel meal recommendation\nproblem that can explore and balance choices for both considerations while also\nreasoning about a food's constituents and cooking process. Beyond the problem\nformulation, our contributions also include a goodness measure, a recipe\nconversion method from text to the recently introduced multimodal rich recipe\nrepresentation (R3) format, and learning methods using contextual bandits that\nshow promising results.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5011\u5e38\u898f\u4e14\u5b9a\u671f\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u4eba\u6216\u662f\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u6c7a\u5b9a\u65e9\u9910\u3001\u5348\u9910\u548c\u665a\u9910\u8981\u5403\u4ec0\u9ebc\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u958b\u80c3\u83dc\u3001\u4e3b\u83dc\u3001\u914d\u83dc\u3001\u751c\u9ede\u548c\u98f2\u6599\u7b49\u98df\u7269\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u6c7a\u5b9a\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u71df\u990a\u9078\u64c7\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4f4e\u9e7d\u548c\u4f4e\u7cd6\uff09\u6216\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6e96\u5099/\u53d6\u5f97\u3001\u5473\u9053\u8f03\u597d\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6b0a\u8861\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u521d\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u9910\u9ede\u63a8\u85a6\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u9019\u5169\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9078\u64c7\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u98df\u7269\u7684\u6210\u5206\u548c\u70f9\u98ea\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u554f\u984c\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u9084\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u500b\u512a\u826f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f9e\u6587\u5b57\u8f49\u63db\u70ba\u6700\u8fd1\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8c50\u5bcc\u98df\u8b5c\u8868\u793a\u6cd5 (R3) \u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u98df\u8b5c\u8f49\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u5883\u5f37\u76dc\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "author": "Vansh Nagpal et.al.", "authors": "Vansh Nagpal, Siva Likitha Valluru, Kausik Lakkaraju, Biplav Srivastava", "id": "2406.13714v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13714v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2410.01401": {"publish_time": "2024-10-02", "title": "Question-guided Knowledge Graph Re-scoring and Injection for Knowledge Graph Question Answering", "paper_summary": "Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) involves answering natural language\nquestions by leveraging structured information stored in a knowledge graph.\nTypically, KGQA initially retrieve a targeted subgraph from a large-scale\nknowledge graph, which serves as the basis for reasoning models to address\nqueries. However, the retrieved subgraph inevitably brings distraction\ninformation for knowledge utilization, impeding the model's ability to perform\naccurate reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a Question-guided\nKnowledge Graph Re-scoring method (Q-KGR) to eliminate noisy pathways for the\ninput question, thereby focusing specifically on pertinent factual knowledge.\nMoreover, we introduce Knowformer, a parameter-efficient method for injecting\nthe re-scored knowledge graph into large language models to enhance their\nability to perform factual reasoning. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA\nbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8868\u554f\u7b54 (KGQA) \u6d89\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u5132\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u56de\u7b54\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u554f\u984c\u3002\u901a\u5e38\uff0cKGQA \u6700\u521d\u6703\u5f9e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8868\u4e2d\u64f7\u53d6\u76ee\u6a19\u5b50\u5716\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8655\u7406\u67e5\u8a62\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u5b50\u5716\u96e3\u514d\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u96dc\u8a0a\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u963b\u7919\u6a21\u578b\u57f7\u884c\u7cbe\u78ba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u554f\u984c\u5c0e\u5411\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8868\u91cd\u65b0\u8a55\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5 (Q-KGR)\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u8f38\u5165\u554f\u984c\u7684\u96dc\u8a0a\u8def\u5f91\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u4e8b\u5be6\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Knowformer\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u53c3\u6578\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5c07\u91cd\u65b0\u8a55\u5206\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8868\u6ce8\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u5b83\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u4e8b\u5be6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u591a\u500b KGQA \u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002", "author": "Yu Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yu Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, zhao kang, Quanjiang Guo, Min Zhang", "id": "2410.01401v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01401v1", "repo": "https://github.com/EchoDreamer/Q-KGR"}}

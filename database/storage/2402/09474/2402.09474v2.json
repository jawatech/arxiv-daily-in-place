There have been prior studies\napplying AI approaches based on deep learning for heart disease detection.\nHowever, these models are yet to be widely accepted as a reliable aid for\nclinical diagnostics, in part due to the current black-box perception\nsurrounding many AI algorithms. In particular, there is a need to identify the\nkey features of the ECG signal that contribute toward making an accurate\ndiagnosis, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. In the present\nstudy, we develop a vision transformer approach to identify atrial fibrillation\nbased on single-lead ECG data. A residual network (ResNet) approach is also\ndeveloped for comparison with the vision transformer approach. These models are\napplied to the Chapman-Shaoxing dataset to classify atrial fibrillation, as\nwell as another common arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and normal sinus rhythm\nheartbeats. The models enable the identification of the key regions of the\nheartbeat that determine the resulting classification, and highlight the\nimportance of P-waves and T-waves, as well as heartbeat duration and signal\namplitude, in distinguishing normal sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and\nsinus bradycardia.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Aruna Mohan et.al.", "authors": "Aruna Mohan,Danne Elbers,Or Zilbershot,Fatemeh Afghah,David Vorchheimer", "id": "2402.09474v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09474v2", "repo": "null"}}

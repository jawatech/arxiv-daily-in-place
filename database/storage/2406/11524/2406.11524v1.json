The list of informative features is one of\nthe most common output of XAI methods. Multicollinearity is one of the big\nissue that should be considered when XAI generates the explanation in terms of\nthe most informative features in an AI system. No review has been dedicated to\ninvestigate the current approaches to handle such significant issue. In this\npaper, we provide a review of the current state-of-the-art approaches in\nrelation to the XAI in the context of recent advances in dealing with the\nmulticollinearity issue. To do so, we searched in three repositories that are:\nWeb of Science, Scopus and IEEE Xplore to find pertinent published papers.\nAfter excluding irrelevant papers, seven papers were considered in the review.\nIn addition, we discuss the current XAI methods and their limitations in\ndealing with the multicollinearity and suggest future directions.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08XAI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u7406\u89e3\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5167\u90e8\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u9054\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u6c7a\u7b56\u6216\u63a1\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u52d5\u3002\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u6e05\u55ae\u662f XAI \u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u591a\u91cd\u5171\u7dda\u6027\u662f XAI \u5728 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u6839\u64da\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u7522\u751f\u89e3\u91cb\u6642\u61c9\u8003\u616e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u554f\u984c\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u9084\u6c92\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u8a55\u8ad6\u5c08\u9580\u63a2\u8a0e\u8655\u7406\u6b64\u985e\u91cd\u5927\u554f\u984c\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u8207 XAI \u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u6700\u5148\u9032\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8655\u7406\u591a\u91cd\u5171\u7dda\u6027\u554f\u984c\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728 Web of Science\u3001Scopus \u548c IEEE Xplore \u4e09\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\u641c\u5c0b\u76f8\u95dc\u5df2\u767c\u8868\u7684\u8ad6\u6587\u3002\u5728\u6392\u9664\u7121\u95dc\u8ad6\u6587\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u8a55\u8ad6\u4e2d\u8003\u616e\u4e86\u4e03\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u73fe\u6709\u7684 XAI \u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8655\u7406\u591a\u91cd\u5171\u7dda\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Ahmed M Salih et.al.", "authors": "Ahmed M Salih", "id": "2406.11524v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11524v1", "repo": "null"}}

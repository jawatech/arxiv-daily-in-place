Google DeepMind has pioneered innovations in this field, employing\nreinforcement learning algorithms, including model-based, model-free, and deep\nQ-network approaches, to create advanced AI models such as AlphaGo, AlphaGo\nZero, and MuZero. AlphaGo, the initial model, integrates supervised learning\nand reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, surpassing professional\nhuman players. AlphaGo Zero refines this approach by eliminating reliance on\nhuman gameplay data, instead utilizing self-play for enhanced learning\nefficiency. MuZero further extends these advancements by learning the\nunderlying dynamics of game environments without explicit knowledge of the\nrules, achieving adaptability across various games, including complex Atari\ngames. This paper reviews the significance of reinforcement learning\napplications in Atari and strategy-based games, analyzing these three models,\ntheir key innovations, training processes, challenges encountered, and\nimprovements made. Additionally, we discuss advancements in the field of\ngaming, including MiniZero and multi-agent models, highlighting future\ndirections and emerging AI models from Google DeepMind.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u8a31\u591a\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8a13\u7df4 AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d55\u4f73\u8a13\u7df4\u5834\u3002Google DeepMind \u5728\u6b64\u9818\u57df\u7387\u5148\u5275\u65b0\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7121\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6 Q \u7db2\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5148\u9032\u7684 AI \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 AlphaGo\u3001AlphaGo Zero \u548c MuZero\u3002AlphaGo \u662f\u6700\u521d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u638c\u63e1\u570d\u68cb\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u8077\u696d\u4eba\u985e\u73a9\u5bb6\u3002AlphaGo Zero \u6539\u9032\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u904a\u6232\u6578\u64da\u7684\u4f9d\u8cf4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u73a9\u4f86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b78\u7fd2\u6548\u7387\u3002MuZero \u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u64f4\u5c55\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u5b78\u7fd2\u904a\u6232\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u5e95\u5c64\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u660e\u78ba\u4e86\u89e3\u898f\u5247\uff0c\u4e26\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u8de8\u8d8a\u5404\u7a2e\u904a\u6232\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8907\u96dc\u7684 Atari \u904a\u6232\u3002\u672c\u6587\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u61c9\u7528\u5728 Atari \u548c\u7b56\u7565\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9019\u4e09\u7a2e\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5275\u65b0\u3001\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u3001\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6230\u548c\u6240\u505a\u7684\u6539\u9032\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u904a\u6232\u9818\u57df\u7684\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u5305\u62ec MiniZero \u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86 Google DeepMind \u672a\u4f86\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u65b0\u8208 AI \u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Abdelrhman Shaheen et.al.", "authors": "Abdelrhman Shaheen, Anas Badr, Ali Abohendy, Hatem Alsaadawy, Nadine Alsayad", "id": "2502.10303v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10303v1", "repo": "null"}}

While existing works have explored user emotions or similar\nconcepts in some ToD tasks, none has so far included emotion modelling into a\nfully-fledged ToD system nor conducted interaction with human or simulated\nusers. In this work, we incorporate emotion into the complete ToD processing\nloop, involving understanding, management, and generation. To this end, we\nextend the EmoWOZ dataset (Feng et al., 2022) with system affective behaviour\nlabels. Through interactive experimentation involving both simulated and human\nusers, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the\nuser's emotional experience as well as the task success.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u60c5\u7dd2\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u6e9d\u901a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee5\u4efb\u52d9\u70ba\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71 (ToD) \u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u537b\u7d93\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4efb\u52d9\u6210\u529f\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7126\u9ede\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u73fe\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u63a2\u8a0e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u60c5\u7dd2\u6216\u985e\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b ToD \u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u5c07\u60c5\u7dd2\u5efa\u6a21\u7d0d\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u6210\u719f\u7684 ToD \u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4e5f\u672a\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u6216\u6a21\u64ec\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u9032\u884c\u4e92\u52d5\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u60c5\u7dd2\u7d0d\u5165\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 ToD \u8655\u7406\u8ff4\u5708\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7522\u751f\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u7cfb\u7d71\u60c5\u611f\u884c\u70ba\u6a19\u7c64\u5ef6\u4f38 EmoWOZ \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 (Feng \u7b49\u4eba\uff0c2022)\u3002\u900f\u904e\u6d89\u53ca\u6a21\u64ec\u548c\u4eba\u985e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u9ad4\u9a57\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52d9\u6210\u529f\u3002", "author": "Shutong Feng et.al.", "authors": "Shutong Feng, Hsien-chin Lin, Christian Geishauser, Nurul Lubis, Carel van Niekerk, Michael Heck, Benjamin Ruppik, Renato Vukovic, Milica Ga\u0161i\u0107", "id": "2408.02417v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02417v1", "repo": "null"}}

Metagenomic binning, for instance, relies on genome representations\nto cluster complex mixtures of DNA fragments from biological samples with the\naim of determining their microbial compositions. In this paper, we revisit\nk-mer-based representations of genomes and provide a theoretical analysis of\ntheir use in representation learning. Based on the analysis, we propose a\nlightweight and scalable model for performing metagenomic binning at the genome\nread level, relying only on the k-mer compositions of the DNA fragments. We\ncompare the model to recent genome foundation models and demonstrate that while\nthe models are comparable in performance, the proposed model is significantly\nmore effective in terms of scalability, a crucial aspect for performing\nmetagenomic binning of real-world datasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7372\u5f97 DNA \u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u5c0d\u65bc\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5b8f\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u5206\u7bb1\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7fa4\u96c6\u4f86\u81ea\u751f\u7269\u6a23\u672c\u7684 DNA \u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u78ba\u5b9a\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7d44\u6210\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u91cd\u65b0\u5be9\u8996\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc k-mer \u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8ad6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u8f15\u91cf\u7d1a\u4e14\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u8b80\u53d6\u5c64\u7d1a\u57f7\u884c\u5b8f\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u5206\u7bb1\uff0c\u50c5\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc DNA \u7247\u6bb5\u7684 k-mer \u7d44\u6210\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u8207\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u4e26\u8b49\u660e\u96d6\u7136\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u76f8\u7576\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u986f\u8457\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u57f7\u884c\u5be6\u969b\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u5b8f\u57fa\u56e0\u7d44\u5206\u7bb1\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "author": "Abdulkadir Celikkanat et.al.", "authors": "Abdulkadir Celikkanat, Andres R.

It is generally formulated as a\ntask to recognize the relationship between two entities of interest appearing\nin a free-text sentence. Conventional approaches on RC, regardless of feature\nengineering or deep learning based, can obtain promising performance on\ncategorizing common types of relation leaving a large proportion of\nunrecognizable long-tail relations due to insufficient labeled instances for\ntraining. In this paper, we consider few-shot learning is of great practical\nsignificance to RC and thus improve a modern framework of metric learning for\nfew-shot RC. Specifically, we adopt the large-margin ProtoNet with fine-grained\nfeatures, expecting they can generalize well on long-tail relations. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted by FewRel, a large-scale supervised few-shot RC\ndataset, to evaluate our framework: LM-ProtoNet (FGF). The results demonstrate\nthat it can achieve substantial improvements over many baseline approaches.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u95dc\u4fc2\u5206\u985e (RC) \u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u95dc\u9375\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8868\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8fa8\u8b58\u51fa\u73fe\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u5b57\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5169\u500b\u611f\u8208\u8da3\u5be6\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u7279\u5fb5\u5de5\u7a0b\u9084\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u50b3\u7d71 RC \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c0d\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u985e\u578b\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u7372\u5f97\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u6a19\u7c64\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7121\u6cd5\u8fa8\u8b58\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u9577\u5c3e\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u5c11\u6a23\u672c\u5b78\u7fd2\u5c0d RC \u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u610f\u7fa9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6539\u9032\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u73fe\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u5c11\u6a23\u672c RC\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u5177\u6709\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u5927\u908a\u8ddd ProtoNet\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5728\u9577\u5c3e\u95dc\u4fc2\u4e0a\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6982\u62ec\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u76e3\u7763\u5c11\u6a23\u672c RC \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 FewRel \u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLM-ProtoNet (FGF)\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8a31\u591a\u57fa\u7dda\u65b9\u6cd5\u7372\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u6539\u9032\u3002", "author": "Miao Fan et.al.", "authors": "Miao Fan, Yeqi Bai, Mingming Sun, Ping Li", "id": "2409.04009v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04009v1", "repo": "null"}}

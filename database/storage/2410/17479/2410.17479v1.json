For example, we can swing a bat\nwhen walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing\nthe individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine\nor compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster\nwith fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional\napproach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning\nfor novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method\nis based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the\nfew-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal\nhere is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented\ntrajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the\nerror between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we\npropose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward\nKinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using\nour few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a\nreduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations.\nMoreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by\nteaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u4ee5\u57f7\u884c\u5404\u7a2e\u8eab\u9ad4\u6280\u80fd\u7d44\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u5f9e\u982d\u958b\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8d70\u8def\u6642\u63ee\u68d2\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u901a\u904e\u7d44\u5408\u8d70\u8def\u548c\u63ee\u68d2\u7684\u500b\u5225\u6280\u80fd\u5f9e\u982d\u958b\u59cb\u91cd\u65b0\u5b78\u7fd2\u9019\u7a2e\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8b93\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u5920\u7d44\u5408\u6216\u7d44\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9019\u6a23\u5b83\u5011\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u6a23\u672c\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u540d\u70ba DSE-Diffusion Score Equilibrium \u7684\u65b0\u7d44\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u904e\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u5148\u9a57\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u4f86\u5be6\u73fe\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u65bc\u6982\u7387\u7d44\u5408\u64f4\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u4efb\u4f55\u55ae\u500b\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u64ec\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6578\u64da\u5206\u4f48\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9019\u88e1\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u5c0e\u5411\u8ecc\u8de1\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u500b\u901a\u7528\u6307\u6a19\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6280\u80fd\u6216\u52d5\u4f5c\u8207\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8aa4\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6982\u7387\u6e2c\u91cf - \u524d\u5411\u904b\u52d5\u5b78\u6838\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u7570 (MMD-FK)\uff0c\u5b83\u8207\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u7121\u95dc\u3002\u901a\u904e\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5 DSE\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u6b21\u6578\u4e0a\u5c07 MMD-FK \u6e1b\u5c11 30% \u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5728 5 \u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5411\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u6559\u6388\u65b0\u8ecc\u8de1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Omkar Patil et.al.", "authors": "Omkar Patil, Anant Sah, Nakul Gopalan", "id": "2410.17479v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17479v1", "repo": "null"}}

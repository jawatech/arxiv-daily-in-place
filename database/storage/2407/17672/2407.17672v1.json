Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) specifically\ndeals with instances where the clients have different feature sets of the same\nsamples. As federated learning models aim to improve efficiency and\nadaptability, innovative neural network architectures like Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) are being leveraged to enable fast and accurate processing at\nthe edge. SNNs, known for their efficiency over Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs), have not been analyzed for their applicability in VFL, thus far. In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits and trade-offs of using SNN models in a\nvertical federated learning setting. We implement two different federated\nlearning architectures -- with model splitting and without model splitting --\nthat have different privacy and performance implications. We evaluate the setup\nusing CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmark datasets along with SNN implementations\nof VGG9 and ResNET classification models. Comparative evaluations demonstrate\nthat the accuracy of SNN models is comparable to that of traditional ANNs for\nVFL applications, albeit significantly more energy efficient.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u806f\u90a6\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u8b93\u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u500b\u5ba2\u6236\u7aef\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u7dad\u6301\u8cc7\u6599\u96b1\u79c1\u3002\u5782\u76f4\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2 (VFL) \u7279\u5225\u8655\u7406\u5ba2\u6236\u7aef\u64c1\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6a23\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5fb5\u96c6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u6027\uff0c\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u67b6\u69cb\uff08\u5982\u8108\u885d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (SNNs)\uff09\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u5728\u908a\u7de3\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u5be6\u73fe\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u8655\u7406\u3002\u4ee5\u5176\u9ad8\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (ANNs) \u7684\u6548\u7387\u8457\u7a31\u7684 SNNs\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u91dd\u5c0d\u5176\u5728 VFL \u4e2d\u7684\u9069\u7528\u6027\u9032\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528 SNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u6b0a\u8861\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e86\u5169\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\uff08\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u6c92\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528 CIFAR-10 \u548c CIFAR-100 \u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca VGG9 \u548c ResNET \u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u7684 SNN \u5be6\u4f5c\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3002\u6bd4\u8f03\u8a55\u4f30\u8b49\u660e\uff0cSNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u8207\u50b3\u7d71 ANNs \u5728 VFL \u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u76f8\u7576\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "author": "Maryam Abbasihafshejani et.al.", "authors": "Maryam Abbasihafshejani, Anindya Maiti, Murtuza Jadliwala", "id": "2407.17672v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17672v1", "repo": "null"}}

They can be used to diagnose DM complications, including diabetic\nretinopathy (DR), neuropathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular\ndisease, as well as forecast the risk of cardiovascular events. Artificial\nintelligence (AI)-enabled systems developed for high-throughput detection of DR\nusing digitized retinal images have become clinically adopted. Beyond DR\nscreening, AI integration also holds immense potential to address challenges\nassociated with the holistic care of the patient with DM. In this work, we aim\nto comprehensively review the literature for studies on AI applications based\non retinal images related to DM diagnosis, prognostication, and management. We\nwill describe the findings of holistic AI-assisted diabetes care, including but\nnot limited to DR screening, and discuss barriers to implementing such systems,\nincluding issues concerning ethics, data privacy, equitable access, and\nexplainability. With the ability to evaluate the patient's health status vis a\nvis DM complication as well as risk prognostication of future cardiovascular\ncomplications, AI-assisted retinal image analysis has the potential to become a\ncentral tool for modern personalized medicine in patients with DM.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yasin Sadeghi Bazargani et.al.", "authors": "Yasin Sadeghi Bazargani,Majid Mirzaei,Navid Sobhi,Mirsaeed Abdollahi,Ali Jafarizadeh,Siamak Pedrammehr,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Ru San Tan,Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam,U.

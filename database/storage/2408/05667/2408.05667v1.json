Unlike traditional heuristic or\nmachine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to\nnew threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our\nmodel utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn\ngranular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore,\nPhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance\ncomparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and\nless resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang\nsuccessfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were\nundetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential\nto aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several\nrealistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust\nagainst such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to\ncreate \\textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with\ncontextual information about different features that led to a website being\nmarked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and\ndeveloped a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which\nimplement explainable warnings for end-users.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86 PhishLang\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u958b\u6e90\u3001\u8f15\u91cf\u7d1a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u901a\u904e\u7db2\u7ad9\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4f86\u6aa2\u6e2c\u7db2\u8def\u91e3\u9b5a\u7db2\u7ad9\u3002\u8207\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u975c\u614b\u7279\u5fb5\u4e14\u96e3\u4ee5\u9069\u61c9\u65b0\u5a01\u8105\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u555f\u767c\u5f0f\u6216\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8a08\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u4e86 LLM \u7684\u5148\u9032\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u7db2\u8def\u91e3\u9b5a\u653b\u64ca\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7d30\u5fae\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPhishLang \u4ee5\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u9810\u8655\u7406\u904b\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u8207\u9818\u5148\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5de5\u5177\u76f8\u7576\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u901f\u5ea6\u986f\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u4e14\u8cc7\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5728 3.5 \u500b\u6708\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u671f\u4e2d\uff0cPhishLang \u6210\u529f\u8b58\u5225\u51fa\u5927\u7d04 26K \u500b\u7db2\u8def\u91e3\u9b5a\u7db2\u5740\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8a31\u591a\u7db2\u5740\u672a\u88ab\u71b1\u9580\u7684\u53cd\u7db2\u8def\u91e3\u9b5a\u5c01\u9396\u6e05\u55ae\u6240\u5075\u6e2c\u5230\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u5075\u6e2c\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u91dd\u5c0d PhishLang \u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u7a2e\u5be6\u969b\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u4e26\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u516d\u500b\u4fee\u88dc\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e\u5a01\u8105\u975e\u5e38\u5f37\u5927\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07 PhishLang \u8207 GPT-3.5 Turbo \u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u300c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u5c01\u9396\u6e05\u55ae\u300d\u2014\u2014\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u5411\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u95dc\u5c0e\u81f4\u7db2\u7ad9\u88ab\u6a19\u8a18\u70ba\u7db2\u8def\u91e3\u9b5a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u6e90\u4e86 PhishLang \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e26\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc Chromium \u7684\u700f\u89bd\u5668\u64f4\u5145\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u7db2\u5740\u6383\u63cf\u5668\u7db2\u7ad9\uff0c\u70ba\u6700\u7d42\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5be6\u4f5c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u8b66\u544a\u3002", "author": "Sayak Saha Roy et.al.", "authors": "Sayak Saha Roy, Shirin Nilizadeh", "id": "2408.05667v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667v1", "repo": "null"}}

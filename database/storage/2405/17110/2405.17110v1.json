Accordingly, how to learn\nfrom such data with ambiguous labels is a problem of great practical\nimportance. In this paper, we propose a novel superpixelwise low-rank\napproximation (LRA)-based partial label learning method, namely SLAP, which is\nthe first to take into account partial label learning in HSI classification.\nSLAP is mainly composed of two phases: disambiguating the training labels and\nacquiring the predictive model. Specifically, in the first phase, we propose a\nsuperpixelwise LRA-based model, preparing the affinity graph for the subsequent\nlabel propagation process while extracting the discriminative representation to\nenhance the following classification task of the second phase. Then to\ndisambiguate the training labels, label propagation propagates the labeling\ninformation via the affinity graph of training pixels. In the second phase, we\ntake advantage of the resulting disambiguated training labels and the\ndiscriminative representations to enhance the classification performance. The\nextensive experiments validate the advantage of the proposed SLAP method over\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5c0d\u65bc\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8b5c\u5f71\u50cf (HSI) \u5834\u666f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u5099\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u5c08\u5bb6\u6216\u81ea\u52d5\u6a19\u7c64\u7cfb\u7d71\u5728\u6a19\u7c64\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\u6216\u6a21\u7a1c\u5169\u53ef\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\uff08\u5373\uff0c\u5c07\u6bcf\u500b\u8a13\u7df4\u6a23\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7d66\u4e00\u7d44\u5019\u9078\u6a19\u7c64\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff1b\u9019\u4e5f\u7a31\u70ba\u90e8\u5206\u6a19\u7c64\u5b78\u7fd2\uff09\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5f9e\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u7a1c\u5169\u53ef\u6a19\u7c64\u7684\u6b64\u985e\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c (LRA) \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6a19\u7c64\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba SLAP\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5728 HSI \u5206\u985e\u4e2d\u8003\u616e\u90e8\u5206\u6a19\u7c64\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002SLAP \u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u5169\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\uff1a\u6d88\u9664\u8a13\u7df4\u6a19\u7c64\u7684\u6b67\u7fa9\u548c\u7372\u53d6\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20 LRA \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u70ba\u5f8c\u7e8c\u6a19\u7c64\u50b3\u64ad\u904e\u7a0b\u6e96\u5099\u89aa\u548c\u5716\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u53d6\u5224\u5225\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u7b2c\u4e8c\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u5f8c\u7e8c\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u6d88\u9664\u8a13\u7df4\u6a19\u7c64\u7684\u6b67\u7fa9\uff0c\u6a19\u7c64\u50b3\u64ad\u901a\u904e\u8a13\u7df4\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u89aa\u548c\u5716\u50b3\u64ad\u6a19\u7c64\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u7fa9\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u6a19\u7c64\u548c\u5224\u5225\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u5206\u985e\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SLAP \u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u512a\u52e2\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Shujun Yang et.al.", "authors": "Shujun Yang, Yu Zhang, Yao Ding, Danfeng Hong", "id": "2405.17110v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17110v1", "repo": "null"}}

Specifically,\nwe applied the quantum support vector classifier (QSVC) and quantum neural\nnetwork (QNN), and we showed that the QSVC is easier to implement and yields a\nhigher accuracy. The QSVC models were applied for three kernels: Linear,\npolynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), and it was shown that the\npolynomial and RBF kernels had exactly the same performance. The QNN model was\napplied using different optimizers, learning rates, noise on the circuit\ncomponents, and weight initializations were considered, but the QNN\npersistently ran into the dead neuron problem. Thus, the QNN was compared only\nby accraucy and loss, and it was shown that with the Adam optimizer, the model\nhas the best performance, however, still less than the QSVC.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8003\u616e\u4e86 QML \u6280\u8853\u5728\u5357\u975e\u5fb7\u73ed U20A \u5730\u5340\u6c34\u8cea\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u61c9\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u985e\u5668 (QSVC) \u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (QNN)\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e QSVC \u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5be6\u73fe\u4e26\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002QSVC \u6a21\u578b\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u4e09\u7a2e\u6838\uff1a\u7dda\u6027\u3001\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u548c\u5f91\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6578 (RBF)\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u548c RBF \u6838\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002QNN \u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u512a\u5316\u5668\u3001\u5b78\u7fd2\u7387\u3001\u96fb\u8def\u7d44\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u566a\u8072\uff0c\u4e26\u8003\u616e\u6b0a\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46 QNN \u6301\u7e8c\u9047\u5230\u6b7b\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u554f\u984c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u50c5\u901a\u904e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u640d\u5931\u5c0d QNN \u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4f7f\u7528 Adam \u512a\u5316\u5668\u6642\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f4e\u65bc QSVC\u3002", "author": "Muhammad Al-Zafar Khan et.al.", "authors": "Muhammad Al-Zafar Khan, Jamal Al-Karaki, Marwan Omar", "id": "2411.18141v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18141v1", "repo": "null"}}

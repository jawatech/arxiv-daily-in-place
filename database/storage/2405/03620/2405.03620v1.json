This\nhas driven a rising interest in automated machine learning solutions.\nTransformers, a cutting-edge category of attention-based deep learning methods,\nhave demonstrated remarkable success. In this paper, we present BERTroid, an\ninnovative malware detection model built on the BERT architecture. Overall,\nBERTroid emerged as a promising solution for combating Android malware. Its\nability to outperform state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its potential as\na proactive defense mechanism against malicious software attacks. Additionally,\nwe evaluate BERTroid on multiple datasets to assess its performance across\ndiverse scenarios. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, our approach has\ndemonstrated promising resilience against the rapid evolution of malware on\nAndroid systems. While the machine learning model captures broad patterns, we\nemphasize the role of manual validation for deeper comprehension and insight\ninto these behaviors. This human intervention is critical for discerning\nintricate and context-specific behaviors, thereby validating and reinforcing\nthe model's findings.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Meryam Chaieb et.al.", "authors": "Meryam Chaieb,Mostafa Anouar Ghorab,Mohamed Aymen Saied", "id": "2405.03620v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03620v1", "repo": "null"}}

To truly understand how and why\npeople interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states\nthat give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in\nmulti-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often\nmulti-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or\nread about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely\ninteract with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand\npeople's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental\nstates based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we\nintroduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark.\nMuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates\nmental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide\nvideo and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic\nhousehold environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about\npeople's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM\nin a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel\nmulti-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse\nMulti-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u5011\u5728\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ef0\u8cf4\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u70ba\u4f55\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5fc5\u9808\u63a8\u8ad6\u51fa\u5c0e\u81f4\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5fc3\u7406\u72c0\u614b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u591a\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u4e92\u52d5\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8ad6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52d5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u7684\u2014\u2014\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c0\u5bdf\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3001\u8046\u807d\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\uff0c\u548c/\u6216\u95b1\u8b80\u95dc\u65bc\u4ed6\u5011\u904e\u53bb\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8b93 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u80fd\u5920\u6210\u529f\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8207\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5011\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72c0\u614b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u5011\u6839\u64da\u95dc\u65bc\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5c0d\u5f7c\u6b64\u5fc3\u7406\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u63a8\u8ad6\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 MuMA-ToM\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u591a\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8ad6\u57fa\u6e96\u3002MuMA-ToM \u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8ad6\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u5177\u9ad4\u5316\u591a\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u4e92\u52d5\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5728 MuMA-ToM \u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u5f71\u7247\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u8aaa\u660e\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u8108\u7d61\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a62\u554f\u6709\u95dc\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u4ed6\u4eba\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86 MuMA-ToM\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eba\u985e\u57fa\u6e96\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u591a\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406 ToM \u6a21\u578b\uff0cLIMP\uff08\u57fa\u65bc\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u591a\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u898f\u5283\uff09\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0cLIMP \u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 GPT-4o\u3001Gemini-1.5 Pro\uff09\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b ToM \u6a21\u578b BIP-ALM\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Haojun Shi et.al.", "authors": "Haojun Shi, Suyu Ye, Xinyu Fang, Chuanyang Jin, Leyla Isik, Yen-Ling Kuo, Tianmin Shu", "id": "2408.12574v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12574v2", "repo": "null"}}

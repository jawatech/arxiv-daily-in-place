Our approach, the Concept Hierarchy, provides the\nnecessary information for autonomous systems to represent environment states,\nperform action modeling and recognition, and plan the execution of tasks.\nAdditionally, the hierarchical structure supports generalization and knowledge\ntransfer to environments. We rigorously define tasks, actions, skills, and\naffordances that enable human-understandable action and skill recognition.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u8868\u793a\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u975c\u614b\u548c\u52d5\u614b\u7d44\u6210\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u7269\u4ef6\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u767c\u751f\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4ee3\u7406\u57f7\u884c\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u968e\u5c64\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u9ad4\u7cfb\u7d71\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u74b0\u5883\u72c0\u614b\u3001\u57f7\u884c\u52d5\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8fa8\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u898f\u5283\u4efb\u52d9\u57f7\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u968e\u5c64\u7d50\u69cb\u652f\u63f4\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u8f49\u79fb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u56b4\u8b39\u5730\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u4efb\u52d9\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5b9a\u7fa9\u80fd\u5920\u5be6\u73fe\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u8fa8\u8b58\u3002", "author": "Andrei Costinescu et.al.", "authors": "Andrei Costinescu, Luis Figueredo, Darius Burschka", "id": "2409.08853v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08853v1", "repo": "null"}}

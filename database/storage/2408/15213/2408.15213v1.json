Common qualitative measurements like holistic grading or content\nanalysis require great amounts of time and labour, making it difficult to\nquickly scope out which politicians should be classified as populist and which\nshould not, while quantitative methods show mixed results when it comes to\nclassifying populist rhetoric. In this paper, we develop a pipeline to train\nand validate an automated classification model to estimate the use of populist\nlanguage. We train models based on sentences that were identified as populist\nand pluralist in 300 US governors' speeches from 2010 to 2018 and in 45\nspeeches of presidential candidates in 2016. We find that these models classify\nmost speeches correctly, including 84% of governor speeches and 89% of\npresidential speeches. These results extend to different time periods (with 92%\naccuracy on more recent American governors), different amounts of data (with as\nfew as 70 training sentences per category achieving similar results), and when\nclassifying politicians instead of individual speeches. This pipeline is thus\nan effective tool that can optimise the systematic and swift classification of\nthe use of populist language in politicians' speeches.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7d93\u5e38\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u96e3\u4ee5\u6e2c\u91cf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6e2c\u91cf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6574\u9ad4\u8a55\u5206\u6216\u5167\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6642\u9593\u548c\u52de\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u653f\u6cbb\u4eba\u7269\u61c9\u88ab\u6b78\u985e\u70ba\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8005\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u4e0d\u61c9\u88ab\u6b78\u985e\u70ba\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8005\u8b8a\u5f97\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u800c\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0d\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8a00\u8ad6\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u6642\u5247\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7ba1\u9053\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u52d5\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8a08\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u5728 2010 \u5e74\u81f3 2018 \u5e74\u9593 300 \u4f4d\u7f8e\u570b\u5dde\u9577\u6f14\u8b1b\u4e2d\u88ab\u78ba\u5b9a\u70ba\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u548c\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u7fa9\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 2016 \u5e74 45 \u4f4d\u7e3d\u7d71\u5019\u9078\u4eba\u7684\u6f14\u8b1b\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u78ba\u5730\u5c0d\u5927\u591a\u6578\u6f14\u8b1b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec 84% \u7684\u5dde\u9577\u6f14\u8b1b\u548c 89% \u7684\u7e3d\u7d71\u6f14\u8b1b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u679c\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6642\u9593\u6bb5\uff08\u5c0d\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7f8e\u570b\u5dde\u9577\u6709 92% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6578\u64da\u91cf\uff08\u6bcf\u985e\u5225\u5c11\u81f3 70 \u500b\u8a13\u7df4\u53e5\u5b50\u5373\u53ef\u7372\u5f97\u985e\u4f3c\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5c0d\u653f\u6cbb\u4eba\u7269\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c0d\u500b\u5225\u6f14\u8b1b\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u6642\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u7ba1\u9053\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u5316\u5c0d\u653f\u6cbb\u4eba\u7269\u6f14\u8b1b\u4e2d\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8a9e\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u6cc1\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5206\u985e\u3002", "author": "Olaf van der Veen et.al.", "authors": "Olaf van der Veen, Semir Dzebo, Levi Littvay, Kirk Hawkins, Oren Dar", "id": "2408.15213v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15213v1", "repo": "null"}}

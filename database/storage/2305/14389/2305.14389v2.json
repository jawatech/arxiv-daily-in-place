Early detection is crucial, yet mammography\ninterpretation is hindered by high false positives and negatives. With BC\nincidence projected to surpass lung cancer, improving early detection methods\nis vital. Thermography, using high-resolution infrared cameras, offers promise,\nespecially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). This work presents\nan attention-based convolutional neural network for segmentation, providing\nincreased speed and precision in BC detection and classification. The system\nenhances images and performs cancer segmentation with explainable AI. We\npropose a transformer-attention-based convolutional architecture (UNet) for\nfault identification and employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping\n(Grad-CAM) to analyze areas of bias and weakness in the UNet architecture with\nIRT images. The superiority of our proposed framework is confirmed when\ncompared with existing deep learning frameworks.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jai Vardhan et.al.", "authors": "Jai Vardhan,Taraka Satya Krishna Teja Malisetti", "id": "2305.14389v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14389v2", "repo": "null"}}

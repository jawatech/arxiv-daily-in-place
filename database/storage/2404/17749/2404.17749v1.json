We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology\ncases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the\ncapabilities of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our\ninvestigation reveals that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can\naccurately retrieve the correct skin condition 85% of the time using\ndermatological images and brief patient histories. Additionally, we empirically\nshow that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) works well for retrieval while Medical\nGuidelines Grounded CoT is required for accurate dermatological diagnosis.\nFurther, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework and show its\nsuperior performance and potential over the best CoT strategy. The experiments\nsuggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent conversation for\ncritique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate diagnosis of\ndermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to improving\ndiagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing\npatient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Parth Vashisht et.al.", "authors": "Parth Vashisht,Abhilasha Lodha,Mukta Maddipatla,Zonghai Yao,Avijit Mitra,Zhichao Yang,Junda Wang,Sunjae Kwon,Hong Yu", "id": "2404.17749v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17749v1", "repo": "https://github.com/parth166/m3g-clinicaldermatology"}}

There has been progress in the last five years from theoretical\nstudies and numerical simulations to proof of concepts. Use cases demonstrated\non contemporary quantum devices include classifying medical images and items\nfrom the Iris dataset, classifying and generating handwritten images, toxicity\nscreening, and learning a probability distribution. Potential benefits of QML\ninclude faster training and identification of feature maps not found\nclassically. Although, these examples lack the scale for commercial\nexploitation, and it may be several years before QML algorithms replace the\nclassical solutions, QML is an exciting area.\n  This article is written for those who already have a sound knowledge of\nquantum computing and now wish to gain a basic overview of the terminology and\nsome applications of classical machine learning ready to study quantum machine\nlearning. The reader will already understand the relevant relevant linear\nalgebra, including Hilbert spaces, a vector space with an inner product.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Daniel Goldsmith et.al.", "authors": "Daniel Goldsmith,M M Hassan Mahmud", "id": "2404.18555v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18555v1", "repo": "null"}}

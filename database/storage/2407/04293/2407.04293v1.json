The\nlatency is the time span from audio input to the output of the corresponding\nspeaker label. As part of the evaluation, various model combinations within the\nDIART framework, a diarization system based on the online clustering algorithm\nUIS-RNN-SML, and the end-to-end online diarization system FS-EEND are compared.\nThe lowest latency is achieved for the DIART-pipeline with the embedding model\npyannote/embedding and the segmentation model pyannote/segmentation. The\nFS-EEND system shows a similarly good latency. In general there is currently no\npublished research that compares several online diarization systems in terms of\ntheir latency. This makes this work even more relevant.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u9072\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u786c\u9ad4\u548c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u8cc7\u6599\u8a55\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u65e5\u8a18\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u5ef6\u9072\u662f\u6307\u5f9e\u97f3\u8a0a\u8f38\u5165\u5230\u5c0d\u61c9\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u6a19\u7c64\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u6642\u9593\u7bc4\u570d\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u7dda\u4e0a\u805a\u985e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5 UIS-RNN-SML \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u65e5\u8a18\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71 DIART \u6846\u67b6\u5167\u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u6a21\u578b\u7d44\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7aef\u5c0d\u7aef\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u65e5\u8a18\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71 FS-EEND\u3002\u5ef6\u9072\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u662f\u63a1\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b pyannote/embedding \u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b pyannote/segmentation \u7684 DIART-pipeline\u3002FS-EEND \u7cfb\u7d71\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u985e\u4f3c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5ef6\u9072\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6c92\u6709\u5df2\u767c\u8868\u7684\u91dd\u5c0d\u5ef6\u9072\u6bd4\u8f03\u591a\u500b\u7dda\u4e0a\u65e5\u8a18\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5177\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002", "author": "Roman Aperdannier et.al.", "authors": "Roman Aperdannier, Sigurd Schacht, Alexander Piazza", "id": "2407.04293v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04293v1", "repo": "null"}}

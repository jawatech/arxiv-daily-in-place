The absence of a precise mathematical framework for moral\nreasoning intensifies these concerns, as ethics often defies simplistic\nmathematical models. Unlike fields such as logical reasoning, reasoning under\nuncertainty, and strategic decision-making, which have well-defined\nmathematical frameworks, moral reasoning lacks a broadly accepted framework.\nThis absence raises questions about the confidence we can place in AI's moral\ndecision-making capabilities.\n  The environments in which AI systems are typically trained today seem\ninsufficiently rich for such a system to learn ethics from scratch, and even if\nwe had an appropriate environment, it is unclear how we might bring about such\nlearning. An alternative approach involves AI learning from human moral\ndecisions. This learning process can involve aggregating curated human\njudgments or demonstrations in specific domains, or leveraging a foundation\nmodel fed with a wide range of data. Still, concerns persist, given the\nimperfections in human moral decision making.\n  Given this, why should we ever automate moral decision making -- is it not\nbetter to leave all moral decision making to humans? This paper lays out a\nnumber of reasons why we should expect AI systems to engage in decisions with a\nmoral component, with brief discussions of the associated risks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u4eba\u5011\u666e\u904d\u76f8\u4fe1 AI \u80fd\u5728\u751f\u6d3b\u5404\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u6c7a\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u7576 AI \u53c3\u8207\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u5927\u9053\u5fb7\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u6642\uff0c\u5c31\u6703\u7522\u751f\u7591\u616e\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u6846\u67b6\u4f86\u9032\u884c\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u52a0\u5287\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u7591\u616e\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9053\u5fb7\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u7c21\u5316\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8207\u908f\u8f2f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u7b49\u9818\u57df\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\u6709\u660e\u78ba\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800c\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u537b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u7f3a\u5931\u5f15\u767c\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u5c0d AI \u9053\u5fb7\u6c7a\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u63d0\u51fa\u8cea\u7591\u3002\n  AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u5728\u7576\u4eca\u63a5\u53d7\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8b93\u6b64\u985e\u7cfb\u7d71\u5f9e\u982d\u5b78\u7fd2\u9053\u5fb7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u6709\u9069\u7576\u7684\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6211\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u5be6\u73fe\u9019\u7a2e\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca AI \u5f9e\u4eba\u985e\u9053\u5fb7\u6c7a\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u6b64\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u5f59\u6574\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u7d93\u904e\u7b56\u5283\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u5224\u65b7\u6216\u793a\u7bc4\uff0c\u6216\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u91cf\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u9053\u5fb7\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7591\u616e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\n  \u6709\u9451\u65bc\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8981\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u2014\u2014\u96e3\u9053\u5c07\u6240\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u7559\u7d66\u4eba\u985e\u4e0d\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u55ce\uff1f\u672c\u6587\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u61c9\u671f\u5f85 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u53c3\u8207\u5177\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u6210\u5206\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e26\u7c21\u8981\u8a0e\u8ad6\u76f8\u95dc\u98a8\u96aa\u3002", "author": "Vincent Conitzer et.al.", "authors": "Vincent Conitzer", "id": "2407.07671v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07671v1", "repo": "null"}}

To address this bottleneck,\nwe present self-taught lookahead, a self-supervised method that leverages\nstate-transition dynamics to train a value model capable of effectively guiding\nlanguage model-controlled search. We find that moderately sized (8 billion\nparameters) open-weight value models improved with self-taught lookahead can\nmatch the performance of using a frontier LLM such as gpt-4o as the value\nmodel. Furthermore, we find that self-taught lookahead improves performance by\n20% while reducing costs 37x compared to previous LLM-based tree search,\nwithout relying on ground truth rewards.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u6b65\u9a5f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4efb\u52d9\u5b8c\u6210\u734e\u52f5\u6216\u4eba\u985e\u6f14\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u8017\u6642\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7db2\u9801\u4efb\u52d9\u7b49\u4e92\u52d5\u9818\u57df\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u500b\u74f6\u9838\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u5b78\u5f0f\u524d\u77bb\uff08self-taught lookahead\uff09\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u81ea\u6211\u76e3\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u72c0\u614b\u8f49\u79fb\u52d5\u614b\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u4e00\u500b\u80fd\u5920\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5c0e\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u7d93\u904e\u81ea\u5b78\u5f0f\u524d\u77bb\u6539\u9032\u7684\u4e2d\u7b49\u898f\u6a21\uff0880 \u5104\u53c3\u6578\uff09\u958b\u653e\u6b0a\u91cd\u50f9\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9054\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 gpt-4o\uff09\u4f5c\u70ba\u50f9\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u8207\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a39\u72c0\u641c\u5c0b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u81ea\u5b78\u5f0f\u524d\u77bb\u5728\u5c07\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e 37 \u500d\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u9084\u5c07\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 20%\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7121\u9700\u4f9d\u8cf4\u771f\u5be6\u734e\u52f5\u3002</paragraph>\n", "author": "Ethan Mendes et.al.", "authors": "Ethan Mendes, Alan Ritter", "id": "2503.02878v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02878v1", "repo": "null"}}

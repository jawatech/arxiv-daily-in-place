In this work, we focus on zero-shot\nnavigation ability using given abstract $2$-D top-down maps. Like human\nnavigation by reading a paper map, the agent reads the map as an image when\nnavigating in a novel layout, after learning to navigate on a set of training\nmaps. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach for this\nmulti-task learning problem, where it jointly learns a hypermodel that takes\ntop-down maps as input and predicts the weights of the transition network. We\nuse the DeepMind Lab environment and customize layouts using generated maps.\nOur method can adapt better to novel environments in zero-shot and is more\nrobust to noise.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5c0e\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6c7a\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6230\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u7d66\u5b9a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61 $2$-D \u4fef\u77b0\u5730\u5716\u7684\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u5c0e\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u4eba\u985e\u900f\u904e\u95b1\u8b80\u7d19\u672c\u5730\u5716\u4f86\u5c0e\u822a\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u4e00\u7d44\u8a13\u7df4\u5730\u5716\u4e0a\u5c0e\u822a\u5f8c\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c0e\u822a\u6642\u5c07\u5730\u5716\u8996\u70ba\u5f71\u50cf\u4f86\u95b1\u8b80\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u5b78\u7fd2\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b83\u806f\u5408\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5c07\u4fef\u77b0\u5730\u5716\u4f5c\u70ba\u8f38\u5165\u4e26\u9810\u6e2c\u50b3\u905e\u7db2\u8def\u6b0a\u91cd\u7684\u8d85\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528 DeepMind Lab \u74b0\u5883\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u81ea\u8a02\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9069\u61c9\u65b0\u7684\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0d\u96dc\u8a0a\u66f4\u5177\u9b6f\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "author": "Linfeng Zhao et.al.", "authors": "Linfeng Zhao, Lawson L.

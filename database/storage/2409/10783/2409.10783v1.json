In fact, many ancient Chinese texts contain thousands of lines\nwith no distinct punctuation marks or delimiters in sight. The lack of\npunctuation in such texts makes it difficult for humans to identify when there\npauses or breaks between particular phrases and understand the semantic meaning\nof the written text (Mogahed, 2012). As a result, unless one was educated in\nthe ancient time period, many readers of ancient Chinese would have\nsignificantly different interpretations of the texts. We propose an approach to\npredict the location (and type) of punctuation in ancient Chinese texts that\nextends the work of Oh et al (2017) by leveraging a bidirectional multi-layered\nLSTM with a multi-head attention mechanism as inspired by Luong et al.'s (2015)\ndiscussion of attention-based architectures. We find that the use of\nmulti-layered LSTMs and multi-head attention significantly outperforms RNNs\nthat don't incorporate such components when evaluating ancient Chinese texts.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u76f4\u5230 20 \u4e16\u7d00\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u624d\u958b\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\u3002\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u672c\u5305\u542b\u6578\u5343\u884c\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u660e\u986f\u7684\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\u6216\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u865f\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\uff0c\u8b93\u4eba\u5011\u96e3\u4ee5\u8b58\u5225\u7279\u5b9a\u77ed\u8a9e\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u505c\u9813\u6216\u9593\u9694\uff0c\u4e26\u7406\u89e3\u66f8\u9762\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u542b\u7fa9 (Mogahed, 2012)\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u53d7\u904e\u53e4\u4ee3\u6642\u671f\u7684\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u5426\u5247\u8a31\u591a\u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6587\u8b80\u8005\u5c0d\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8a6e\u91cb\u5c07\u6709\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u7570\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e (\u548c\u985e\u578b)\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u904e\u5229\u7528\u96d9\u5411\u591a\u5c64 LSTM \u8207\u591a\u982d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u4f86\u64f4\u5c55 Oh \u7b49\u4eba (2017) \u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9748\u611f\u4f86\u81ea Luong \u7b49\u4eba (2015) \u5c0d\u57fa\u65bc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5728\u8a55\u4f30\u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u672c\u6642\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c64 LSTM \u548c\u591a\u982d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u672a\u6574\u5408\u6b64\u985e\u7d44\u4ef6\u7684 RNN\u3002", "author": "Tracy Cai et.al.", "authors": "Tracy Cai, Kimmy Chang, Fahad Nabi", "id": "2409.10783v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10783v1", "repo": "null"}}

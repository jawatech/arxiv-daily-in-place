However,\ntraditional multimodal approaches often fail to address real-world challenges\nsuch as incomplete data and modality loss. In this study, a Flexible Multimodal\nTransformer (FMT) was proposed, which uses ResNet-50 and BERT for joint\nrepresentation learning, followed by a dynamic masked attention strategy that\nsimulates clinical modality loss to improve robustness; finally, a sequential\nmixture of experts (MOE) architecture was used to achieve multi-level decision\nrefinement. After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT\nachieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1\nscore, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the\nmedical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal\ndiagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u900f\u904e\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4f86\u63d0\u9ad8\u80ba\u708e\u8a3a\u65b7\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7121\u6cd5\u61c9\u5c0d\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6a21\u614b\u7f3a\u5931\u3002 \u5728\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u9748\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b Transformer (FMT)\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528 ResNet-50 \u548c BERT \u9032\u884c\u806f\u5408\u8868\u5fb5\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u63a1\u7528\u52d5\u614b\u906e\u7f69\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u6a21\u64ec\u81e8\u5e8a\u6a21\u614b\u7f3a\u5931\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a69\u5065\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9806\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c08\u5bb6 (MOE) \u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u5c64\u7d1a\u6c7a\u7b56\u512a\u5316\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u80ba\u708e\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\u5f8c\uff0cFMT \u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u70ba 94%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u70ba 95%\uff0cF1 \u503c\u70ba 93%\uff0c\u512a\u65bc\u55ae\u6a21\u614b\u57fa\u6e96\uff08ResNet\uff1a89%\uff1bBERT\uff1a79%\uff09\u548c\u91ab\u5b78\u57fa\u6e96 CheXMed (90%)\uff0c\u70ba\u8cc7\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u80ba\u708e\u8a3a\u65b7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002</paragraph>\n", "author": "Jingyu Xu et.al.", "authors": "Jingyu Xu, Yang Wang", "id": "2503.05626v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05626v1", "repo": "null"}}

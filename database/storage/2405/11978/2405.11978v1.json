We then\nintroduce the Stability Modulated Dynamic Time Warping algorithm for\nincorporating the stability regions, i.e. the most similar parts between two\nsignatures, into the distance measure between a pair of signatures computed by\nthe Dynamic Time Warping for signature verification. Experiments were conducted\non two datasets largely adopted for performance evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the\nbaseline system and compares favourably with other top performing signature\nverification systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u624b\u5beb\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u57f7\u884c\u904b\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb\u5728\u4e3b\u9ad4\u7c3d\u540d\u591a\u6b21\u57f7\u884c\u671f\u9593\u5be6\u969b\u57f7\u884c\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u4e26\u63a8\u6e2c\u7c3d\u540d\u4e2d\u6700\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u61c9\u5728\u7c3d\u540d\u9a57\u8b49\u671f\u9593\u8a55\u4f30\u6709\u7591\u554f\u7684\u7c3d\u540d\u8207\u53c3\u8003\u7c3d\u540d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6642\u767c\u63ee\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u8abf\u88fd\u52d5\u614b\u6642\u9593\u898f\u6574\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c07\u7a69\u5b9a\u5340\u57df\uff08\u5373\u5169\u500b\u7c3d\u540d\u4e4b\u9593\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff09\u7d0d\u5165\u7531\u52d5\u614b\u6642\u9593\u898f\u6574\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u7684\u7c3d\u540d\u5c0d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u6e2c\u91cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u7c3d\u540d\u9a57\u8b49\u3002\u5728\u5169\u500b\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a1\u7528\u65bc\u6548\u80fd\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u57fa\u6e96\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u9802\u5c16\u7684\u7c3d\u540d\u9a57\u8b49\u7cfb\u7d71\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\u8868\u73fe\u826f\u597d\u3002", "author": "Antonio Parziale et.al.", "authors": "Antonio Parziale, Moises Diaz, Miguel A.

Because it can structure a document to facilitate its understanding,\nit has been widely applied in many fields~(medical, commercial, and scientific\ndomains). Despite its broad utilization, ASL remains a challenging task because\nit involves examining the complex relationships between the sentences in a\npotentially unstructured discourse. To resolve this problem, we have developed\na simple yet effective approach called Dual-tower Multi-scale cOnvolution\nneural Network~(DMON) for the ASL task. Specifically, we organize arguments\ninto a relationship matrix that together with the argument embeddings forms a\nrelationship tensor and design a mechanism to capture relations with contextual\narguments. Experimental results on three different-domain argument mining\ndatasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/DMON.git .", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Wei Sun et.al.", "authors": "Wei Sun,Mingxiao Li,Jingyuan Sun,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens", "id": "2405.01216v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01216v1", "repo": "https://github.com/vrcmf/dmon"}}

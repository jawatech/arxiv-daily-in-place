However, research indicates that DNNs are\nsusceptible to adversarial examples, and this is equally true in the\nmulti-label domain. To further investigate multi-label adversarial examples, we\nintroduce a novel type of attacks, termed \"Showing Many Labels\". The objective\nof this attack is to maximize the number of labels included in the classifier's\nprediction results. In our experiments, we select nine attack algorithms and\nevaluate their performance under \"Showing Many Labels\". Eight of the attack\nalgorithms were adapted from the multi-class environment to the multi-label\nenvironment, while the remaining one was specifically designed for the\nmulti-label environment. We choose ML-LIW and ML-GCN as target models and train\nthem on four popular multi-label datasets: VOC2007, VOC2012, NUS-WIDE, and\nCOCO. We record the success rate of each algorithm when it shows the expected\nnumber of labels in eight different scenarios. Experimental results indicate\nthat under the \"Showing Many Labels\", iterative attacks perform significantly\nbetter than one-step attacks. Moreover, it is possible to show all labels in\nthe dataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (DNN) \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5df2\u88ab\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u8a31\u591a\u9818\u57df\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e DNN \u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u985e\u578b\u7684\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u300c\u986f\u793a\u8a31\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u300d\u3002\u6b64\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5206\u985e\u5668\u9810\u6e2c\u7d50\u679c\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\u6578\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9078\u64c7\u4e86\u4e5d\u7a2e\u653b\u64ca\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u300c\u986f\u793a\u8a31\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u300d\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u516b\u7a2e\u653b\u64ca\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f9e\u591a\u985e\u5225\u74b0\u5883\u6539\u7de8\u70ba\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u5247\u5c08\u9580\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u74b0\u5883\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9078\u64c7 ML-LIW \u548c ML-GCN \u4f5c\u70ba\u76ee\u6a19\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u56db\u500b\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u5b83\u5011\uff1aVOC2007\u3001VOC2012\u3001NUS-WIDE \u548c COCO\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a18\u9304\u4e86\u6bcf\u500b\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u516b\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u986f\u793a\u9810\u671f\u6a19\u7c64\u6578\u91cf\u6642\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u300c\u986f\u793a\u8a31\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u300d\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u55ae\u6b65\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u6a19\u7c64\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "author": "Yujiang Liu et.al.", "authors": "Yujiang Liu, Wenjian Luo, Zhijian Chen, Muhammad Luqman Naseem", "id": "2409.17568v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17568v1", "repo": "null"}}

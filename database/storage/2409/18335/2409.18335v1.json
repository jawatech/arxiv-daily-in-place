{"2409.18335": {"publish_time": "2024-09-26", "title": "A Fairness-Driven Method for Learning Human-Compatible Negotiation Strategies", "paper_summary": "Despite recent advancements in AI and NLP, negotiation remains a difficult\ndomain for AI agents. Traditional game theoretic approaches that have worked\nwell for two-player zero-sum games struggle in the context of negotiation due\nto their inability to learn human-compatible strategies. On the other hand,\napproaches that only use human data tend to be domain-specific and lack the\ntheoretical guarantees provided by strategies grounded in game theory.\nMotivated by the notion of fairness as a criterion for optimality in general\nsum games, we propose a negotiation framework called FDHC which incorporates\nfairness into both the reward design and search to learn human-compatible\nnegotiation strategies. Our method includes a novel, RL+search technique called\nLGM-Zero which leverages a pre-trained language model to retrieve\nhuman-compatible offers from large action spaces. Our results show that our\nmethod is able to achieve more egalitarian negotiation outcomes and improve\nnegotiation quality.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1 AI \u548c NLP \u8fd1\u671f\u6709\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8ac7\u5224\u5c0d AI \u4ee3\u7406\u4f86\u8aaa\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u56f0\u96e3\u7684\u9818\u57df\u3002\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8ad6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96d9\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u7121\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u8ac7\u5224\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u6703\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u985e\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u535a\u5f08\u8ad6\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u4fdd\u8b49\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u7e3d\u548c\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f5c\u70ba\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u9019\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6fc0\u52f5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba FDHC \u7684\u8ac7\u5224\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c07\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7d0d\u5165\u734e\u52f5\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u641c\u5c0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u8ac7\u5224\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684 RL+search \u6280\u8853\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba LGM-Zero\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f9e\u5927\u578b\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u64f7\u53d6\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u5831\u50f9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u9054\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u8ac7\u5224\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u5347\u8ac7\u5224\u54c1\u8cea\u3002", "author": "Ryan Shea et.al.", "authors": "Ryan Shea, Zhou Yu", "id": "2409.18335v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18335v1", "repo": "null"}}

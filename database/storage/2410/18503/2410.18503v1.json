However, most of these architectures rely on\nconvolutions that hardly model long-range dependencies, limiting their ability\nto extract contextual information. In order to tackle this issue, this article\nintroduces the Swin Filtering Block network (SFB-net) which takes advantage of\nboth conventional and swin transformer layers. The former are used to introduce\nspatial attention at the bottom of the network, while the latter are applied to\nfocus on high level semantically rich features between the encoder and decoder.\nAn average Dice score of 92.4 was achieved on the ACDC dataset. To the best of\nour knowledge, this result outperforms any other work on this dataset. The\naverage Dice score of 87.99 obtained on the M\\&amp;M's dataset demonstrates\nthat the proposed method generalizes well to data from different vendors and\ncentres.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u5fc3\u81df\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u67b6\u69cb\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u96e3\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u9577\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u7684\u5377\u7a4d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86 Swin Filtering Block \u7db2\u8def (SFB-net)\uff0c\u5b83\u540c\u6642\u5229\u7528\u50b3\u7d71\u548c swin transformer \u5c64\u3002\u524d\u8005\u7528\u65bc\u5728\u7db2\u8def\u5e95\u90e8\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u9593\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5f8c\u8005\u7528\u65bc\u95dc\u6ce8\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u78bc\u5668\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u9ad8\u5c64\u8a9e\u7fa9\u8c50\u5bcc\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u5728 ACDC \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9054\u5230\u4e86 92.4 \u7684\u5e73\u5747 Dice \u5206\u6578\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u6b64\u7d50\u679c\u512a\u65bc\u8a72\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5728 M&amp;M's \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7372\u5f97\u7684 87.99 \u7684\u5e73\u5747 Dice \u5206\u6578\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u63a8\u5ee3\u5230\u4f86\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9b\u61c9\u5546\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u3002", "author": "Nicolas Portal et.al.", "authors": "Nicolas Portal, Nadjia Kachenoura, Thomas Dietenbeck, Catherine Achard", "id": "2410.18503v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18503v1", "repo": "null"}}

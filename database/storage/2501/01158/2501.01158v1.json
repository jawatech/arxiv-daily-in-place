{"2501.01158": {"publish_time": "2025-01-02", "title": "Leveraging Full Dependency Parsing Graph Information For Biomedical Event Extraction", "paper_summary": "Many models are proposed in the literature on biomedical event\nextraction(BEE). Some of them use the shortest dependency path(SDP) information\nto represent the argument classification task. There is an issue with this\nrepresentation since even missing one word from the dependency parsing graph\nmay totally change the final prediction. To this end, the full adjacency matrix\nof the dependency graph is used to embed individual tokens using a graph\nconvolutional network(GCN). An ablation study is also done to show the effect\nof the dependency graph on the overall performance. The results show a\nsignificant improvement when dependency graph information is used. The proposed\nmodel slightly outperforms state-of-the-art models on BEE over different\ndatasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8403\u53d6\uff08BEE\uff09\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u77ed\u4f9d\u5b58\u8def\u5f91\uff08SDP\uff09\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u8868\u793a\u8ad6\u8b49\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u9019\u500b\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5373\u4f7f\u5f9e\u4f9d\u5b58\u89e3\u6790\u5716\u4e2d\u907a\u6f0f\u4e00\u500b\u5b57\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6539\u8b8a\u6700\u7d42\u9810\u6e2c\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u4f9d\u5b58\u5716\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u9130\u63a5\u77e9\u9663\u7528\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u5716\u5f62\u5377\u7a4d\u7db2\u8def\uff08GCN\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u500b\u5225\u7b26\u865f\u3002\u9084\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u986f\u793a\u4f9d\u5b58\u5716\u5c0d\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u7576\u4f7f\u7528\u4f9d\u5b58\u5716\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6642\uff0c\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 BEE \u4e0a\u7565\u52dd\u904e\u4e0d\u540c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Farshad Noravesh et.al.", "authors": "Farshad Noravesh, Reza Haffari, Ong Huey Fang, Layki Soon, Sailaja Rajalana, Arghya Pal", "id": "2501.01158v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01158v1", "repo": "null"}}

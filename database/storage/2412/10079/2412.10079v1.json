Thus far, the problem has mainly only been considered in settings\nwith single pieces of critical information, leading us to question what happens\nwhen multiple necessary pieces of information are spread out over the inputs.\nHere, we demonstrate the effects of the \"lost in the middle\" problem in the\nmulti-hop question answering setting -- in which multiple reasoning \"hops\" over\ndisconnected documents are required -- and show that performance degrades not\nonly with respect to the distance of information from the edges of the context,\nbut also between pieces of information. Additionally, we experiment with means\nof alleviating the problem by reducing superfluous document contents through\nknowledge graph triple extraction and summarization, and prompting models to\nreason more thoroughly using chain-of-thought prompting.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u9577\u8a9e\u5883\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7121\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8f38\u5165\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u4f4d\u65bc\u5c3e\u7aef\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u7576\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u4f7f\u7528\u8f38\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u3002\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u70ba\u6b62\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u4e3b\u8981\u53ea\u5728\u5177\u6709\u55ae\u4e00\u95dc\u9375\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u88ab\u8003\u616e\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u6211\u5011\u8cea\u7591\u7576\u591a\u500b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7247\u6bb5\u6563\u4f48\u5728\u8f38\u5165\u4e2d\u6642\u6703\u767c\u751f\u4ec0\u9ebc\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u5728\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u793a\u7bc4\u4e86\u300c\u907a\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u9593\u300d\u554f\u984c\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u554f\u7b54\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u8d8a\u672a\u9023\u63a5\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u300c\u8df3\u8e8d\u300d\uff0c\u4e26\u986f\u793a\u6548\u80fd\u4e0d\u50c5\u6703\u96a8\u8457\u8cc7\u8a0a\u8207\u8a9e\u5883\u908a\u7de3\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e5f\u6703\u96a8\u8457\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7247\u6bb5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5be6\u9a57\u4e86\u900f\u904e\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4e09\u5143\u7d44\u8403\u53d6\u548c\u6458\u8981\u4f86\u6e1b\u5c11\u591a\u9918\u6587\u4ef6\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u93c8\u63d0\u793a\u4f86\u66f4\u5fb9\u5e95\u5730\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e1b\u8f15\u554f\u984c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "George Arthur Baker et.al.", "authors": "George Arthur Baker, Ankush Raut, Sagi Shaier, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense", "id": "2412.10079v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10079v1", "repo": "null"}}

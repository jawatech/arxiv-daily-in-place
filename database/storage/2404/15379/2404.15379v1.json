This motivates the objective of discovering\ntypical care pathways from patient data. Revealing homogeneous groups of care\npathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care\npathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a\nsemantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms.\n  In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to time\nsequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of\naveraged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering\nalgorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed\nsequences.\n  This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real use\ncases.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Thomas Guyet et.al.", "authors": "Thomas Guyet,Pierre Pinson,Enoal Gesny", "id": "2404.15379v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15379v1", "repo": "null"}}

When the training and test distributions are\nmismatched, artifacts and hallucinations can occur in reconstructed images due\nto the incorrect priors. In this work, we systematically study out of\ndistribution (OOD) problems where a known training distribution is first\nprovided. We first study the setting where only a single measurement obtained\nfrom the unknown test distribution is available. Next we study the setting\nwhere a very small sample of data belonging to the test distribution is\navailable, and our goal is still to reconstruct an image from a measurement\nthat came from the test distribution. In both settings, we use a patch-based\ndiffusion prior that learns the image distribution solely from patches.\nFurthermore, in the first setting, we include a self-supervised loss that helps\nthe network output maintain consistency with the measurement. Extensive\nexperiments show that in both settings, the patch-based method can obtain high\nquality image reconstructions that can outperform whole-image models and can\ncompete with methods that have access to large in-distribution training\ndatasets. Furthermore, we show how whole-image models are prone to memorization\nand overfitting, leading to artifacts in the reconstructions, while a\npatch-based model can resolve these issues.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u65bc\u80fd\u5920\u5b78\u7fd2\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5148\u9a57\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u9006\u5411\u554f\u984c\u4e0a\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u500b\u5927\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u61c9\u8207\u6e2c\u8a66\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4f86\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7576\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6e2c\u8a66\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6642\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5148\u9a57\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u51fa\u73fe\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u548c\u5e7b\u89ba\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u5206\u5e03\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916 (OOD) \u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u50c5\u5f9e\u672a\u77e5\u6e2c\u8a66\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u55ae\u4e00\u6e2c\u91cf\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u5c6c\u65bc\u6e2c\u8a66\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6975\u5c0f\u6578\u64da\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5f9e\u6e2c\u8a66\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4f86\u7684\u6e2c\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5f71\u50cf\u3002\u5728\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u5340\u584a\u7684\u64f4\u6563\u5148\u9a57\uff0c\u50c5\u5f9e\u5340\u584a\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u6211\u76e3\u7763\u640d\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u7db2\u8def\u8f38\u51fa\u8207\u6e2c\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5340\u584a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7372\u5f97\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u512a\u65bc\u6574\u9ad4\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8207\u6709\u5b58\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5167\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7af6\u722d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6574\u9ad4\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8a18\u61b6\u548c\u904e\u5ea6\u64ec\u5408\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u51fa\u73fe\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u65bc\u5340\u584a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Jason Hu et.al.", "authors": "Jason Hu, Bowen Song, Jeffrey A.

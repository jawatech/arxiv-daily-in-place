{"2405.19973": {"publish_time": "2024-05-30", "title": "A Triumvirate of AI Driven Theoretical Discovery", "paper_summary": "Recent years have seen the dramatic rise of the usage of AI algorithms in\npure mathematics and fundamental sciences such as theoretical physics. This is\nperhaps counter-intuitive since mathematical sciences require the rigorous\ndefinitions, derivations, and proofs, in contrast to the experimental sciences\nwhich rely on the modelling of data with error-bars. In this Perspective, we\ncategorize the approaches to mathematical discovery as \"top-down\", \"bottom-up\"\nand \"meta-mathematics\", as inspired by historical examples. We review some of\nthe progress over the last few years, comparing and contrasting both the\nadvances and the short-comings in each approach. We argue that while the\ntheorist is in no way in danger of being replaced by AI in the near future, the\nhybrid of human expertise and AI algorithms will become an integral part of\ntheoretical discovery.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7d14\u6578\u5b78\u548c\u7406\u8ad6\u7269\u7406\u7b49\u57fa\u790e\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9019\u6216\u8a31\u6709\u9055\u76f4\u89ba\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6578\u5b78\u79d1\u5b78\u9700\u8981\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u3001\u63a8\u5c0e\u548c\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u9019\u8207\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u8aa4\u5dee\u7bc4\u570d\u6578\u64da\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u79d1\u5b78\u5f62\u6210\u5c0d\u6bd4\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u89c0\u9ede\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6578\u5b78\u767c\u73fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b78\u985e\u70ba\u300c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u300d\u3001\u300c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u300d\u548c\u300c\u5143\u6578\u5b78\u300d\uff0c\u9748\u611f\u4f86\u81ea\u6b77\u53f2\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u5e74\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e26\u5c0d\u6bd4\u6bcf\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u548c\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u7406\u8ad6\u5bb6\u5728\u4e0d\u4e45\u7684\u5c07\u4f86\u7d55\u4e0d\u6703\u88ab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u53d6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u985e\u5c08\u5bb6\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7d50\u5408\u5c07\u6210\u70ba\u7406\u8ad6\u767c\u73fe\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "author": "Yang-Hui He et.al.", "authors": "Yang-Hui He", "id": "2405.19973v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19973v1", "repo": "null"}}

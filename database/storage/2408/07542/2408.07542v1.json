Prototype Quality Evaluation", "paper_summary": "Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded\nas one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural\nareas. Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent\nteacher lesson planning. As the government pushes towards the implementation of\na new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is\nworsened. Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a\nprototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the\ngovernment-accredited textbooks. This helps teachers create lesson plans more\nefficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new\ncurriculum and the competence-based learning approach.\n  Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings,\nand LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.\nVector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT,\nMathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lessons plans were\ngenerated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested\nperiods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their\ntechnical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan\nAnalysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically\ndesigned for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.\n  Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average\nquality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to \"very good lesson plan\". None\nof the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued\nto have been missing the topic. In conclusion, the quality of the generated\nlesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by\nhumans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even\nreached the benchmark of 50%.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5f15\u8a00\uff1a\u70cf\u5e72\u9054 21 \u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u4e8c\u7d1a\u5b78\u6821\u6559\u80b2\u54c1\u8cea\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e3b\u8981\u96e3\u984c\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fb2\u6751\u5730\u5340\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u54c1\u8cea\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u653f\u5e9c\u63a8\u52d5\u5be6\u65bd\u65b0\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u5df2\u904e\u6642\uff0c\u554f\u984c\u4e5f\u96a8\u4e4b\u60e1\u5316\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u6aa2\u7d22\u64f4\u5145\u7522\u751f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u64da\u653f\u5e9c\u8a8d\u53ef\u7684\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u7522\u751f\u5ba2\u88fd\u5316\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u3002\u9019\u80fd\u5354\u52a9\u6559\u5e2b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u54c1\u8cea\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u8207\u65b0\u8ab2\u7a0b\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u57fa\u790e\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9019\u500b\u539f\u578b\u4f7f\u7528 Cohere LLM \u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca LangChain \u67b6\u69cb\u6240\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u4e4b\u5f8c\u518d\u516c\u958b\u65bc\u7db2\u7ad9\u4e0a\u3002\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e09\u672c\u65b0\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\uff08\u8cc7\u8a0a\u8207\u901a\u8a0a\u6280\u8853\u3001\u6578\u5b78\u3001\u6b77\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u5728\u4e2d\u5b78\u4e00\u5e74\u7d1a\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u5132\u5b58\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u4e2d\u5efa\u8b70\u7684\u6642\u6bb5\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u507d\u96a8\u6a5f\u7522\u751f\u5354\u5b9a\u7522\u751f\u4e86 24 \u500b\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u3002\u4e09\u500b\u7368\u7acb\u8a55\u5206\u54e1\u6839\u64da Ndihokubwayo \u7b49\u4eba\uff082022 \u5e74\uff09\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u5206\u6790\u5354\u5b9a\uff08LPAP\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u7684\u6280\u8853\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u8a72\u5354\u5b9a\u7279\u5225\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u6771\u975e\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u57fa\u790e\u8ab2\u7a0b\u3002\n\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528 LPAP \u8a55\u4f30 24 \u500b\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u54c1\u8cea\u4ecb\u65bc 75% \u5230 80%\uff0c\u76f8\u7576\u65bc\u300c\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u300d\u3002\u6c92\u6709\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u7684\u5206\u6578\u4f4e\u65bc 65%\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u4eba\u8a8d\u70ba\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u907a\u6f0f\u4e86\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u7d50\u8ad6\u662f\uff0c\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u54c1\u8cea\u81f3\u5c11\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u76f8\u7576\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u76e7\u5b89\u9054\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u793a\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6559\u5b78\u8a08\u756b\u9054\u5230 50% \u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Simon Kloker et.al.", "authors": "Simon Kloker, Herbertson Bukoli, Twaha Kateete", "id": "2408.07542v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07542v1", "repo": "null"}}

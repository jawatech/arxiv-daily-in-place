However, their impact on\nalgorithmic fairness is not well understood yet. Algorithmic fairness\ninvestigates how a model's performance varies across different groups,\ntypically defined by protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this\nwork, we investigate the interplay between the performance gains from Deep\nEnsembles and fairness. Our analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different\ngroups in what we refer to as a disparate benefits effect. We empirically\ninvestigate this effect with Deep Ensembles applied to popular facial analysis\nand medical imaging datasets, where protected group attributes are given and\nfind that it occurs for multiple established group fairness metrics, including\nstatistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we identify the\nper-group difference in predictive diversity of ensemble members as the\npotential cause of the disparate benefits effect. Finally, we evaluate\ndifferent approaches to reduce unfairness due to the disparate benefits effect.\nOur findings show that post-processing is an effective method to mitigate this\nunfairness while preserving the improved performance of Deep Ensembles.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u9810\u6e2c\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u7c21\u55ae\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u56e0\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u7d44\u800c\u7570\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7fa4\u7d44\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u53d7\u4fdd\u8b77\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5e74\u9f61\u3001\u6027\u5225\u6216\u7a2e\u65cf\uff09\u5b9a\u7fa9\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8207\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5206\u6790\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u5747\u52fb\u5730\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u7d44\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u597d\u8655\u6548\u61c9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4ee5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u6d41\u884c\u9762\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5c0d\u6b64\u6548\u61c9\u9032\u884c\u5be6\u8b49\u63a2\u8a0e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53d7\u4fdd\u8b77\u7fa4\u7d44\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u767c\u73fe\u5b83\u767c\u751f\u5728\u591a\u500b\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7fa4\u7d44\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6a19\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7d71\u8a08\u540c\u7b49\u6027\u548c\u6a5f\u6703\u5747\u7b49\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u9810\u6e2c\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u5728\u96c6\u5408\u6210\u54e1\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u7d44\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u8996\u70ba\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u597d\u8655\u6548\u61c9\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e1b\u5c11\u7531\u65bc\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u597d\u8655\u6548\u61c9\u800c\u5c0e\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f8c\u8655\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u7559\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "author": "Kajetan Schweighofer et.al.", "authors": "Kajetan Schweighofer, Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez, Sepp Hochreiter, Nuria Oliver", "id": "2410.13831v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13831v1", "repo": "null"}}

The knowledge state plays a\nkey role in learning process. However, considering that the knowledge state is\ninfluenced by various learning factors in the interaction process, such as the\nexercises similarities, responses reliability and the learner's learning state.\nPrevious models still face two major limitations. First, due to the exercises\ndifferences caused by various complex reasons and the unreliability of\nresponses caused by guessing behavior, it is hard to locate the historical\ninteraction which is most relevant to the current answered exercise. Second,\nthe learning state is also a key factor to influence the knowledge state, which\nis always ignored by previous methods. To address these issues, we propose a\nnew method named Learning State Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (LSKT). Firstly, to\nsimulate the potential differences in interactions, inspired by Item Response\nTheory~(IRT) paradigm, we designed three different embedding methods ranging\nfrom coarse-grained to fine-grained views and conduct comparative analysis on\nthem. Secondly, we design a learning state extraction module to capture the\nchanging learning state during the learning process of the learner. In turn,\nwith the help of the extracted learning state, a more detailed knowledge state\ncould be captured. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that\nour LSKT method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u8ffd\u8e64 (KT) \u4efb\u52d9\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u6839\u64da\u6b77\u53f2\u4e92\u52d5\u9810\u6e2c\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u77e5\u8b58\u72c0\u614b\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u95dc\u9375\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8003\u616e\u5230\u77e5\u8b58\u72c0\u614b\u6703\u53d7\u5230\u4e92\u52d5\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u7a2e\u5b78\u7fd2\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7df4\u7fd2\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u81e8\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u8907\u96dc\u539f\u56e0\u9020\u6210\u7684\u7df4\u7fd2\u5dee\u7570\u4ee5\u53ca\u731c\u6e2c\u884c\u70ba\u9020\u6210\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5f88\u96e3\u627e\u5230\u8207\u7576\u524d\u5df2\u56de\u7b54\u7df4\u7fd2\u6700\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u4e92\u52d5\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u4e5f\u662f\u5f71\u97ff\u77e5\u8b58\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7e3d\u662f\u5ffd\u7565\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u540d\u70ba\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u589e\u5f37\u77e5\u8b58\u8ffd\u8e64 (LSKT) \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u6a21\u64ec\u4e92\u52d5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u5728\u9805\u76ee\u53cd\u61c9\u7406\u8ad6 (IRT) \u5178\u7bc4\u7684\u555f\u767c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e09\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7bc4\u570d\u5f9e\u7c97\u7565\u5230\u7d30\u7dfb\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u53cd\u904e\u4f86\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u5e6b\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u66f4\u8a73\u7d30\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u72c0\u614b\u3002\u5728\u56db\u500b\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684 LSKT \u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u7576\u524d\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Shanshan Wang et.al.", "authors": "Shanshan Wang, Xueying Zhang, Keyang Wang, Xun Yang, Xingyi Zhang", "id": "2412.19550v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19550v1", "repo": "null"}}

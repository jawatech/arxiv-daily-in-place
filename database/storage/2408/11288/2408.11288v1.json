However, the effectiveness of these models in clinical\nsettings remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to assess the current\ngenerative applications of LLMs in mental health care, focusing on studies\nwhere these models were tested with human participants in real-world scenarios.\nA systematic search across APA PsycNet, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science\nidentified 726 unique articles, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. These\nstudies encompassed applications such as clinical assistance, counseling,\ntherapy, and emotional support. However, the evaluation methods were often\nnon-standardized, with most studies relying on ad hoc scales that limit\ncomparability and robustness. Privacy, safety, and fairness were also\nfrequently underexplored. Moreover, reliance on proprietary models, such as\nOpenAI's GPT series, raises concerns about transparency and reproducibility.\nWhile LLMs show potential in expanding mental health care access, especially in\nunderserved areas, the current evidence does not fully support their use as\nstandalone interventions. More rigorous, standardized evaluations and ethical\noversight are needed to ensure these tools can be safely and effectively\nintegrated into clinical practice.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6b63\u4f5c\u70ba\u5fc3\u7406\u4fdd\u5065\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6d6e\u73fe\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u7522\u751f\u985e\u4eba\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u78ba\u3002\u672c\u7bc4\u570d\u63a2\u8a0e\u65e8\u5728\u8a55\u4f30 LLM \u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u4fdd\u5065\u4e2d\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u751f\u6210\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u4ee5\u4eba\u985e\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u6e2c\u8a66\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u641c\u5c0b APA PsycNet\u3001Scopus\u3001PubMed \u548c Web of Science \u627e\u51fa 726 \u7bc7\u7368\u7279\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d 17 \u7bc7\u7b26\u5408\u7d0d\u5165\u6a19\u6e96\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u84cb\u81e8\u5e8a\u5354\u52a9\u3001\u8aee\u8a62\u3001\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u60c5\u7dd2\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u672a\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f03\u6027\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u7684\u81e8\u6642\u91cf\u8868\u3002\u96b1\u79c1\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e5f\u7d93\u5e38\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8a0e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u5c08\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 OpenAI \u7684 GPT \u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u6703\u5f15\u767c\u5c0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8907\u88fd\u6027\u7684\u7591\u616e\u3002\u96d6\u7136 LLM \u5728\u64f4\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u4fdd\u5065\u670d\u52d9\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73fe\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u670d\u52d9\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5730\u5340\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8b49\u64da\u4e26\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u652f\u6301\u5c07\u5176\u7528\u4f5c\u7368\u7acb\u5e72\u9810\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u56b4\u8b39\u3001\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u502b\u7406\u76e3\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u5230\u81e8\u5e8a\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\u3002", "author": "Yining Hua et.al.", "authors": "Yining Hua, Hongbin Na, Zehan Li, Fenglin Liu, Xiao Fang, David Clifton, John Torous", "id": "2408.11288v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11288v1", "repo": "null"}}

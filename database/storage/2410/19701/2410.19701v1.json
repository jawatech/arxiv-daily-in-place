Most of the\ntraditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them\nprone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not\nmeet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer\nbetter resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one\nanother and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the\nCircuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign\nresources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure\npropagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under\nexternal failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of\nabove 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address\nthis, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which\nmanaged to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user\nrequests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in\nreal-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain\nfailures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that\nthe use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50%\ndecrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use\nof monolithic architectures. These findings affirm the capability of\nmicroservices in the development of robust and flexible airline ticket booking\nsystems that are responsive to change and recover from external system\nunavailability.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u8a02\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7d71\u958b\u767c\u4e2d\u7d0d\u5165\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6578\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u8a02\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7d71\u975e\u5e38\u50f5\u5316\u4e14\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u5011\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73fe\u74f6\u9838\u548c\u55ae\u9ede\u6545\u969c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u7121\u6cd5\u6eff\u8db3\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u73fe\u4ee3\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5fa9\u539f\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u4e9b\u670d\u52d9\u5f7c\u6b64\u7368\u7acb\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u7368\u7acb\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u65b7\u8def\u5668\u6a21\u5f0f\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u8cc7\u6e90\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u822a\u73ed API \u548c\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7d71\uff09\u6642\u7dad\u6301\u5bb9\u932f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9019\u5c07\u6545\u969c\u50b3\u64ad\u5230\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6a5f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 60%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7d71\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u904b\u4f5c\u3002\u6d41\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8def\u7531\u4e5f\u52a0\u5f37\u4e86\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u4fdd\u8b49\u4e86\u5728\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u9054\u5230 99.95% \u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u904b\u884c\u6642\u9593\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8ca0\u8f09\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5faa\u74b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5728\u670d\u52d9\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e4b\u9593\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u914d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5c07\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 35%\u3002\u5065\u5eb7\u6aa2\u67e5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5373\u6642\u76e3\u63a7\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u5728\u7cfb\u7d71\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u97ff\u4e4b\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u6545\u969c\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7d71\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 40%\uff0c\u505c\u6a5f\u6642\u9593\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e86 50%\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u55ae\u9ad4\u67b6\u69cb\u652f\u63f4\u591a 30% \u7684\u4e26\u767c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u80af\u5b9a\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u5728\u958b\u767c\u5065\u58ef\u4e14\u9748\u6d3b\u7684\u6a5f\u7968\u8a02\u8cfc\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u8b8a\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u61c9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u4e2d\u5fa9\u539f\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Biman Barua et.al.", "authors": "Biman Barua, M.

We identify a property, which we call\nstrong compositionality, that applies for many natural kinds of preference\nstatement, and that allows a greedy algorithm for determining consistency of a\nset of preference statements. We also consider different natural definitions of\noptimality, and their relations to each other, for general preference languages\nbased on lexicographic models. Based on our framework, we show that testing\nconsistency, and thus inference, is polynomial for a specific preference\nlanguage LpqT, which allows strict and non-strict statements, comparisons\nbetween outcomes and between partial tuples, both ceteris paribus and strong\nstatements, and their combination. Computing different kinds of optimal sets is\nalso shown to be polynomial; this is backed up by our experimental results.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f86\u5206\u6790\u504f\u597d\u63a8\u8ad6\uff0c\u4ee5\u57fa\u65bc\u5b57\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u504f\u597d\u8a9e\u8a00\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8fa8\u8b58\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u5f37\u7d44\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u8a31\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u985e\u578b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u9673\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e14\u5141\u8a31\u4f7f\u7528\u8caa\u5a6a\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f86\u5224\u65b7\u504f\u597d\u9673\u8ff0\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u8003\u616e\u57fa\u65bc\u5b57\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u504f\u597d\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7136\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6211\u5011\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u8ad6\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5141\u8a31\u56b4\u683c\u548c\u975e\u56b4\u683c\u9673\u8ff0\u3001\u7d50\u679c\u4e4b\u9593\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5143\u7d44\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u3001ceteris paribus \u548c\u5f37\u9673\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u8a9e\u8a00 LpqT \u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u7684\u3002\u8a08\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u96c6\u5408\u4e5f\u88ab\u986f\u793a\u70ba\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u7684\uff1b\u9019\u7531\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u652f\u6301\u3002", "author": "Nic Wilson et.al.", "authors": "Nic Wilson, Anne-Marie George", "id": "2410.23913v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23913v1", "repo": "null"}}

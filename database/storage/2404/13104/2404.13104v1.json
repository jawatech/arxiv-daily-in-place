As per the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), in 2023, over 280 million individuals are grappling with\ndepression. This is a huge number; if not taken seriously, these numbers will\nincrease rapidly. About 4.89 billion individuals are social media users. People\nexpress their feelings and emotions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook,\nReddit, Instagram, etc. These platforms contain valuable information which can\nbe used for research purposes. Considerable research has been conducted across\nvarious social media platforms. However, certain limitations persist in these\nendeavors. Particularly, previous studies were only focused on detecting\ndepression and the intensity of depression in tweets. Also, there existed\ninaccuracies in dataset labeling. In this research work, five types of\ndepression (Bipolar, major, psychotic, atypical, and postpartum) were predicted\nusing tweets from the Twitter database based on lexicon labeling. Explainable\nAI was used to provide reasoning by highlighting the parts of tweets that\nrepresent type of depression. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) was used for feature extraction and training. Machine\nlearning and deep learning methodologies were used to train the model. The BERT\nmodel presented the most promising results, achieving an overall accuracy of\n0.96.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Muhammad Osama Nusrat et.al.", "authors": "Muhammad Osama Nusrat,Waseem Shahzad,Saad Ahmed Jamal", "id": "2404.13104v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13104v1", "repo": "https://github.com/mnusrat786/masters-thesis"}}

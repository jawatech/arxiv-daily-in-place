{"2501.05501": {"publish_time": "2025-01-09", "title": "Strategy Masking: A Method for Guardrails in Value-based Reinforcement Learning Agents", "paper_summary": "The use of reward functions to structure AI learning and decision making is\ncore to the current reinforcement learning paradigm; however, without careful\ndesign of reward functions, agents can learn to solve problems in ways that may\nbe considered ``undesirable\" or ``unethical. Without thorough understanding of\nthe incentives a reward function creates, it can be difficult to impose\nprincipled yet general control mechanisms over its behavior. In this paper, we\nstudy methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward\nfunctions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we\ncall strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI\nagent behavior. We apply our method to study lying in AI agents and show that\nstrategy masking can effectively modify agent behavior by suppressing, or\nactively penalizing, the reward dimension for lying such that agents act more\nhonestly while not compromising their ability to perform effectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4f7f\u7528\u734e\u52f5\u51fd\u6578\u4f86\u5efa\u69cb AI \u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u662f\u7576\u524d\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u7bc4\u4f8b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u82e5\u734e\u52f5\u51fd\u6578\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e0d\u5468\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5b78\u6703\u4ee5\u300c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u300d\u6216\u300c\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u300d\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u6c7a\u554f\u984c\u3002\u82e5\u4e0d\u5fb9\u5e95\u4e86\u89e3\u734e\u52f5\u51fd\u6578\u6240\u5275\u9020\u7684\u8a98\u56e0\uff0c\u5c31\u96e3\u4ee5\u5c0d\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u65bd\u52a0\u6709\u539f\u5247\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6a5f\u5236\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5efa\u69cb\u9632\u8b77\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f9b\u4f7f\u7528\u734e\u52f5\u51fd\u6578\u5b78\u7fd2\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u7684 AI \u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u7b56\u7565\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u660e\u78ba\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e26\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u7684 AI \u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7814\u7a76 AI \u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u8aaa\u8b0a\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4e26\u8b49\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u906e\u7f69\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6291\u5236\u6216\u4e3b\u52d5\u61f2\u7f70\u8aaa\u8b0a\u7684\u734e\u52f5\u7dad\u5ea6\uff0c\u8b93\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u66f4\u8aa0\u5be6\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e0d\u640d\u5bb3\u5176\u6709\u6548\u57f7\u884c\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "author": "Jonathan Keane et.al.", "authors": "Jonathan Keane, Sam Keyser, Jeremy Kedziora", "id": "2501.05501v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05501v1", "repo": "null"}}

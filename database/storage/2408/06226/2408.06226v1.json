{"2408.06226": {"publish_time": "2024-08-12", "title": "A Large-Scale Study of Model Integration in ML-Enabled Software Systems", "paper_summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) and its embedding in systems has\ndrastically changed the engineering of software-intensive systems.\nTraditionally, software engineering focuses on manually created artifacts such\nas source code and the process of creating them, as well as best practices for\nintegrating them, i.e., software architectures. In contrast, the development of\nML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the ML\nmodels and their training data. However, to deliver value to end users, these\nML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complex\ntopologies. In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many different\nML models. While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems\nhave been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is known\nabout the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems. Properly embedding\nML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is far\nfrom trivial. We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems,\nwhich we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabled\nsoftware systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub. We\nclassified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well as\ntheir practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture of\nthese systems. Our findings provide practitioners and researchers with insight\ninto practices for embedding and integrating ML models, bringing data science\nand software engineering closer together.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5fb9\u5e95\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u8edf\u9ad4\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\n\u50b3\u7d71\u4e0a\uff0c\u8edf\u9ad4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6210\u54c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u539f\u59cb\u78bc\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u5408\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5be6\u52d9\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8edf\u9ad4\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\n\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0cML \u6210\u54c1\u7684\u958b\u767c\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f ML \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f86\u81ea\u65bc\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\uff0c\u4e26\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc ML \u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u50f9\u503c\u7d66\u6700\u7d42\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b ML \u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u9808\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5f62\u6210\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u62d3\u64b2\u3002\n\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\uff0c\u555f\u7528 ML \u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f15\u6613\u5730\u6574\u5408\u8a31\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 ML \u6a21\u578b\u3002\n\u96d6\u7136\u5efa\u69cb\u555f\u7528 ML \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6311\u6230\u548c\u5be6\u52d9\u5df2\u7d93\u5728\u67d0\u7a2e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u9664\u4e86\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u555f\u7528 ML \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7279\u6027\u6240\u77e5\u751a\u5c11\u3002\n\u9069\u7576\u5730\u5c07 ML \u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u8f15\u6613\u5730\u7dad\u8b77\u6216\u91cd\u8907\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9060\u975e\u6613\u4e8b\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u9700\u8981\u6539\u5584\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7d93\u9a57\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u63d0\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u771f\u5be6\u555f\u7528 ML \u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb\u4e86 GitHub \u4e0a\u8d85\u904e 2,928 \u500b\u958b\u6e90\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u5b9a\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u91cd\u8907\u4f7f\u7528 ML \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u95dc\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u7684\u5be6\u52d9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u70ba\u5be6\u52d9\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c0d\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6574\u5408 ML \u6a21\u578b\u5be6\u52d9\u7684\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u8b93\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\u548c\u8edf\u9ad4\u5de5\u7a0b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "author": "Yorick Sens et.al.", "authors": "Yorick Sens, Henriette Knopp, Sven Peldszus, Thorsten Berger", "id": "2408.06226v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06226v1", "repo": "null"}}

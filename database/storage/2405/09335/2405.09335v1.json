Data annotation, in contrast, is a\ntime-consuming process. This especially applies to Question Answering, where\npossibly large documents have to be parsed and annotated with questions and\ntheir corresponding answers. Furthermore, Question Answering models often only\nwork well for the domain they were trained on. Since annotation is costly, we\nargue that domain-agnostic knowledge from LMs, such as linguistic\nunderstanding, is sufficient to create a well-curated dataset. With this\nmotivation, we show that using large language models can improve Question\nAnswering performance on various datasets in the few-shot setting compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches. For this, we perform data generation leveraging\nthe Prompting framework, suggesting that language models contain valuable\ntask-agnostic knowledge that can be used beyond the common\npre-training/fine-tuning scheme. As a result, we consistently outperform\nprevious approaches on few-shot Question Answering.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LM) \u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u554f\u7b54\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u76f8\u8f03\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8cc7\u6599\u6a19\u8a3b\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8017\u6642\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u9019\u7279\u5225\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u554f\u7b54\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5fc5\u9808\u89e3\u6790\u5927\u578b\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u554f\u984c\u53ca\u5176\u5c0d\u61c9\u7b54\u6848\u9032\u884c\u6a19\u8a3b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u554f\u7b54\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u53d7\u8a13\u7684\u9818\u57df\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u6a19\u8a3b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e3b\u5f35\u4f86\u81ea LM \u7684\u8207\u9818\u57df\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8a9e\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u7d93\u904e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5283\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u52d5\u6a5f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u6a23\u672c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8207\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u554f\u7b54\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u8cc7\u6599\u7522\u751f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u8207\u4efb\u52d9\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u65bc\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u9810\u8a13\u7df4/\u5fae\u8abf\u67b6\u69cb\u4e4b\u5916\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5c0f\u6a23\u672c\u554f\u7b54\u4e2d\u59cb\u7d42\u512a\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Maximilian Schmidt et.al.", "authors": "Maximilian Schmidt, Andrea Bartezzaghi, Ngoc Thang Vu", "id": "2405.09335v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09335v1", "repo": "null"}}

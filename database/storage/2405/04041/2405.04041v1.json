{"2405.04041": {"publish_time": "2024-05-07", "title": "Feature Map Convergence Evaluation for Functional Module", "paper_summary": "Autonomous driving perception models are typically composed of multiple\nfunctional modules that interact through complex relationships to accomplish\nenvironment understanding. However, perception models are predominantly\noptimized as a black box through end-to-end training, lacking independent\nevaluation of functional modules, which poses difficulties for interpretability\nand optimization. Pioneering in the issue, we propose an evaluation method\nbased on feature map analysis to gauge the convergence of model, thereby\nassessing functional modules' training maturity. We construct a quantitative\nmetric named as the Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS) and develop Feature\nMap Convergence Evaluation Network (FMCE-Net) to measure and predict the\nconvergence degree of models respectively. FMCE-Net achieves remarkable\npredictive accuracy for FMCS across multiple image classification experiments,\nvalidating the efficacy and robustness of the introduced approach. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first independent evaluation method for\nfunctional modules, offering a new paradigm for the training assessment towards\nperception models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u591a\u500b\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u7d44\u7d44\u6210\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u7d44\u900f\u904e\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u9032\u884c\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u74b0\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u900f\u904e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ed1\u76d2\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u6700\u4f73\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0d\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u7368\u7acb\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u9020\u6210\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u91dd\u5c0d\u6b64\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u7279\u5fb5\u5716\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u6582\u6027\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u8a55\u4f30\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u69cb\u4e00\u500b\u7a31\u70ba\u7279\u5fb5\u5716\u6536\u6582\u8a55\u5206 (FMCS) \u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u958b\u767c\u7279\u5fb5\u5716\u6536\u6582\u8a55\u4f30\u7db2\u8def (FMCE-Net) \u4f86\u5206\u5225\u6e2c\u91cf\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u6582\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002FMCE-Net \u5728\u591a\u500b\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0d FMCS \u9054\u5230\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u7368\u7acb\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u70ba\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8a55\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5178\u7bc4\u3002", "author": "Ludan Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Ludan Zhang, Chaoyi Chen, Lei He, Keqiang Li", "id": "2405.04041v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04041v1", "repo": "null"}}

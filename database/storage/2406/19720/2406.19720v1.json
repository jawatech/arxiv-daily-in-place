Enhancing the gaming\nexperience requires a deep understanding of player behavior, and a crucial\naspect of MOBA games is matchmaking, which aims to assemble teams of comparable\nskill levels. However, existing matchmaking systems often neglect important\nfactors such as players' position preferences and team assignment, resulting in\nimbalanced matches and reduced player satisfaction. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a novel framework called CUPID, which\nintroduces a novel process called ``re-matchmaking'' to optimize team and\nposition assignments to improve both fairness and player satisfaction. CUPID\nincorporates a pre-filtering step to ensure a minimum level of matchmaking\nquality, followed by a pre-match win-rate prediction model that evaluates the\nfairness of potential assignments. By simultaneously considering players'\nposition satisfaction and game fairness, CUPID aims to provide an enhanced\nmatchmaking experience. Extensive experiments were conducted on two\nlarge-scale, real-world MOBA datasets to validate the effectiveness of CUPID.\nThe results surpass all existing state-of-the-art baselines, with an average\nrelative improvement of 7.18% in terms of win prediction accuracy. Furthermore,\nCUPID has been successfully deployed in a popular online mobile MOBA game. The\ndeployment resulted in significant improvements in match fairness and player\nsatisfaction, as evidenced by critical Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) metrics\ncovering usability, accessibility, and engagement, observed through A/B\ntesting. To the best of our knowledge, CUPID is the first re-matchmaking system\ndesigned specifically for large-scale MOBA games.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u4eba\u7dda\u4e0a\u6230\u9b25\u7af6\u6280\u5834 (MOBA) \u985e\u578b\u904a\u6232\u7372\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u7684\n\u4eba\u6c23\u548c\u7d93\u6fdf\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5\u793e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u76f8\u7576\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u904a\u6232\u9ad4\u9a57\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u800c MOBA \u904a\u6232\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u9762\u5411\u662f\u914d\u5c0d\uff0c\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u7d44\u6210\u6280\u80fd\u7b49\u7d1a\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u968a\u4f0d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u914d\u5c0d\u7cfb\u7d71\u7d93\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u597d\u548c\u968a\u4f0d\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u73a9\u5bb6\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba CUPID \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5f15\u9032\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba\u300c\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u5c0d\u300d\u7684\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u5718\u968a\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u73a9\u5bb6\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u3002CUPID \u7d50\u5408\u4e00\u500b\u9810\u5148\u904e\u6ffe\u6b65\u9a5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u914d\u5c0d\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u6c34\u6e96\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u9810\u5148\u6bd4\u8cfd\u52dd\u7387\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6f5b\u5728\u5206\u914d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u900f\u904e\u540c\u6642\u8003\u91cf\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u904a\u6232\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0cCUPID \u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u589e\u5f37\u7684\u914d\u5c0d\u9ad4\u9a57\u3002\u5728\u5169\u500b\u5927\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c MOBA \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a57\u8b49 CUPID \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u5728\u7372\u52dd\u9810\u6e2c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5c0d\u63d0\u5347 7.18%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCUPID \u5df2\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u71b1\u9580\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u884c\u52d5 MOBA \u904a\u6232\u4e2d\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u5c0e\u81f4\u6bd4\u8cfd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u73a9\u5bb6\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9019\u7531\u6db5\u84cb\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u53c3\u8207\u5ea6\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5 (HCI) \u6307\u6a19\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e A/B \u6e2c\u8a66\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0cCUPID \u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u9580\u70ba\u5927\u578b MOBA \u904a\u6232\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u5c0d\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002", "author": "Ge Fan et.al.", "authors": "Ge Fan, Chaoyun Zhang, Kai Wang, Yingjie Li, Junyang Chen, Zenglin Xu", "id": "2406.19720v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19720v1", "repo": "null"}}

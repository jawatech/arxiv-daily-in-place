However, our\nunderstanding of the inner workings and conditions of apparition of CoT\ncapabilities remains limited. This paper helps fill this gap by demonstrating\nhow CoT reasoning emerges in transformers in a controlled and interpretable\nsetting. In particular, we observe the appearance of a specialized attention\nmechanism dedicated to iterative reasoning, which we coined \"iteration heads\".\nWe track both the emergence and the precise working of these iteration heads\ndown to the attention level, and measure the transferability of the CoT skills\nto which they give rise between tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u93c8\u5f0f\u601d\u8003 (CoT) \u63a8\u7406\u5df2\u77e5\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u7d93\u9a57\u4e0a\u548c\u7406\u8ad6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7686\u7136\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d CoT \u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5167\u90e8\u904b\u4f5c\u548c\u51fa\u73fe\u689d\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u900f\u904e\u5c55\u793a CoT \u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u51fa\u73fe\u5728 Transformer \u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u586b\u88dc\u6b64\u4e00\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u7a2e\u5c08\u9580\u7528\u65bc\u53cd\u8986\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5176\u7a31\u70ba\u300c\u53cd\u8986\u982d\u300d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8ffd\u8e64\u9019\u4e9b\u53cd\u8986\u982d\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u548c\u7cbe\u78ba\u904b\u4f5c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c64\u7d1a\uff0c\u4e26\u8861\u91cf CoT \u6280\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u52d9\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8f49\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "author": "Vivien Cabannes et.al.", "authors": "Vivien Cabannes, Charles Arnal, Wassim Bouaziz, Alice Yang, Francois Charton, Julia Kempe", "id": "2406.02128v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02128v1", "repo": "null"}}

As a consequence, an agent must know how to\nperform a multitude of tasks. However, when a new task is presented to an\nagent, we expect it to be able to reuse some of what it knows from previous\ntasks to rapidly learn that new task. We introduce a novel technique whereby\npolicies for different a priori known tasks are combined into a\nMixture-of-Experts model with an attention mechanism across a mix of frozen and\nunfrozen experts. The model learns when to attend to frozen task-specific\nexperts when appropriate and learns new experts to handle novel situations. We\nwork in an open-ended text-based environment in which the agent is tasked with\nbehaving like different types of character roles and must rapidly learn\nbehaviors associated with new character role types. We show that our agent both\nobtains more rewards in the zero-shot setting, and discovers these rewards with\ngreater sample efficiency in the few-shot learning settings.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u662f\u6307\u5176\u4e2d\u6c92\u6709\u9810\u5148\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u6216\u74b0\u5883\u734e\u52f5\u4fe1\u865f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5fc5\u9808\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u57f7\u884c\u591a\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7576\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\u5448\u73fe\u7d66\u4ee3\u7406\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u5b83\u80fd\u5920\u91cd\u8907\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u5f9e\u4ee5\u524d\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5feb\u901f\u5b78\u7fd2\u90a3\u500b\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u85c9\u6b64\u5c07\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u9a57\u5df2\u77e5\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7d44\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u51cd\u7d50\u548c\u672a\u51cd\u7d50\u5c08\u5bb6\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u3002\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u9069\u7576\u6642\u6a5f\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u51cd\u7d50\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u5c08\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e26\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b0\u7684\u5c08\u5bb6\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u65b0\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u57fa\u65bc\u6587\u672c\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u8a72\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u88ab\u8ce6\u4e88\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5fc5\u9808\u5feb\u901f\u5b78\u7fd2\u8207\u65b0\u89d2\u8272\u985e\u578b\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u734e\u52f5\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a23\u672c\u6548\u7387\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u734e\u52f5\u3002", "author": "Christopher Z.

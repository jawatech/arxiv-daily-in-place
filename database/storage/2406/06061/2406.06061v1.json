{"2406.06061": {"publish_time": "2024-06-10", "title": "Greedy SLIM: A SLIM-Based Approach For Preference Elicitation", "paper_summary": "Preference elicitation is an active learning approach to tackle the\ncold-start problem of recommender systems. Roughly speaking, new users are\nasked to rate some carefully selected items in order to compute appropriate\nrecommendations for them. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\npropose a method for preference elicitation that is based on SLIM , a\nstate-of-the-art technique for top-N recommendation. Our approach mainly\nconsists of a new training technique for SLIM, which we call Greedy SLIM. This\ntechnique iteratively selects items for the training in order to minimize the\nSLIM loss greedily. We conduct offline experiments as well as a user study to\nassess the performance of this new method. The results are remarkable,\nespecially with respect to the user study. We conclude that Greedy SLIM seems\nto be more suitable for preference elicitation than widely used methods based\non latent factor models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5c0e\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u4e3b\u52d5\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u89e3\u6c7a\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u51b7\u555f\u52d5\u554f\u984c\u3002\u7c97\u7565\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6703\u8981\u6c42\u65b0\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8a55\u5206\u4e00\u4e9b\u7d93\u904e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9078\u7684\u9805\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u70ba\u4ed6\u5011\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u5408\u9069\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u65bc SLIM\uff08\u4e00\u7a2e\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u9802\u5c16\u63a8\u85a6\u6280\u8853\uff09\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5c0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7a2e SLIM \u7684\u65b0\u8a13\u7df4\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u8caa\u5a6a SLIM\u3002\u6b64\u6280\u8853\u6703\u53cd\u8986\u9078\u64c7\u8a13\u7df4\u9805\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u8caa\u5a6a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 SLIM \u640d\u5931\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u96e2\u7dda\u5be6\u9a57\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u6b64\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u975e\u5e38\u986f\u8457\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff0c\u8207\u57fa\u65bc\u6f5b\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8caa\u5a6a SLIM \u4f3c\u4e4e\u66f4\u9069\u5408\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5c0e\u3002", "author": "Claudius Proissl et.al.", "authors": "Claudius Proissl, Amel Vatic, Helmut Waldschmidt", "id": "2406.06061v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06061v1", "repo": "null"}}

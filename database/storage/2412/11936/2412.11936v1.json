As\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) progresses, integrating large language\nmodels (LLMs) with mathematical reasoning tasks is becoming increasingly\nsignificant. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of\nmathematical reasoning in the era of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).\nWe review over 200 studies published since 2021, and examine the\nstate-of-the-art developments in Math-LLMs, with a focus on multimodal\nsettings. We categorize the field into three dimensions: benchmarks,\nmethodologies, and challenges. In particular, we explore multimodal\nmathematical reasoning pipeline, as well as the role of (M)LLMs and the\nassociated methodologies. Finally, we identify five major challenges hindering\nthe realization of AGI in this domain, offering insights into the future\ndirection for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities. This survey serves\nas a critical resource for the research community in advancing the capabilities\nof LLMs to tackle complex multimodal reasoning tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u985e\u8a8d\u77e5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f9e\u6559\u80b2\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u5230\u79d1\u5b78\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u6167 (AGI) \u7684\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u5c07\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8207\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u6574\u5408\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9019\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (MLLM) \u6642\u4ee3\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u81ea 2021 \u5e74\u4ee5\u4f86\u767c\u8868\u7684 200 \u591a\u9805\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u6aa2\u8996\u4e86\u6578\u5b78 LLM \u7684\u6700\u65b0\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u653e\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u5206\u70ba\u4e09\u500b\u9762\u5411\uff1a\u57fa\u6e96\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6311\u6230\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca (M)LLM \u548c\u76f8\u95dc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u627e\u51fa\u963b\u7919\u5728\u9019\u500b\u9818\u57df\u5be6\u73fe AGI \u7684\u4e94\u9805\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c0d\u672a\u4f86\u52a0\u5f37\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u9019\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\u53ef\u4f5c\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u7fa4\u63a8\u9032 LLM \u89e3\u6c7a\u8907\u96dc\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002", "author": "Yibo Yan et.al.", "authors": "Yibo Yan, Jiamin Su, Jianxiang He, Fangteng Fu, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Kun Wang, Shen Wang, Qingsong Wen, Xuming Hu", "id": "2412.11936v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11936v1", "repo": "null"}}

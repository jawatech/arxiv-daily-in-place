In this vision paper, we present our perspectives on how\nAI can better assist scientific inquiry and explore corresponding technical\napproach. We have proposed and open-sourced a large model of our KALE-LM model\nseries, Llama3-KALE-LM-Chem-8B, which has achieved outstanding performance in\ntasks related to the field of chemistry. We hope that our work serves as a\nstrong starting point, helping to realize more intelligent AI and promoting the\nadvancement of human science and technology, as well as societal development.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9010\u6f38\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5176\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528 AI \u4f86\u63a8\u9032\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u5099\u53d7\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u63d0\u51fa\u6211\u5011\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e AI \u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5354\u52a9\u79d1\u5b78\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u76f8\u61c9\u7684\u6280\u8853\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u4e26\u958b\u653e\u539f\u59cb\u78bc\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u6211\u5011 KALE-LM \u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0cLlama3-KALE-LM-Chem-8B\uff0c\u5728\u8207\u5316\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5091\u51fa\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6210\u679c\u80fd\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u5f37\u6709\u529b\u7684\u8d77\u9ede\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u5be6\u73fe\u66f4\u667a\u6167\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff0c\u4e26\u4fc3\u9032\u4eba\u985e\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u6703\u767c\u5c55\u3002", "author": "Weichen Dai et.al.", "authors": "Weichen Dai, Yezeng Chen, Zijie Dai, Zhijie Huang, Yubo Liu, Yixuan Pan, Baiyang Song, Chengli Zhong, Xinhe Li, Zeyu Wang, Zhuoying Feng, Yi Zhou", "id": "2409.18695v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18695v1", "repo": "null"}}

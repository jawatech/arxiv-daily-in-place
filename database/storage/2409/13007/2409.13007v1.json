It is fairly common and requires careful handling to obtain desirable\nperformance. Traditional classification algorithms become biased toward the\nmajority class. One way to alleviate the scenario is to make the classifiers\ncost-sensitive. This is achieved by assigning a higher misclassification cost\nto minority-class instances. One issue with this implementation is that all the\nminority-class instances are treated equally, and assigned with the same\npenalty value. However, the learning difficulties of all the instances are not\nthe same. Instances that are located near the decision boundary are harder to\nclassify, whereas those further away are easier. Without taking into\nconsideration the instance complexity and naively weighting all the\nminority-class samples uniformly, results in an unwarranted bias and\nconsequently, a higher number of misclassifications of the majority-class\ninstances. This is undesirable and to overcome the situation, we propose a\nnovel instance complexity-based cost-sensitive approach in this study. We first\ncategorize all the minority-class instances based on their difficulty level and\nthen the instances are penalized accordingly. This ensures a more equitable\ninstance weighting and prevents excessive penalization. The performance of the\nproposed approach is tested on 66 imbalanced datasets against the traditional\ncost-sensitive learning frameworks and a significant improvement in performance\nis noticeable, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u985e\u5225\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5c0d\u65bc\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u9019\u76f8\u7576\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c0f\u5fc3\u8655\u7406\u624d\u80fd\u7372\u5f97\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u5206\u985e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6703\u504f\u5411\u591a\u6578\u985e\u5225\u3002\u4e00\u7a2e\u7de9\u89e3\u9019\u7a2e\u60c5\u6cc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8b93\u5206\u985e\u5668\u5c0d\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9019\u662f\u900f\u904e\u5c0d\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u6307\u5b9a\u8f03\u9ad8\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u5206\u985e\u6210\u672c\u4f86\u9054\u6210\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u5be6\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u554f\u984c\u662f\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u5e73\u7b49\u5c0d\u5f85\uff0c\u4e26\u6307\u5b9a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u61f2\u7f70\u503c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u96e3\u5ea6\u4e26\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u4f4d\u65bc\u6c7a\u7b56\u908a\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u8f03\u96e3\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u800c\u8f03\u9060\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u5247\u8f03\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u5728\u6c92\u6709\u8003\u616e\u5be6\u4f8b\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u4e26\u5929\u771f\u5730\u5c0d\u6240\u6709\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u6a23\u672c\u9032\u884c\u5747\u52fb\u52a0\u6b0a\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5c0e\u81f4\u5c0d\u591a\u6578\u985e\u5225\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u8aa4\u5206\u985e\u6578\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9019\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u7684\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u7a2e\u60c5\u6cc1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u5be6\u4f8b\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u7684\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u6839\u64da\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u96e3\u5ea6\u7b49\u7d1a\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c0d\u5be6\u4f8b\u9032\u884c\u76f8\u61c9\u7684\u61f2\u7f70\u3002\u9019\u78ba\u4fdd\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u52a0\u6b0a\uff0c\u4e26\u9632\u6b62\u904e\u5ea6\u61f2\u7f70\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5df2\u5728 66 \u500b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u91dd\u5c0d\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\u9032\u884c\u6e2c\u8a66\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6548\u80fd\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "author": "Asif Newaz et.al.", "authors": "Asif Newaz, Asif Ur Rahman Adib, Taskeed Jabid", "id": "2409.13007v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13007v1", "repo": "null"}}

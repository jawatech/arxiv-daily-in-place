Various external factors, such as weather changes and the emergence of\nnew electricity consumption scenarios, can impact electricity demand, causing\nload data to fluctuate and become non-linear, which increases the complexity\nand difficulty of STELF. In the past decade, deep learning has been applied to\nSTELF, modeling and predicting electricity demand with high accuracy, and\ncontributing significantly to the development of STELF. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive survey on deep-learning-based STELF over the past ten years. It\nexamines the entire forecasting process, including data pre-processing, feature\nextraction, deep-learning modeling and optimization, and results evaluation.\nThis paper also identifies some research challenges and potential research\ndirections to be further investigated in future work.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77ed\u671f\u96fb\u529b\u8ca0\u8f09\u9810\u6e2c\uff08STELF\uff09\u662f\u6307\u5c0d\u96fb\u529b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u5e7e\u500b\u5c0f\u6642\u81f3\u6578\u5929\u7684\u5373\u6642\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u9032\u884c\u9810\u6e2c\u3002\u5929\u6c23\u8b8a\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u60c5\u5883\u51fa\u73fe\u7b49\u5404\u7a2e\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u8ca0\u8f09\u6578\u64da\u6ce2\u52d5\u4e26\u8b8a\u5f97\u975e\u7dda\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u589e\u52a0\u4e86 STELF \u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u548c\u96e3\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5df2\u61c9\u7528\u65bc STELF\uff0c\u5c0d\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba STELF \u7684\u767c\u5c55\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u8ca2\u737b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c0d\u904e\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u57fa\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684 STELF \u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u5b83\u5be9\u67e5\u4e86\u6574\u500b\u9810\u6e2c\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6578\u64da\u9810\u8655\u7406\u3001\u7279\u5fb5\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u512a\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u7d50\u679c\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9084\u78ba\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6230\u548c\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "author": "Qi Dong et.al.", "authors": "Qi Dong, Rubing Huang, Chenhui Cui, Dave Towey, Ling Zhou, Jinyu Tian, Jianzhou Wang", "id": "2408.16202v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16202v1", "repo": "null"}}

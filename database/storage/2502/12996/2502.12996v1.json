These methods split updates into two parts: an inner\noptimization phase, where the workers independently execute multiple\noptimization steps on their own local data, and an outer optimization step,\nwhere the inner updates are synchronized. While such approaches require orders\nof magnitude less communication than standard data-parallel training, in\nsettings where the workers are datacenters, even the limited communication\nrequirements of these approaches can still cause significant slow downs due to\nthe blocking necessary at each outer optimization step. In this paper, we\ninvestigate techniques to mitigate this issue by overlapping communication with\ncomputation in a manner that allows the outer optimization step to fully\noverlap with the inner optimization phase. We show that a particular variant,\ndubbed eager updates, provides competitive performance with standard DiLoCo in\nsettings with low bandwidth between workers.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u512a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 DiLoCo\uff09\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8a13\u7df4\u6a6b\u8de8\u591a\u500b\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c07\u66f4\u65b0\u62c6\u5206\u70ba\u5169\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u5167\u90e8\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7368\u7acb\u5730\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u672c\u5730\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\u591a\u500b\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6b65\u9a5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6b65\u9a5f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5167\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u6703\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u6b64\u985e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u901a\u8a0a\u91cf\u6bd4\u6a19\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u5e73\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u5c11\u5e7e\u500b\u6578\u91cf\u7d1a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u70ba\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\u7684\u901a\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u65bc\u6bcf\u500b\u5916\u90e8\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6b65\u9a5f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c01\u9396\u800c\u5c0e\u81f4\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6e1b\u901f\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u900f\u904e\u4ee5\u5141\u8a31\u5916\u90e8\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6b65\u9a5f\u8207\u5167\u90e8\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u968e\u6bb5\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u758a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c07\u901a\u8a0a\u8207\u904b\u7b97\u91cd\u758a\uff0c\u4f86\u6e1b\u8f15\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7279\u5b9a\u8b8a\u9ad4\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u5373\u6642\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4e4b\u9593\u983b\u5bec\u8f03\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u8207\u6a19\u6e96 DiLoCo \u76f8\u7576\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Satyen Kale et.al.", "authors": "Satyen Kale, Arthur Douillard, Yanislav Donchev", "id": "2502.12996v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12996v1", "repo": "null"}}

We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel\napproach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs\na Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) for simulating the dynamics of\nthe generator. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based\nmethods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that\npreserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also\npropose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability\nin black-box attacks by effectively tuning noise parameters during training.\nExperiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more\neffective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while\npreserving better perceptual quality than traditional GAN-based methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e86\u89e3\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5c0d\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u96e3\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89ba\u7684\u64fe\u52d5\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a19\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u904e\u79fb\u9664\u5176\u5947\u7570\u6027\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u66f4\u7a69\u5065\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 NODE-AdvGAN\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u751f\u6210\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e26\u63a1\u7528\u795e\u7d93\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f (NODE) \u4f86\u6a21\u64ec\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u6a21\u4eff\u50b3\u7d71\u57fa\u65bc\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNODE-AdvGAN \u7522\u751f\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u66f4\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u64fe\u52d5\uff0c\u5728\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u826f\u6027\u5f71\u50cf\u6642\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u7b56\u7565 NODE-AdvGAN-T\uff0c\u5b83\u900f\u904e\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8abf\u6574\u96dc\u8a0a\u53c3\u6578\uff0c\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u64ca\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u50b3\u905e\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\uff0cNODE-AdvGAN \u548c NODE-AdvGAN-T \u7522\u751f\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6bd4\u50b3\u7d71\u57fa\u65bc GAN \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "author": "Xinheng Xie et.al.", "authors": "Xinheng Xie, Yue Wu, Cuiyu He", "id": "2412.03539v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03539v1", "repo": "null"}}

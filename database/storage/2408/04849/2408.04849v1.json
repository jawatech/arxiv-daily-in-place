This paper introduces a new ensemble\nlearning network based on BERT, employing the concept of enhancing model\nperformance by integrating multiple classifiers. We trained a range of\nBERT-based learners, which combined using the majority voting method. We\ncollect social network text data of middle school students through China's\nWeibo and apply the method to the task of classifying emotional tendencies in\nmiddle school students' social network texts. Experimental results suggest that\nthe ensemble learning network has a better performance than the base model and\nthe performance of the ensemble learning model, consisting of three\nsingle-layer BERT models, is barely the same as a three-layer BERT model but\nrequires 11.58% more training time. Therefore, in terms of balancing prediction\neffect and efficiency, the deeper BERT network should be preferred for\ntraining. However, for interpretability, network ensembles can provide\nacceptable solutions.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e2d\u5b78\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8a55\u4f30\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6559\u80b2\u9818\u57df\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\u91cd\u9ede\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc BERT \u7684\u65b0\u96c6\u6210\u5b78\u7fd2\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u6574\u5408\u591a\u500b\u5206\u985e\u5668\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4f86\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a13\u7df4\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u65bc BERT \u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u5668\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6578\u6c7a\u6295\u7968\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u4e2d\u570b\u5fae\u535a\u6536\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8def\u6587\u5b57\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\u5b78\u751f\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8def\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u50be\u5411\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b78\u7fd2\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u512a\u65bc\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e09\u500b\u55ae\u5c64 BERT \u6a21\u578b\u7d44\u6210\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u8207\u4e09\u5c64 BERT \u6a21\u578b\u5e7e\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u537b\u591a\u4e86 11.58%\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u9810\u6e2c\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u61c9\u512a\u5148\u8003\u616e\u8f03\u6df1\u7684 BERT \u7db2\u8def\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u7db2\u8def\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "author": "Kai Jiang et.al.", "authors": "Kai Jiang, Honghao Yang, Yuexian Wang, Qianru Chen, Yiming Luo", "id": "2408.04849v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04849v1", "repo": "null"}}

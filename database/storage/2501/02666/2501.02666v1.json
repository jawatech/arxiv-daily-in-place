Recently, Graph Neural\nNetworks-based micro-video recommendation has displayed performance improvement\nfor many kinds of recommendation tasks. However, the existing works fail to\nfully consider the characteristics of micro-videos, such as the high timeliness\nof news nature micro-video recommendation and sequential interactions of\nfrequently changed interests. In this paper, a novel Multi-aggregator\nTime-warping Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MTHGNN) is proposed for\npersonalized news nature micro-video recommendation based on sequential\nsessions, where characteristics of micro-videos are comprehensively studied,\nusers' preference is mined via multi-aggregator, the temporal and dynamic\nchanges of users' preference are captured, and timeliness is considered.\nThrough the comparison with the state-of-the-arts, the experimental results\nvalidate the superiority of our MTHGNN model.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u63a8\u85a6\u6b63\u5438\u5f15\u5168\u7403\u95dc\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e26\u6210\u70ba\u5404\u5e74\u9f61\u5c64\u6c11\u773e\u7684\u71b1\u9580\u65e5\u5e38\u670d\u52d9\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u63a8\u85a6\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u63a8\u85a6\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u4e86\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u91cf\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u65b0\u805e\u6027\u8cea\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u63a8\u85a6\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6642\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u983b\u7e41\u8b8a\u52d5\u8208\u8da3\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e92\u52d5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u591a\u805a\u5408\u5668\u6642\u5e8f\u8b8a\u5f62\u7570\u8cea\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff08MTHGNN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc\u5e8f\u5217\u5f0f\u700f\u89bd\u8a18\u9304\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u65b0\u805e\u6027\u8cea\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u63a8\u85a6\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u8a0e\u5fae\u5f71\u7247\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u591a\u805a\u5408\u5668\u6316\u6398\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6642\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4e26\u8003\u91cf\u6642\u6548\u6027\u3002\u900f\u904e\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u6280\u8853\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6211\u5011 MTHGNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u512a\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "author": "Jinkun Han et.al.", "authors": "Jinkun Han, Wei Li, Xhipeng Cai, Yingshu Li", "id": "2501.02666v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02666v1", "repo": "null"}}

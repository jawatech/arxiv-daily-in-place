In this context,\nmodes of expression are seen as a factor towards the automatic analysis of\ncomplexity in texts.\n  Experiments on French texts show acceptable results compared to the human\nannotators' agreement, and outperforming results compared to using a large\nlanguage model with in-context learning (i.e. no fine-tuning).", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u9884\u6d4b (A) \u4e66\u9762\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u5426\u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\uff0c(B) \u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c(C) \u60c5\u611f\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u8fd8\u662f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca (D) \u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1a\u60c5\u611f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1a\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u8bcd\u8bed\u5316\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5230\u66f4\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u53ea\u4f1a\u5f97\u5230\u6697\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd NLP \u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8003\u8651\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u4e4b\u5904\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u662f\u4e66\u9762\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u5e38\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6cd5\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5373\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "author": "Aline \u00c9tienne et.al.", "authors": "Aline \u00c9tienne, Delphine Battistelli, Gw\u00e9nol\u00e9 Lecorv\u00e9", "id": "2405.14385v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14385v1", "repo": "null"}}

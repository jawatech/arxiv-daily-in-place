Sometimes, MRI is preferred to contour\nthe target volumes. However, this approach is often not the most efficient, as\nit is more expensive, time-consuming and, most importantly, stressful for the\npatients. To overcome this issue, in this work, we analyse the capabilities of\ndifferent configurations of Deep Learning models to generate synthetic CT scans\nfrom MRI, leveraging the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and,\nin particular, the CycleGAN architecture, capable of working in an unsupervised\nmanner and without paired images, which were not available. Several CycleGAN\nmodels were trained unsupervised to generate CT scans from different MRI\nmodalities with and without contrast agents. To overcome the problem of not\nhaving a ground truth, distribution-based metrics were used to assess the\nmodel's performance quantitatively, together with a qualitative evaluation\nwhere physicians were asked to differentiate between real and synthetic images\nto understand how realistic the generated images were. The results show how,\ndepending on the input modalities, the models can have very different\nperformances; however, models with the best quantitative results, according to\nthe distribution-based metrics used, can generate very difficult images to\ndistinguish from the real ones, even for physicians, demonstrating the\napproach's potential.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u81e8\u5e8a\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u96fb\u8166\u65b7\u5c64\u6383\u63cf (CT) \u548c\u78c1\u632f\u9020\u5f71 (MRI) \u4f86\u5fb9\u5e95\u4e86\u89e3\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u4e26\u898f\u5283\u9069\u7576\u7684\u6cbb\u7642\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u9019\u901a\u5e38\u767c\u751f\u5728\u57fa\u65bc MRI \u7684\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7642\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d CT \u5c0d\u65bc\u6e96\u5099\u5291\u91cf\u50b3\u905e\u7e3d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u95dc\u7d44\u7e54\u8f3b\u5c04\u5438\u6536\u7279\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6709\u6642\uff0cMRI \u512a\u5148\u65bc\u52fe\u52d2\u76ee\u6a19\u9ad4\u7a4d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u66f4\u6602\u8cb4\u3001\u8017\u6642\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u6703\u8b93\u60a3\u8005\u611f\u5230\u58d3\u529b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e MRI \u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210 CT \u6383\u63cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5c0d\u6297\u7db2\u8def (GAN) \u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f CycleGAN \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u4ee5\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6210\u5c0d\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u5f71\u50cf\u4e26\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5e7e\u500b CycleGAN \u6a21\u578b\u7d93\u904e\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c MRI \u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210 CT \u6383\u63cf\uff0c\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5291\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u6c92\u6709\u57fa\u672c\u4e8b\u5be6\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5206\u4f48\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u5b9a\u91cf\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8981\u6c42\u91ab\u751f\u5340\u5206\u771f\u5be6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u6709\u591a\u903c\u771f\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u8f38\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u5206\u4f48\u7684\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u5b9a\u91cf\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u975e\u5e38\u96e3\u4ee5\u8207\u771f\u5be6\u5f71\u50cf\u5340\u5206\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0d\u65bc\u91ab\u751f\u4f86\u8aaa\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u9019\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002", "author": "Leonardo Crespi et.al.", "authors": "Leonardo Crespi, Samuele Camnasio, Damiano Dei, Nicola Lambri, Pietro Mancosu, Marta Scorsetti, Daniele Loiacono", "id": "2407.10888v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10888v1", "repo": "null"}}

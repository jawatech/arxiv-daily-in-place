Our framework leverages the\ngeneric knowledge of LLMs through a small number of prompts to perform\nhigh-level task anticipation, using the anticipated tasks as goals in a\nclassical planning system to compute a sequence of finer-granularity actions\nthat jointly achieve these goals. We ground and evaluate our framework's\nabilities in realistic scenarios in the VirtualHome environment and demonstrate\na 31% reduction in execution time compared with a system that does not consider\nupcoming tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5354\u52a9\u4ee3\u7406\u57f7\u884c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e8b\u52d9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6574\u7406\u5e8a\u92ea\u6216\u88fd\u4f5c\u65e9\u9910\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u8a08\u7b97\u4e26\u57f7\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u9810\u671f\u5373\u5c07\u5230\u4f86\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4e26\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u52d5\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4f86\u5171\u540c\u9054\u6210\u9019\u4e9b\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u9810\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u6df1\u5ea6\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u968e\u4efb\u52d9\u5c64\u9762\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8a31\u591a\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u900f\u904e\u5c11\u6578\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528 LLM \u7684\u4e00\u822c\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u57f7\u884c\u9ad8\u968e\u4efb\u52d9\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u9810\u671f\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u4f5c\u70ba\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u5728\u7d93\u5178\u898f\u5283\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u66f4\u7d30\u7dfb\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5171\u540c\u9054\u6210\u9019\u4e9b\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 VirtualHome \u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u5be6\u969b\u60c5\u6cc1\u9a57\u8b49\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u6211\u5011\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u8207\u4e0d\u8003\u616e\u5373\u5c07\u5230\u4f86\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u57f7\u884c\u6642\u9593\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e86 31%\u3002", "author": "Raghav Arora et.al.", "authors": "Raghav Arora, Shivam Singh, Karthik Swaminathan, Ahana Datta, Snehasis Banerjee, Brojeshwar Bhowmick, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Mohan Sridharan, Madhava Krishna", "id": "2502.02066v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02066v1", "repo": "null"}}

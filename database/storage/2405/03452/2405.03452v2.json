At the individual\nlevel, the accuracy of the out of sample predictions lie in the range 69%-76%\nand are significantly better at predicting the preferences of liberal and\ncollege educated participants. At the population level, we aggregate\npreferences using an adaptation of the Borda score and compare the ranking of\npolicy proposals obtained from a probabilistic sample of participants and from\ndata augmented using LLMs. We find that the augmented data predicts the\npreferences of the full population of participants better than probabilistic\nsamples alone when these represent less than 30% to 40% of the total\npopulation. These results indicate that LLMs are potentially useful for the\nconstruction of systems of augmented democracy.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jairo Gudi\u00f1o-Rosero et.al.", "authors": "Jairo Gudi\u00f1o-Rosero,Umberto Grandi,C\u00e9sar A.

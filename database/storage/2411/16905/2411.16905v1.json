{"2411.16905": {"publish_time": "2024-11-25", "title": "Boundless Socratic Learning with Language Games", "paper_summary": "An agent trained within a closed system can master any desired capability, as\nlong as the following three conditions hold: (a) it receives sufficiently\ninformative and aligned feedback, (b) its coverage of experience/data is broad\nenough, and (c) it has sufficient capacity and resource. In this position\npaper, we justify these conditions, and consider what limitations arise from\n(a) and (b) in closed systems, when assuming that (c) is not a bottleneck.\nConsidering the special case of agents with matching input and output spaces\n(namely, language), we argue that such pure recursive self-improvement, dubbed\n\"Socratic learning\", can boost performance vastly beyond what is present in its\ninitial data or knowledge, and is only limited by time, as well as gradual\nmisalignment concerns. Furthermore, we propose a constructive framework to\nimplement it, based on the notion of language games.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u5c01\u9589\u7cfb\u7d71\u5167\u8a13\u7df4\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u7b26\u5408\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u500b\u689d\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u4efb\u4f55\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff1a(a) \u63a5\u6536\u5145\u5206\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56de\u994b\uff0c(b) \u7d93\u9a57/\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u6db5\u84cb\u7bc4\u570d\u5920\u5ee3\uff0c(c) \u64c1\u6709\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6703\u8aaa\u660e\u9019\u4e9b\u689d\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e26\u601d\u8003\u5728\u5047\u8a2d (c) \u4e0d\u662f\u74f6\u9838\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c01\u9589\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684 (a) \u548c (b) \u6703\u7522\u751f\u4ec0\u9ebc\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8003\u91cf\u8f38\u5165\u548c\u8f38\u51fa\u7a7a\u9593\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff08\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8a9e\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u6cc1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e3b\u5f35\u9019\u7a2e\u7d14\u7cb9\u7684\u905e\u8ff4\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u300c\u8607\u683c\u62c9\u5e95\u5b78\u7fd2\u6cd5\u300d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u9060\u9060\u8d85\u51fa\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u8cc7\u6599\u6216\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u50c5\u53d7\u9650\u65bc\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9010\u6f38\u5931\u8861\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u5efa\u69cb\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u5be6\u4f5c\u5b83\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u8a9e\u8a00\u904a\u6232\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "author": "Tom Schaul et.al.", "authors": "Tom Schaul", "id": "2411.16905v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16905v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2407.01919": {"publish_time": "2024-07-02", "title": "A Method to Facilitate Membership Inference Attacks in Deep Learning Models", "paper_summary": "Modern machine learning (ML) ecosystems offer a surging number of ML\nframeworks and code repositories that can greatly facilitate the development of\nML models. Today, even ordinary data holders who are not ML experts can apply\noff-the-shelf codebase to build high-performance ML models on their data, many\nof which are sensitive in nature (e.g., clinical records).\n  In this work, we consider a malicious ML provider who supplies model-training\ncode to the data holders, does not have access to the training process, and has\nonly black-box query access to the resulting model. In this setting, we\ndemonstrate a new form of membership inference attack that is strictly more\npowerful than prior art. Our attack empowers the adversary to reliably\nde-identify all the training samples (average >99% attack TPR@0.1% FPR), and\nthe compromised models still maintain competitive performance as their\nuncorrupted counterparts (average <1% accuracy drop). Moreover, we show that\nthe poisoned models can effectively disguise the amplified membership leakage\nunder common membership privacy auditing, which can only be revealed by a set\nof secret samples known by the adversary.\n  Overall, our study not only points to the worst-case membership privacy\nleakage, but also unveils a common pitfall underlying existing privacy auditing\nmethods, which calls for future efforts to rethink the current practice of\nauditing membership privacy in machine learning models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684 ML \u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u5132\u5b58\u5eab\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6975\u5927\u5730\u4fc3\u9032 ML \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u958b\u767c\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u662f ML \u5c08\u5bb6\u7684\u666e\u901a\u8cc7\u6599\u6301\u6709\u8005\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5957\u7528\u73fe\u6210\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u5eab\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u5176\u8cc7\u6599\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd ML \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8a31\u591a\u8cc7\u6599\u672c\u8cea\u4e0a\u5f88\u654f\u611f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\u81e8\u5e8a\u7d00\u9304\uff09\u3002\n  \u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8003\u616e\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u60e1\u610f\u7684 ML \u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u5411\u8cc7\u6599\u6301\u6709\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u5b58\u53d6\u8a13\u7df4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u900f\u904e\u9ed1\u76d2\u5b50\u67e5\u8a62\u5b58\u53d6\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u6210\u54e1\u63a8\u8ad6\u653b\u64ca\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6280\u8853\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u8b93\u5c0d\u624b\u80fd\u5920\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u53d6\u6d88\u8b58\u5225\u6240\u6709\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff08\u5e73\u5747 >99% \u653b\u64ca TPR@0.1% FPR\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53d7\u640d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u8207\u672a\u53d7\u640d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u529b\uff08\u5e73\u5747 <1% \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u96b1\u85cf\u5728\u5e38\u898b\u6210\u54e1\u96b1\u79c1\u7a3d\u6838\u4e0b\u7684\u64f4\u589e\u6210\u54e1\u6d29\u6f0f\uff0c\u9019\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u5c0d\u624b\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u7bc4\u4f8b\u96c6\u63ed\u9732\u3002\n  \u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u50c5\u6307\u51fa\u6700\u58de\u60c5\u6cc1\u7684\u6210\u54e1\u96b1\u79c1\u6d29\u6f0f\uff0c\u9084\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73fe\u6709\u96b1\u79c1\u7a3d\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u5e38\u898b\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u9019\u9700\u8981\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u4f86\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7a3d\u6838\u6210\u54e1\u96b1\u79c1\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Zitao Chen et.al.", "authors": "Zitao Chen, Karthik Pattabiraman", "id": "2407.01919v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01919v1", "repo": "null"}}

This paper introduces a novel dataset, Fair-Speech, a\npublicly released corpus to help researchers evaluate their ASR models for\naccuracy across a diverse set of self-reported demographic information, such as\nage, gender, ethnicity, geographic variation and whether the participants\nconsider themselves native English speakers. Our dataset includes approximately\n26.5K utterances in recorded speech by 593 people in the United States, who\nwere paid to record and submit audios of themselves saying voice commands. We\nalso provide ASR baselines, including on models trained on transcribed and\nuntranscribed social media videos and open source models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58 (ASR) \u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u4e0d\u7279\u5225\u95dc\u6ce8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7d71\u8a08\u7fa4\u7d44\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 Fair-Speech\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u516c\u958b\u767c\u5e03\u7684\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\uff0c\u5354\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u8a55\u4f30\u5176 ASR \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u81ea\u6211\u5831\u544a\u4eba\u53e3\u7d71\u8a08\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5e74\u9f61\u3001\u6027\u5225\u3001\u7a2e\u65cf\u3001\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u662f\u5426\u8a8d\u70ba\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u82f1\u8a9e\u6bcd\u8a9e\u4eba\u58eb\uff09\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u7f8e\u570b 593 \u4eba\u9304\u88fd\u7684\u8a9e\u97f3\uff0c\u7d04 26.5K \u500b\u8a9e\u53e5\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u4eba\u53d7\u96c7\u9304\u88fd\u4e26\u63d0\u4ea4\u4ed6\u5011\u8aaa\u51fa\u8a9e\u97f3\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u97f3\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u63d0\u4f9b ASR \u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u8f49\u9304\u548c\u672a\u8f49\u9304\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u5f71\u7247\u4ee5\u53ca\u958b\u653e\u539f\u59cb\u78bc\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Irina-Elena Veliche et.al.", "authors": "Irina-Elena Veliche, Zhuangqun Huang, Vineeth Ayyat Kochaniyan, Fuchun Peng, Ozlem Kalinli, Michael L.

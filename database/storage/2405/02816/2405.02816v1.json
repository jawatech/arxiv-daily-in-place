Stochastic RAG casts the retrieval process in RAG as a\nstochastic sampling without replacement process. Through this formulation, we\nemploy straight-through Gumbel-top-k that provides a differentiable\napproximation for sampling without replacement and enables effective end-to-end\noptimization for RAG. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse\ndatasets on a wide range of tasks, from open-domain question answering to fact\nverification to slot-filling for relation extraction and to dialogue systems.\nBy applying this optimization method to a recent and effective RAG model, we\nadvance state-of-the-art results on six out of seven datasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Hamed Zamani et.al.", "authors": "Hamed Zamani,Michael Bendersky", "id": "2405.02816v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02816v1", "repo": "null"}}

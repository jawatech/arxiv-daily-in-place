To bridge the gap between the traditional and computerized\nproof, my approach to formalizing theorem proving involves generating formal\nsteps and complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural\nLanguage (NL) proofs. The method is to introduce the basic structure and\ntactics in general, determine how AI can assist the mathematical formalization\nprocess to improve its performance, and give examples of solving problems in\nLean 4 comparing to NL, mainly in IMO, and a sample theorem proving in abstract\nalgebra.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4f7f\u7528 Lean 4 \u7b49\u53ef\u8a08\u7b97\u9a57\u8b49\u5f62\u5f0f\u8a9e\u8a00\u4f86\u8b49\u660e\u6578\u5b78\u5b9a\u7406\u5c0d\u6578\u5b78\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\nLean 4 \u70ba\u63a8\u9032\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u50c5\u9650\u65bc\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5728\u7dda\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u81f4\u529b\u65bc\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5f4c\u5408\u50b3\u7d71\u548c\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u5316\u8b49\u660e\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5c0d\u5b9a\u7406\u8b49\u660e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00 (NL) \u8b49\u660e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b65\u9a5f\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u8b49\u660e\u7684\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\u3002\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7d50\u69cb\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u78ba\u5b9a AI \u5982\u4f55\u5354\u52a9\u6578\u5b78\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u904e\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e26\u7d66\u51fa\u5728 Lean 4 \u4e2d\u89e3\u6c7a\u554f\u984c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8207 NL \u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728 IMO \u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee3\u6578\u4e2d\u7684\u6a23\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\u8b49\u660e\u3002", "author": "Xichen Tang et.al.", "authors": "Xichen Tang", "id": "2409.05977v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05977v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, less investment is conducted\nin aligning translations with human preferences, such as translation tones or\nstyles. In this paper, a new method is proposed to effectively generate\nlarge-scale multilingual parallel corpora with specific translation preferences\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, an automatic pipeline is\ndesigned to distill human preferences into smaller Machine Translation (MT)\nmodels for efficiently and economically supporting large-scale calls in online\nservices. Experiments indicate that the proposed method takes the lead in\ntranslation tasks with aligned human preferences by a large margin. Meanwhile,\non popular public benchmarks like WMT and Flores, on which our models were not\ntrained, the proposed method also shows a competitive performance compared to\nSOTA works.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7ffb\u8b6f\u5c0d\u65bc\u8de8\u8a9e\u8a00\u6e9d\u901a\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u52aa\u529b\u90fd\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8b6f\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u8abf\u6574\u7ffb\u8b6f\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u504f\u597d\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7ffb\u8b6f\u8a9e\u6c23\u6216\u98a8\u683c\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u6295\u5165\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\u8f03\u5c11\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6709\u6548\u7522\u751f\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ffb\u8b6f\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u5e73\u884c\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c07\u4eba\u985e\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u7149\u5230\u8f03\u5c0f\u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f (MT) \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d93\u6fdf\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u652f\u63f4\u7dda\u4e0a\u670d\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u547c\u53eb\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u7ffb\u8b6f\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u9818\u5148\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u53d7\u904e\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u71b1\u9580\u516c\u958b\u57fa\u6e96\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 WMT \u548c Flores\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u8207 SOTA \u4f5c\u54c1\u76f8\u5339\u6575\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Shuqiao Sun et.al.", "authors": "Shuqiao Sun, Yutong Yao, Peiwen Wu, Feijun Jiang, Kaifu Zhang", "id": "2410.11410v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11410v1", "repo": "null"}}

The relationship\nbetween marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is\na recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can\naccurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension\nreduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts\ntime-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among\nfMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of\nthe inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset\nof 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction\nConnectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain\nconnections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A\nGraph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification\ntask, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize\nintricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for\nfMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a\nfive-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the\ncorrelation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard\ndeviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%,\nwith a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of\nknowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the\nnecessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity\nanalysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u73fe\u4eca\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u64f4\u589e Granger \u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2 (lsAGC) \u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\u5927\u8166\u7db2\u8def\u9023\u7d50\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u6aa2\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u975c\u614b\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u78c1\u632f\u9020\u5f71 (fMRI) \u5340\u5206\u5927\u9ebb\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u548c\u5178\u578b\u5c0d\u7167\u7d44\u3002\u5927\u9ebb\u4f7f\u7528\u8207\u5927\u8166\u7db2\u8def\u9023\u7d50\u6027\u6539\u8b8a\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u662f\u79d1\u5b78\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u516c\u8a8d\u7684\u4e8b\u5be6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e lsAGC \u5982\u4f55\u6e96\u78ba\u8fa8\u5225\u9019\u4e9b\u6539\u8b8a\u3002\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6280\u8853\u5c07\u7dad\u5ea6\u7c21\u7d04\u8207\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f86\u6e90\u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u64f4\u5145\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u4f30\u8a08 fMRI \u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u591a\u8b8a\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0clsAGC \u5728\u8003\u91cf\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u540c\u6642\u63ed\u793a\u56fa\u6709\u52d5\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u9023\u7d50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f9e\u6210\u766e\u9023\u63a5\u7d44\u524d\u8655\u7406\u8a08\u756b (ACPI) \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684 60 \u4f4d\u5728\u7ae5\u5e74\u6642\u671f\u88ab\u8a3a\u65b7\u51fa\u60a3\u6709 ADHD \u7684\u6210\u4eba\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u3002\u7531 lsAGC \u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u5927\u8166\u9023\u7d50\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5206\u985e\u5c6c\u6027\u3002\u5716\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GAT) \u88ab\u9078\u4f86\u57f7\u884c\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5177\u5099\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u5716\u5f62\u7684\u6578\u64da\u548c\u8fa8\u8b58\u5927\u8166\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u9593\u8907\u96dc\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc fMRI \u7684\u5927\u8166\u9023\u7d50\u6027\u6578\u64da\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u500d\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a57\u8b49\u7cfb\u7d71\u5206\u6790\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u76f8\u95dc\u4fc2\u6578\u6cd5\u9054\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u7d04\u70ba 52.98%\uff0c\u6a19\u6e96\u5dee\u70ba 1.65\uff0c\u800c lsAGC \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u70ba 61.47%\uff0c\u6a19\u6e96\u5dee\u70ba 1.44\u3002\u5efa\u8b70\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u795e\u7d93\u5f71\u50cf\u5b78\u7684\u5206\u985e\u9818\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u9ad4\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u9ebb\u5c0d\u5927\u8166\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u6642\uff0c\u5728\u8166\u7db2\u8def\u9023\u7d50\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8003\u91cf\u5b9a\u5411\u56e0\u679c\u9023\u7d50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Ali Vosoughi et.al.", "authors": "Ali Vosoughi, Akhil Kasturi, Axel Wismueller", "id": "2410.18506v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18506v1", "repo": "null"}}

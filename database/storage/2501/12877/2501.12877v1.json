{"2501.12877": {"publish_time": "2025-01-22", "title": "WisdomBot: Tuning Large Language Models with Artificial Intelligence Knowledge", "paper_summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), showing a promising future of artificial generated\nintelligence (AGI). Despite their notable performance in the general domain,\nLLMs have remained suboptimal in the field of education, owing to the unique\nchallenges presented by this domain, such as the need for more specialized\nknowledge, the requirement for personalized learning experiences, and the\nnecessity for concise explanations of complex concepts. To address these\nissues, this paper presents a novel LLM for education named WisdomBot, which\ncombines the power of LLMs with educational theories, enabling their seamless\nintegration into educational contexts. To be specific, we harness\nself-instructed knowledge concepts and instructions under the guidance of\nBloom's Taxonomy as training data. To further enhance the accuracy and\nprofessionalism of model's response on factual questions, we introduce two key\nenhancements during inference, i.e., local knowledge base retrieval\naugmentation and search engine retrieval augmentation during inference. We\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several\nChinese LLMs, thereby showcasing that the fine-tuned models can generate more\nreliable and professional responses.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08AGI\uff09\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u524d\u666f\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u9818\u57df\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4f46 LLM \u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9818\u57df\u4ecd\u672a\u9054\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u72c0\u614b\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7368\u7279\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\u3001\u500b\u6027\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u9ad4\u9a57\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u8907\u96dc\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7c21\u6f54\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba WisdomBot \u7684\u6559\u80b2 LLM\uff0c\u5b83\u7d50\u5408\u4e86 LLM \u7684\u529b\u91cf\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8ad6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5920\u7121\u7e2b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6559\u80b2\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u9b6f\u59c6\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8aaa\u660e\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u4e8b\u5be6\u554f\u984c\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5169\u9805\u95dc\u9375\u7684\u6539\u9032\uff0c\u5373\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u5eab\u6aa2\u7d22\u64f4\u5145\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u6aa2\u7d22\u64f4\u5145\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5c07\u5176\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5e7e\u500b\u4e2d\u6587 LLM \u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5c55\u793a\u5fae\u8abf\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u3002", "author": "Jingyuan Chen et.al.", "authors": "Jingyuan Chen, Tao Wu, Wei Ji, Fei Wu", "id": "2501.12877v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12877v1", "repo": "null"}}

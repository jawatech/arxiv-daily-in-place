Recent studies on these systems\nhave considered various types of information such as images and texts. However,\nmultimodal data have not yet been utilized directly to recommend products to\nusers. In this study, we propose an attention-based sequential recommendation\nmethod that employs multimodal data of items such as images, texts, and\ncategories. First, we extract image and text features from pre-trained VGG and\nBERT and convert categories into multi-labeled forms. Subsequently, attention\noperations are performed independent of the item sequence and multimodal\nrepresentations. Finally, the individual attention information is integrated\nthrough an attention fusion function. In addition, we apply multitask learning\nloss for each modality to improve the generalization performance. The\nexperimental results obtained from the Amazon datasets show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms those of conventional sequential recommendation systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63a1\u7528\u6839\u64da\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u904e\u5f80\u884c\u70ba\u5efa\u6a21\u52d5\u614b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u96fb\u5b50\u5546\u52d9\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u91dd\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u616e\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u8a0a\u985e\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5716\u7247\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8cc7\u6599\u5c1a\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u65bc\u5411\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63a8\u85a6\u7522\u54c1\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u85a6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u9805\u76ee\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5716\u7247\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u548c\u985e\u5225\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 VGG \u548c BERT \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5716\u7247\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u985e\u5225\u8f49\u63db\u6210\u591a\u6a19\u7c64\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u904b\u7b97\u7368\u7acb\u65bc\u9805\u76ee\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8868\u793a\u9032\u884c\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u51fd\u6578\u6574\u5408\u500b\u5225\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u6bcf\u500b\u6a21\u614b\u5957\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u5b78\u7fd2\u640d\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5f9e Amazon \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002", "author": "Hyungtaik Oh et.al.", "authors": "Hyungtaik Oh, Wonkeun Jo, Dongil Kim", "id": "2405.17959v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17959v1", "repo": "null"}}

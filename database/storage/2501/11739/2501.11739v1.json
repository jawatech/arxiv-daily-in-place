{"2501.11739": {"publish_time": "2025-01-20", "title": "Episodic memory in AI agents poses risks that should be studied and mitigated", "paper_summary": "Most current AI models have little ability to store and later retrieve a\nrecord or representation of what they do. In human cognition, episodic memories\nplay an important role in both recall of the past as well as planning for the\nfuture. The ability to form and use episodic memories would similarly enable a\nbroad range of improved capabilities in an AI agent that interacts with and\ntakes actions in the world. Researchers have begun directing more attention to\ndeveloping memory abilities in AI models. It is therefore likely that models\nwith such capability will be become widespread in the near future. This could\nin some ways contribute to making such AI agents safer by enabling users to\nbetter monitor, understand, and control their actions. However, as a new\ncapability with wide applications, we argue that it will also introduce\nsignificant new risks that researchers should begin to study and address. We\noutline these risks and benefits and propose four principles to guide the\ndevelopment of episodic memory capabilities so that these will enhance, rather\nthan undermine, the effort to keep AI safe and trustworthy.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u4eca\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7684 AI \u6a21\u578b\u5e7e\u4e4e\u6c92\u6709\u5132\u5b58\u548c\u7a0d\u5f8c\u6aa2\u7d22\u5176\u57f7\u884c\u7d00\u9304\u6216\u8868\u5fb5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u8a8d\u77e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u7bc0\u8a18\u61b6\u5728\u56de\u61b6\u904e\u53bb\u4ee5\u53ca\u898f\u5283\u672a\u4f86\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u7bc0\u8a18\u61b6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c07\u540c\u6a23\u4f7f\u8207\u4e16\u754c\u4e92\u52d5\u548c\u63a1\u53d6\u884c\u52d5\u7684 AI \u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5177\u5099\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5df2\u958b\u59cb\u5c07\u66f4\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u653e\u5728\u767c\u5c55 AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5177\u5099\u6b64\u985e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u4e0d\u4e45\u7684\u5c07\u4f86\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u9019\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u900f\u904e\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u5b8c\u5584\u5730\u76e3\u63a7\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u884c\u52d5\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u4f7f\u6b64\u985e AI \u4ee3\u7406\u7a0b\u5f0f\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u5177\u6709\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u5b83\u4e5f\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u65b0\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u61c9\u958b\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6982\u8ff0\u9019\u4e9b\u98a8\u96aa\u548c\u597d\u8655\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9805\u539f\u5247\u4f86\u5f15\u5c0e\u60c5\u7bc0\u8a18\u61b6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u9019\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u52a0\u5f37\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7834\u58de\u8b93 AI \u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8cf4\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "author": "Chad DeChant et.al.", "authors": "Chad DeChant", "id": "2501.11739v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11739v1", "repo": "null"}}

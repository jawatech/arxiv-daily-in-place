With the introduction of ChatGPT, an evaluation of its\nsimplification performance is needed. We provide a systematic comparison of\nhuman and ChatGPT simplified texts using fourteen metrics indicative of text\ndifficulty. We briefly introduce our online editor where these simplification\ntools, including ChatGPT, are available. We scored twelve corpora using our\nmetrics: six text, one audio, and five ChatGPT simplified corpora. We then\ncompare these corpora with texts simplified and verified in a prior user study.\nFinally, a medical domain expert evaluated these texts and five, new ChatGPT\nsimplified versions. We found that simple corpora show higher similarity with\nthe human simplified texts. ChatGPT simplification moves metrics in the right\ndirection. The medical domain expert evaluation showed a preference for the\nChatGPT style, but the text itself was rated lower for content retention.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Gondy Leroy et.al.", "authors": "Gondy Leroy,David Kauchak,Philip Harber,Ankit Pal,Akash Shukla", "id": "2405.01592v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01592v1", "repo": "null"}}

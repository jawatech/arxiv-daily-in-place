While existing contrastive\nlearning-based text clustering methods only focus on modeling instance-wise\nsemantic similarity relationships, they ignore contextual information and\nunderlying relationships among all instances that needs to be clustered. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel text clustering approach called Subspace\nContrastive Learning (SCL) which models cluster-wise relationships among\ninstances. Specifically, the proposed SCL consists of two main modules: (1) a\nself-expressive module that constructs virtual positive samples and (2) a\ncontrastive learning module that further learns a discriminative subspace to\ncapture task-specific cluster-wise relationships among texts. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed SCL method not only has achieved superior\nresults on multiple task clustering datasets but also has less complexity in\npositive sample construction.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u5df2\u983b\u7e41\u7528\u65bc\u5b78\u7fd2\u6587\u5b57\u5206\u7fa4\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5fb5\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5206\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u50c5\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5efa\u6a21\u5be6\u4f8b\u7d1a\u8a9e\u7fa9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u9700\u8981\u5206\u7fa4\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u5b50\u7a7a\u9593\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2 (SCL) \u7684\u65b0\u6587\u5b57\u5206\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c0d\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u7fa4\u96c6\u95dc\u4fc2\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SCL \u5305\u542b\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u7d44\uff1a(1) \u5efa\u69cb\u865b\u64ec\u6b63\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u8868\u9054\u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca (2) \u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5b78\u7fd2\u5224\u5225\u5b50\u7a7a\u9593\u4ee5\u64f7\u53d6\u6587\u5b57\u4e4b\u9593\u8207\u4efb\u52d9\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u7fa4\u96c6\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u7d44\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SCL \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u50c5\u5728\u591a\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\u5206\u7fa4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u512a\u7570\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6b63\u6a23\u672c\u5efa\u69cb\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8f03\u4e0d\u8907\u96dc\u3002", "author": "Qian Yong et.al.", "authors": "Qian Yong, Chen Chen, Xiabing Zhou", "id": "2408.14119v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14119v1", "repo": "null"}}

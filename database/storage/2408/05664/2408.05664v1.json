In this paper, we present two types of students that NLP courses might\nwant to train. First, an \"NLP engineer\" who is able to flexibly design, build\nand apply new technologies in NLP for a wide range of tasks. Second, an \"NLP\nscholar\" who is able to pose, refine and answer questions in NLP and how it\nrelates to the society, while also learning to effectively communicate these\nanswers to a broader audience. While these two types of skills are not mutually\nexclusive -- NLP engineers should be able to think critically, and NLP scholars\nshould be able to build systems -- we think that courses can differ in the\nbalance of these skills. As educators at Small Liberal Arts Colleges, the\nstrengths of our students and our institution favors an approach that is better\nsuited to train NLP scholars. In this paper we articulate what kinds of skills\nan NLP scholar should have, and then adopt a backwards design to propose course\ncomponents that can aid the acquisition of these skills.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u767c\u5c55\u6fc0\u767c\u4e86\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u6df1\u5165\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u548c\u71b1\u60c5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa NLP \u8ab2\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5e0c\u671b\u57f9\u990a\u7684\u5169\u7a2e\u5b78\u751f\u985e\u578b\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u300cNLP \u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\u300d\u80fd\u5920\u9748\u6d3b\u5730\u8a2d\u8a08\u3001\u5efa\u69cb\u548c\u61c9\u7528 NLP \u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u4f86\u57f7\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u300cNLP \u5b78\u8005\u300d\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u7cbe\u7149\u548c\u56de\u7b54 NLP \u4e2d\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u8207\u793e\u6703\u7684\u95dc\u806f\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u5b78\u7fd2\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u7b54\u6848\u50b3\u9054\u7d66\u66f4\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u53d7\u773e\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u6280\u80fd\u985e\u578b\u4e26\u975e\u4e92\u65a5\u7684\u2014\u2014NLP \u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\u61c9\u8a72\u5177\u5099\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c NLP \u5b78\u8005\u61c9\u8a72\u80fd\u5920\u5efa\u69cb\u7cfb\u7d71\u2014\u2014\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u8ab2\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e2d\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0f\u578b\u6587\u7406\u5b78\u9662\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5b78\u751f\u548c\u6a5f\u69cb\u7684\u512a\u52e2\u6709\u5229\u65bc\u63a1\u7528\u66f4\u9069\u5408\u57f9\u8a13 NLP \u5b78\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u95e1\u660e NLP \u5b78\u8005\u61c9\u8a72\u5177\u5099\u54ea\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u63a1\u7528\u9006\u5411\u8a2d\u8a08\u4f86\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u7fd2\u5f97\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "author": "Grusha Prasad et.al.", "authors": "Grusha Prasad, Forrest Davis", "id": "2408.05664v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05664v1", "repo": "null"}}

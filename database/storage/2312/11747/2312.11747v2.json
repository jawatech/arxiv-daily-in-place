While extensively\nresearched in domains such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicles, Graph\nCounterfactual Explanation (GCE) methods have been comparatively\nunder-explored. GCEs generate a new graph similar to the original one, with a\ndifferent outcome grounded on the underlying predictive model. Among these GCE\ntechniques, those rooted in generative mechanisms have received relatively\nlimited investigation despite demonstrating impressive accomplishments in other\ndomains, such as artistic styles and natural language modelling. The preference\nfor generative explainers stems from their capacity to generate counterfactual\ninstances during inference, leveraging autonomously acquired perturbations of\nthe input graph. Motivated by the rationales above, our study introduces\nRSGG-CE, a novel Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual\nExplanations able to produce counterfactual examples from the learned latent\nspace considering a partially ordered generation sequence. Furthermore, we\nundertake quantitative and qualitative analyses to compare RSGG-CE's\nperformance against SoA generative explainers, highlighting its increased\nability to engendering plausible counterfactual candidates.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Mario Alfonso Prado-Romero et.al.", "authors": "Mario Alfonso Prado-Romero,Bardh Prenkaj,Giovanni Stilo", "id": "2312.11747v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11747v2", "repo": "null"}}

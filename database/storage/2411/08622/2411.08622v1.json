{"2411.08622": {"publish_time": "2024-11-13", "title": "Precision-Focused Reinforcement Learning Model for Robotic Object Pushing", "paper_summary": "Non-prehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects to a desired target\nposition, is an important skill for robots to assist humans in everyday\nsituations. However, the task is challenging due to the large variety of\nobjects with different and sometimes unknown physical properties, such as\nshape, size, mass, and friction. This can lead to the object overshooting its\ntarget position, requiring fast corrective movements of the robot around the\nobject, especially in cases where objects need to be precisely pushed. In this\npaper, we improve the state-of-the-art by introducing a new memory-based\nvision-proprioception RL model to push objects more precisely to target\npositions using fewer corrective movements.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u975e\u6293\u53d6\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5c07\u7269\u9ad4\u63a8\u5230\u76ee\u6a19\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u662f\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5354\u52a9\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5f62\u72c0\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8cea\u91cf\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u6709\u6642\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7269\u9ad4\u7a2e\u985e\u7e41\u591a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9019\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u3002\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u7269\u9ad4\u8d85\u51fa\u5176\u76ee\u6a19\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5feb\u901f\u4fee\u6b63\u7269\u9ad4\u5468\u570d\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u78ba\u63a8\u52d5\u7269\u9ad4\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u8a18\u61b6\u7684\u8996\u89ba\u672c\u9ad4\u611f\u89ba RL \u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u6539\u9032\u73fe\u6709\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u52d5\u4f5c\u5c07\u7269\u9ad4\u66f4\u7cbe\u78ba\u5730\u63a8\u5230\u76ee\u6a19\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "author": "Lara Bergmann et.al.", "authors": "Lara Bergmann, David Leins, Robert Haschke, Klaus Neumann", "id": "2411.08622v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08622v1", "repo": "https://github.com/ubi-coro/precise_pushing"}}

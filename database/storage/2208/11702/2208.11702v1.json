Synthetic data created using Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) appears to be a good solution to mitigate the\nissues with privacy policies. The other type of cure is decentralized protocol\nacross multiple medical institutions without exchanging local data samples. In\nthis paper, we explored unconditional and conditional GANs in centralized and\ndecentralized settings. The centralized setting imitates studies on large but\nhighly unbalanced skin lesion dataset, while the decentralized one simulates a\nmore realistic hospital scenario with three institutions. We evaluated models'\nperformance in terms of fidelity, diversity, speed of training, and predictive\nability of classifiers trained on the generated synthetic data. In addition we\nprovided explainability through exploration of latent space and embeddings\nprojection focused both on global and local explanations. Calculated distance\nbetween real images and their projections in the latent space proved the\nauthenticity and generalization of trained GANs, which is one of the main\nconcerns in this type of applications.

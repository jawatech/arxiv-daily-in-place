Recent\nrecommender systems based on generative retrieval have leveraged the\ninferential abilities of LMs to directly generate the index tokens of the next\nitem, based on item sequences within the user's interaction history. Previous\nstudies have mostly focused on item indices based solely on textual semantic or\ncollaborative information. However, although the standalone effectiveness of\nthese aspects has been demonstrated, the integration of this information has\nremained unexplored. Our in-depth analysis finds that there is a significant\ndifference in the knowledge captured by the model from heterogeneous item\nindices and diverse input prompts, which can have a high potential for\ncomplementarity. In this paper, we propose SC-Rec, a unified recommender system\nthat learns diverse preference knowledge from two distinct item indices and\nmultiple prompt templates. Furthermore, SC-Rec adopts a novel reranking\nstrategy that aggregates a set of ranking results, inferred based on different\nindices and prompts, to achieve the self-consistency of the model. Our\nempirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that SC-Rec\nconsiderably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for sequential\nrecommendation, effectively incorporating complementary knowledge from varied\noutputs of the model.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u5148\u9032\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u57fa\u65bc\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6aa2\u7d22\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u5229\u7528\u4e86 LM \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4e92\u52d5\u6b77\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u5e8f\u5217\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u6a19\u8a18\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u65bc\u50c5\u57fa\u65bc\u6587\u672c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u6216\u5354\u4f5c\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7368\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5df2\u7d93\u5f97\u5230\u8b49\u5be6\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u63a2\u8a0e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5f9e\u7570\u8cea\u9805\u76ee\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u8f38\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5b58\u5728\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u9019\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u4e92\u88dc\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa SC-Rec\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5b83\u5f9e\u5169\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u591a\u500b\u63d0\u793a\u7bc4\u672c\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u504f\u597d\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSC-Rec \u63a1\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b83\u5f59\u7e3d\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u57fa\u65bc\u4e0d\u540c\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u63a8\u65b7\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4e09\u500b\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u5be6\u8b49\u8a55\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSC-Rec \u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u85a6\u65b9\u9762\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u7a2e\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u4e92\u88dc\u77e5\u8b58\u3002", "author": "Tongyoung Kim et.al.", "authors": "Tongyoung Kim, Soojin Yoon, Seongku Kang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee", "id": "2408.08686v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686v1", "repo": "null"}}

The CAs were designed to facilitate knowledge sharing among\nfactory operators. Our investigation focused on smartphone-based voice\nassistants and LLM-powered chatbots, examining their usability and utility in a\nreal-world factory setting. Based on the qualitative feedback we collected\nduring the deployments of CAs at the factories, we conducted a thematic\nanalysis to investigate the perceptions, challenges, and overall impact on\nworkflow and knowledge sharing.\n  Our results indicate that while CAs have the potential to significantly\nimprove efficiency through knowledge sharing and quicker resolution of\nproduction issues, they also introduce concerns around workplace surveillance,\nthe types of knowledge that can be shared, and shortcomings compared to\nhuman-to-human knowledge sharing. Additionally, our findings stress the\nimportance of addressing privacy, knowledge contribution burdens, and tensions\nbetween factory operators and their managers.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e24\u5e74\u7eb5\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u5382\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba4\u77e5\u52a9\u7406 (CA) \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002CA \u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5de5\u5382\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u548c LLM \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5382\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5de5\u5382\u90e8\u7f72 CA \u671f\u95f4\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8c03\u67e5\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3001\u6311\u6218\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136 CA \u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u4ea7\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d21\u732e\u8d1f\u62c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u5382\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e0e\u5176\u7ecf\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "author": "Samuel Kernan Freire et.al.", "authors": "Samuel Kernan Freire, Tianhao He, Chaofan Wang, Evangelos Niforatos, Alessandro Bozzon", "id": "2409.20192v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20192v1", "repo": "null"}}

This is a desirable modelling feature\nin several applications, but allowing it without restrictions is problematic\nfor several reasons, mainly because it causes undecidability. Therefore,\npractical languages either forbid metamodeling explicitly or treat occurrences\nof classes as instances to be semantically different from other occurrences,\nthereby not allowing metamodeling semantically. Several extensions have been\nproposed to provide metamodeling to some extent. Building on earlier work that\nreduces metamodeling query answering to Datalog query answering, recently\nreductions to query answering over hybrid knowledge bases were proposed with\nthe aim of using the Datalog transformation only where necessary. Preliminary\nwork showed that the approach works, but the hoped-for performance improvements\nwere not observed yet. In this work we expand on this body of work by improving\nthe theoretical basis of the reductions and by using alternative tools that\nshow competitive performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u6307\u672c\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5834\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u985e\u5225\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u985e\u5225\u6210\u54e1\u6216\u51fa\u73fe\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u4e2d\u3002\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5728\u591a\u500b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5141\u8a31\u5b83\u4e0d\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u6703\u56e0\u591a\u500b\u539f\u56e0\u800c\u7522\u751f\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u7121\u6cd5\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5be6\u7528\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6703\u660e\u78ba\u7981\u6b62\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6216\u5c07\u985e\u5225\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u8996\u70ba\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u51fa\u73fe\u8a9e\u7fa9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5141\u8a31\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5df2\u7d93\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u500b\u64f4\u5145\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u5c07\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\u67e5\u8a62\u56de\u7b54\u7c21\u5316\u70ba Datalog \u67e5\u8a62\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c07\u67e5\u8a62\u56de\u7b54\u7c21\u5316\u70ba\u6df7\u5408\u77e5\u8b58\u5eab\u7684\u7c21\u5316\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u50c5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u6642\u4f7f\u7528 Datalog \u8f49\u63db\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u986f\u793a\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u9810\u671f\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u6539\u5584\u7c21\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u57fa\u790e\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u73fe\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u64f4\u5c55\u4e86\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "author": "Haya Majid Qureshi et.al.", "authors": "Haya Majid Qureshi, Wolfgang Faber", "id": "2502.09206v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09206v1", "repo": "null"}}

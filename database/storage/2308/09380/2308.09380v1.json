This\nopacity makes them challenging to trust in clinical practice. Recently,\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a specialized\ntechnique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by revealing\nhow the prediction is derived, thus promoting the use of AI systems in\nhealthcare. This paper presents the first survey of XAI techniques used for\nknee OA diagnosis. The XAI techniques are discussed from two perspectives: data\ninterpretability and model interpretability. The aim of this paper is to\nprovide valuable insights into XAI's potential towards a more reliable knee OA\ndiagnosis approach and encourage its adoption in clinical practice.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yun Xin Teoh et.al.", "authors": "Yun Xin Teoh,Alice Othmani,Siew Li Goh,Juliana Usman,Khin Wee Lai", "id": "2308.09380v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09380v1", "repo": "null"}}

Investigation of Human-Centered XAI for Mobile Health Apps", "paper_summary": "In healthcare, AI systems support clinicians and patients in diagnosis,\ntreatment, and monitoring, but many systems' poor explainability remains\nchallenging for practical application. Overcoming this barrier is the goal of\nexplainable AI (XAI). However, an explanation can be perceived differently and,\nthus, not solve the black-box problem for everyone. The domain of\nHuman-Centered AI deals with this problem by adapting AI to users. We present a\nuser-centered persona concept to evaluate XAI and use it to investigate\nend-users preferences for various explanation styles and contents in a mobile\nhealth stress monitoring application. The results of our online survey show\nthat users' demographics and personality, as well as the type of explanation,\nimpact explanation preferences, indicating that these are essential features\nfor XAI design. We subsumed the results in three prototypical user personas:\npower-, casual-, and privacy-oriented users. Our insights bring an interactive,\nhuman-centered XAI closer to practical application.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Katharina Weitz et.al.", "authors": "Katharina Weitz,Alexander Zellner,Elisabeth Andr\u00e9", "id": "2210.03506v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03506v1", "repo": "null"}}

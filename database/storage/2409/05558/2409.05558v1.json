However, advances in image recognition models\npose a significant threat to such CAPTCHAs. These models can easily be fooled\nby generating some well-hidden \"random\" noise and adding it to the image, or\nhiding objects in the image. However, these methods are model-specific and thus\ncan not aid CAPTCHAs in fooling all models. We show in this work that by\nallowing for more significant changes to the images while preserving the\nsemantic information and keeping it solvable by humans, we can fool many\nstate-of-the-art models. Specifically, we demonstrate that by adding masks of\nvarious intensities the Accuracy @ 1 (Acc@1) drops by more than 50%-points for\nall models, and supposedly robust models such as vision transformers see an\nAcc@1 drop of 80%-points.\n  These masks can therefore effectively fool modern image classifiers, thus\nshowing that machines have not caught up with humans -- yet.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u4ee3 CAPTCHA \u56b4\u91cd\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u8996\u89ba\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u96fb\u8166\u4f86\u8aaa\u5f88\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u4f86\u8aaa\u537b\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f71\u50cf\u8fa8\u8b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e CAPTCHA \u69cb\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u8105\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u4e9b\u96b1\u85cf\u826f\u597d\u7684\u300c\u96a8\u6a5f\u300d\u96dc\u8a0a\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u52a0\u5165\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u6216\u5c07\u7269\u4ef6\u96b1\u85cf\u5728\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u6240\u611a\u5f04\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u5b9a\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7121\u6cd5\u5e6b\u52a9 CAPTCHA \u611a\u5f04\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6b64\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5141\u8a31\u5c0d\u5f71\u50cf\u9032\u884c\u66f4\u986f\u8457\u7684\u8b8a\u66f4\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u7559\u8a9e\u610f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e26\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u611a\u5f04\u8a31\u591a\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u900f\u904e\u52a0\u5165\u5404\u7a2e\u5f37\u5ea6\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u7387 @ 1 (Acc@1) \u4e0b\u964d\u8d85\u904e 50%\uff0c\u800c\u64da\u7a31\u5f37\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8996\u89ba\u8f49\u63db\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u6e96\u78ba\u7387 @ 1 \u4e0b\u964d 80%\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u906e\u7f69\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u611a\u5f04\u73fe\u4ee3\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u8868\u660e\u6a5f\u5668\u5c1a\u672a\u8d95\u4e0a\u4eba\u985e\u2014\u2014\u81f3\u5c11\u76ee\u524d\u9084\u6c92\u6709\u3002", "author": "Yahya Jabary et.al.", "authors": "Yahya Jabary, Andreas Plesner, Turlan Kuzhagaliyev, Roger Wattenhofer", "id": "2409.05558v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05558v1", "repo": "null"}}

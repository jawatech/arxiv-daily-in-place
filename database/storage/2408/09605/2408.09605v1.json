From Pure Thinkers to Large Language Models", "paper_summary": "Does the capacity to think require the capacity to sense? A lively debate on\nthis topic runs throughout the history of philosophy and now animates\ndiscussions of artificial intelligence. I argue that in principle, there can be\npure thinkers: thinkers that lack the capacity to sense altogether. I also\nargue for significant limitations in just what sort of thought is possible in\nthe absence of the capacity to sense. Regarding AI, I do not argue directly\nthat large language models can think or understand, but I rebut one important\nargument (the argument from sensory grounding) that they cannot. I also use\nrecent results regarding language models to address the question of whether or\nhow sensory grounding enhances cognitive capacities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u601d\u8003\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1f\u95dc\u65bc\u6b64\u4e3b\u984c\u7684\u71b1\u70c8\u8faf\u8ad6\u8cab\u7a7f\u54f2\u5b78\u53f2\uff0c\u73fe\u5728\u4e5f\u6fc0\u767c\u4e86\u5c0d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u6211\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u539f\u5247\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u7d14\u7cb9\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u5bb6\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u5bb6\u3002\u6211\u4e5f\u4e3b\u5f35\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u7a2e\u985e\u50c5\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u95dc\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4e26\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u4e3b\u5f35\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u601d\u8003\u6216\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u53cd\u99c1\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8ad6\u9ede\uff08\u611f\u5b98\u57fa\u790e\u8ad6\u9ede\uff09\uff0c\u8a8d\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4e5f\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u95dc\u65bc\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u4f86\u63a2\u8a0e\u611f\u5b98\u57fa\u790e\u662f\u5426\u6216\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f37\u8a8d\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "David J.

Traditional glaucoma screening is a\ntime-consuming process that necessitates the medical professionals' constant\nattention, and even so time to time due to the time constrains and pressure\nthey fail to classify correctly that leads to wrong treatment. Numerous efforts\nhave been made to automate the entire glaucoma classification procedure\nhowever, these existing models in general have a black box characteristics that\nprevents users from understanding the key reasons behind the prediction and\nthus medical practitioners generally can not rely on these system. In this\narticle after comparing with various pre-trained models, we propose a transfer\nlearning model that is able to classify Glaucoma with 94.71\\% accuracy. In\naddition, we have utilized Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic\nExplanations(LIME) that introduces explainability in our system. This\nimprovement enables medical professionals obtain important and comprehensive\ninformation that aid them in making judgments. It also lessen the opacity and\nfragility of the traditional deep learning models.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Touhidul Islam Chayan et.al.", "authors": "Touhidul Islam Chayan,Anita Islam,Eftykhar Rahman,Md.

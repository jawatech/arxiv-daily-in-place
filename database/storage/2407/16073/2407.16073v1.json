To address this challenge, we introduce two\nproduct question-answering (QA) datasets focused on Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop\nproducts to help evaluate the performance of existing models on domain-specific\nproduct QA tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel knowledge-driven RAG-QA\nframework to enhance the performance of the models in the product QA task. Our\nexperiments demonstrated that inducing domain knowledge through query\nreformulation allowed for increased retrieval and generative performance when\ncompared to standard RAG-QA methods. This improvement, however, is slight, and\nthus illustrates the challenge posed by the datasets introduced.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7531\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u554f\u7b54\u6700\u8fd1\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u6975\u5927\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u8a55\u4f30\u9019\u4e9b\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u64ec\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u5834\u666f\u7684\u5408\u9069\u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u9805\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u7522\u54c1\u554f\u7b54 (QA) \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc Adobe Acrobat \u548c Photoshop \u7522\u54c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u8a55\u4f30\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u7522\u54c1 QA \u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u9a45\u52d5 RAG-QA \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7522\u54c1 QA \u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u6a19\u6e96 RAG-QA \u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u67e5\u8a62\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u4f86\u8a98\u5c0e\u9818\u57df\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6aa2\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u6539\u9032\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u5f15\u5165\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u6240\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Swetha Eppalapally et.al.", "authors": "Swetha Eppalapally, Daksh Dangi, Chaithra Bhat, Ankita Gupta, Ruiyi Zhang, Shubham Agarwal, Karishma Bagga, Seunghyun Yoon, Nedim Lipka, Ryan A.

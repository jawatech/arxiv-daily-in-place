To mitigate crop yield\nlosses caused by nematodes, an efficient nematode monitoring method is\nessential for plant and crop disease management. In other respects, efficient\nnematode detection contributes to medical research and drug discovery, as\nnematodes are model organisms. With the rapid development of computer\ntechnology, computer vision techniques provide a feasible solution for\nquantifying nematodes or nematode infections. In this paper, we survey and\ncategorise the studies and available datasets on nematode detection through\ndeep-learning models. To stimulate progress in related research, this survey\npresents the potential state-of-the-art object detection models, training\ntechniques, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics for deep learning\nbeginners. Moreover, seven state-of-the-art object detection models are\nvalidated on three public datasets and the AgriNema dataset for plant parasitic\nnematodes to construct a baseline for nematode detection.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Zhipeng Yuan et.al.", "authors": "Zhipeng Yuan,Nasamu Musa,Katarzyna Dybal,Matthew Back,Daniel Leybourne,Po Yang", "id": "2404.19748v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19748v1", "repo": "null"}}

An Investigation of Large Language Models for Entity Matching", "paper_summary": "Entity matching (EM) is a critical step in entity resolution. Recently,\nentity matching based on large language models (LLMs) has shown great promise.\nHowever, current LLM-based entity matching approaches typically follow a binary\nmatching paradigm that ignores the global consistency between different\nrecords. In this paper, we investigate various methodologies for LLM-based\nentity matching that incorporate record interactions from different\nperspectives. Specifically, we comprehensively compare three representative\nstrategies: matching, comparing, and selecting, and analyze their respective\nadvantages and challenges in diverse scenarios. Based on our findings, we\nfurther design a compositional entity matching (ComEM) framework that leverages\nthe composition of multiple strategies and LLMs. In this way, ComEM can benefit\nfrom the advantages of different sides and achieve improvements in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that ComEM not only\nachieves significant performance gains on various datasets but also reduces the\ncost of LLM-based entity matching in real-world application.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d (EM) \u662f\u5be6\u9ad4\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u6975\u5927\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u524d\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9075\u5faa\u4e8c\u5143\u914d\u5c0d\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u8a18\u9304\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6574\u5408\u8a18\u9304\u4e92\u52d5\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u4e09\u7a2e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u914d\u5c0d\u3001\u6bd4\u8f03\u548c\u9078\u64c7\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u81ea\u512a\u52e2\u548c\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6211\u5011\u7684\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7d44\u5408\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d (ComEM) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u7a2e\u7b56\u7565\u548c LLM \u7684\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u9019\u6a23\uff0cComEM \u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u512a\u52e2\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cComEM \u4e0d\u50c5\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9084\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 LLM \u57fa\u65bc\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "author": "Tianshu Wang et.al.", "authors": "Tianshu Wang, Hongyu Lin, Xiaoyang Chen, Xianpei Han, Hao Wang, Zhenyu Zeng, Le Sun", "id": "2405.16884v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16884v1", "repo": "https://github.com/tshu-w/llm4em"}}

Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental\ndisorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with\nthe diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and\nmay not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network\narchitecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with\nthe reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system\nuses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder\nclass, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve\nscalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction\nmethod to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses\nthe lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more\ntrustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yeldar Toleubay et.al.", "authors": "Yeldar Toleubay,Don Joven Agravante,Daiki Kimura,Baihan Lin,Djallel Bouneffouf,Michiaki Tatsubori", "id": "2306.03902v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03902v1", "repo": "null"}}

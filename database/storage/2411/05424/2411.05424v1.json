To\nfacilitate the access for students, a variety of platforms, visual tools, and\ndigital games are already being used to introduce ML concepts and strengthen\nthe understanding of how AI works. We take a look at didactic principles that\nare employed for teaching computer science, define criteria, and, based on\nthose, evaluate a selection of prominent existing platforms, tools, and games.\nAdditionally, we criticize the approach of portraying ML mostly as a black-box\nand the resulting missing focus on creating an understanding of data,\nalgorithms, and models that come with it. To tackle this issue, we present a\nconcept that covers intermodal transfer, computational and explanatory\nthinking, ICE-T, as an extension of known didactic principles. With our\nmulti-faceted concept, we believe that planners of learning units, creators of\nlearning platforms and educators can improve on teaching ML.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (AI) \u548c\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u6b63\u9010\u6f38\u9032\u5165\u6559\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u65b9\u4fbf\u5b78\u751f\u53d6\u5f97\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u5df2\u7d93\u958b\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u7a2e\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u8996\u89ba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6578\u4f4d\u904a\u6232\u4f86\u4ecb\u7d39 ML \u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e26\u52a0\u5f37\u5c0d AI \u904b\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u7528\u65bc\u6559\u6388\u96fb\u8166\u79d1\u5b78\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u539f\u5247\u3001\u5b9a\u7fa9\u6a19\u6e96\uff0c\u4e26\u6839\u64da\u9019\u4e9b\u6a19\u6e96\u8a55\u4f30\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u540d\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u904a\u6232\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6279\u8a55\u5c07 ML \u63cf\u7e6a\u6210\u4e00\u500b\u9ed1\u76d2\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u6b64\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5c0d\u5efa\u7acb\u5c0d\u8cc7\u6599\u3001\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u96a8\u4e4b\u800c\u4f86\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6db5\u84cb\u8de8\u6a21\u614b\u8f49\u79fb\u3001\u904b\u7b97\u548c\u8aaa\u660e\u6027\u601d\u8003 (ICE-T) \u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u5df2\u77e5\u6559\u5b78\u539f\u5247\u7684\u5ef6\u4f38\u3002\u900f\u904e\u6211\u5011\u591a\u9762\u5411\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u5b78\u7fd2\u55ae\u5143\u7684\u898f\u5283\u8005\u3001\u5b78\u7fd2\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5275\u5efa\u8005\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u9032 ML \u6559\u5b78\u3002", "author": "Hendrik Krone et.al.", "authors": "Hendrik Krone, Pierre Haritz, Thomas Liebig", "id": "2411.05424v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05424v1", "repo": "null"}}

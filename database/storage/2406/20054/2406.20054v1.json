While both phenomena have been studied extensively in NLP, leading\nto dedicated systems, they are often been considered independently. While many\ntasks dealing with polysemy (e.g. Word Sense Disambiguiation or Induction)\nhighlight the role of a word's senses, the study of synonymy is rooted in the\nstudy of concepts, i.e. meaning shared across the lexicon. In this paper, we\nintroduce Concept Induction, the unsupervised task of learning a soft\nclustering among words that defines a set of concepts directly from data. This\ntask generalizes that of Word Sense Induction. We propose a bi-level approach\nto Concept Induction that leverages both a local lemma-centric view and a\nglobal cross-lexicon perspective to induce concepts. We evaluate the obtained\nclustering on SemCor's annotated data and obtain good performances (BCubed F1\nabove 0.60). We find that the local and the global levels are mutually\nbeneficial to induce concepts and also senses in our setting. Finally, we\ncreate static embeddings representing our induced concepts and use them on the\nWord-in-Context task, obtaining competitive performances with the\nState-of-the-Art.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u7fa9\u548c\u540c\u7fa9\u662f\u8a5e\u5f59\u6b67\u7fa9\u7684\u5169\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u76f8\u95dc\u9762\u76f8\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5169\u7a2e\u73fe\u8c61\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0e\u81f4\u5c08\u7528\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u7368\u7acb\u5730\u8003\u616e\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u8a31\u591a\u8655\u7406\u591a\u7fa9\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u8a5e\u7fa9\u6d88\u6b67\u6216\u6b78\u7d0d\uff09\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u8a5e\u5f59\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u7fa9\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u690d\u57fa\u65bc\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5373\u8a5e\u5f59\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4ecb\u7d39\u6982\u5ff5\u6b78\u7d0d\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5f9e\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e00\u7d44\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8a5e\u5f59\u4e4b\u9593\u5b78\u7fd2\u8edf\u805a\u985e\u7684\u975e\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u6b64\u4efb\u52d9\u6982\u62ec\u4e86\u8a5e\u7fa9\u6b78\u7d0d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u96d9\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6b78\u7d0d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8a5e\u5143\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c0\u9ede\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u8a5e\u5f59\u89c0\u9ede\u4f86\u6b78\u7d0d\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 SemCor \u7684\u8a3b\u89e3\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u8a55\u4f30\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u805a\u985e\uff0c\u4e26\u7372\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff08BCubed F1 \u9ad8\u65bc 0.60\uff09\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5c64\u7d1a\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5c0d\u65bc\u6b78\u7d0d\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u610f\u7fa9\u90fd\u662f\u4e92\u5229\u7684\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6211\u5011\u6b78\u7d0d\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u975c\u614b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u7528\u65bc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8a5e\u5f59\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u7372\u5f97\u8207\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u7af6\u722d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Bastien Li\u00e9tard et.al.", "authors": "Bastien Li\u00e9tard, Pascal Denis, Mikaella Keller", "id": "2406.20054v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20054v1", "repo": "null"}}

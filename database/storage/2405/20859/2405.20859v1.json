In this paper, we take one of the proposed frameworks for\nsetting up such game-play environments, and further test its usefulness as an\nevaluation instrument, along a number of dimensions: We show that it can easily\nkeep up with new developments while avoiding data contamination, we show that\nthe tests implemented within it are not yet saturated (human performance is\nsubstantially higher than that of even the best models), and we show that it\nlends itself to investigating additional questions, such as the impact of the\nprompting language on performance. We believe that the approach forms a good\nbasis for making decisions on model choice for building applied interactive\nsystems, and perhaps ultimately setting up a closed-loop development\nenvironment of system and simulated evaluator.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u63d0\u793a\u201c\u81ea\u884c\u73a9\u800d\u201d\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6e38\u620f\u63a2\u67e5\u67d0\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u822c\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6218\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6cbf\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u8ddf\u4e0a\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c1a\u672a\u9971\u548c\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u751a\u81f3\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u67e5\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u505a\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u3002", "author": "Anne Beyer et.al.", "authors": "Anne Beyer, Kranti Chalamalasetti, Sherzod Hakimov, Brielen Madureira, Philipp Sadler, David Schlangen", "id": "2405.20859v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20859v1", "repo": "null"}}

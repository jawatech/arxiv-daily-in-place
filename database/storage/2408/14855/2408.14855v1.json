We hypothesize\nthat model-based RL can solve analogical reasoning tasks more efficiently\nthrough the creation of internal models. To test this, we compared DreamerV3, a\nmodel-based RL method, with Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free RL\nmethod, on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks. Our results\nindicate that model-based RL not only outperforms model-free RL in learning and\ngeneralizing from single tasks but also shows significant advantages in\nreasoning across similar tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u8b49\u660e\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684 RL\uff09\u662f\u985e\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u9069\u7576\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684 RL \u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u5efa\u7acb\u5167\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5730\u89e3\u6c7a\u985e\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6e2c\u8a66\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684 RL \u65b9\u6cd5 DreamerV3 \u548c\u7121\u6a21\u578b RL \u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u4f73\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u8207\u63a8\u7406\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab (ARC) \u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684 RL \u4e0d\u50c5\u5728\u55ae\u4e00\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u6982\u62ec\u4e0a\u512a\u65bc\u7121\u6a21\u578b RL\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u985e\u4f3c\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4e5f\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u512a\u52e2\u3002", "author": "Jihwan Lee et.al.", "authors": "Jihwan Lee, Woochang Sim, Sejin Kim, Sundong Kim", "id": "2408.14855v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14855v1", "repo": "null"}}

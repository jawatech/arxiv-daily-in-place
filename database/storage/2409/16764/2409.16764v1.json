Online RL has been adopted for radio resource\nmanagement (RRM), taking over traditional schemes. However, due to its reliance\non online interaction with the environment, its role becomes limited in\npractical, real-world problems where online interaction is not feasible. In\naddition, traditional RL stands short in front of the uncertainties and risks\nin real-world stochastic environments. In this manner, we propose an offline\nand distributional RL scheme for the RRM problem, enabling offline training\nusing a static dataset without any interaction with the environment and\nconsidering the sources of uncertainties using the distributions of the return.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms\nconventional resource management models. In addition, it is the only scheme\nthat surpasses online RL and achieves a $16 \\%$ gain over online RL.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u5df2\u8b49\u660e\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u667a\u6167\u7121\u7dda\u7db2\u8def\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002\u7dda\u4e0a RL \u5df2\u88ab\u63a1\u7528\u65bc\u7121\u7dda\u8cc7\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406 (RRM)\uff0c\u63a5\u7ba1\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5b83\u4f9d\u8cf4\u8207\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u554f\u984c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u89d2\u8272\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u7dda\u4e0a\u4e92\u52d5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u50b3\u7d71\u7684 RL \u5728\u9762\u5c0d\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u96a8\u6a5f\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u98a8\u96aa\u6642\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u8655\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d RRM \u554f\u984c\u7684\u96e2\u7dda\u548c\u5206\u914d\u5f0f RL \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975c\u614b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u96e2\u7dda\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u8207\u74b0\u5883\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5831\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4f86\u8003\u91cf\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4f86\u6e90\u3002\u6a21\u64ec\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u8d85\u8d8a\u7dda\u4e0a RL \u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u7dda\u4e0a RL \u4e0a\u7372\u5f97 16% \u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "author": "Eslam Eldeeb et.al.", "authors": "Eslam Eldeeb, Hirley Alves", "id": "2409.16764v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16764v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, recent studies have shown that these\nsystems are vulnerable to carefully crafted small perturbations to their\ninputs, known as adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new type of\nadversarial attack against NMT models. In this attack, we find a word to be\nadded between two sentences such that the second sentence is ignored and not\ntranslated by the NMT model. The word added between the two sentences is such\nthat the whole adversarial text is natural in the source language. This type of\nattack can be harmful in practical scenarios since the attacker can hide\nmalicious information in the automatic translation made by the target NMT\nmodel. Our experiments show that different NMT models and translation tasks are\nvulnerable to this type of attack. Our attack can successfully force the NMT\nmodels to ignore the second part of the input in the translation for more than\n50% of all cases while being able to maintain low perplexity for the whole\ninput.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u795e\u7d93\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\u7cfb\u7d71\u56e0\u5176\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u800c\u7528\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u5176\u8f38\u5165\u9032\u884c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u5c0f\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u7a31\u70ba\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u91dd\u5c0d NMT \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u653b\u64ca\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u8a5e\u8a9e\u52a0\u5728\u5169\u500b\u53e5\u5b50\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e8c\u500b\u53e5\u5b50\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6703\u88ab NMT \u6a21\u578b\u7ffb\u8b6f\u3002\u52a0\u5728\u5169\u500b\u53e5\u5b50\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8a5e\u8a9e\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u500b\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u6587\u672c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e2d\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u653b\u64ca\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u76ee\u6a19 NMT \u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u7ffb\u8b6f\u4e2d\u96b1\u85cf\u60e1\u610f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 NMT \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ffb\u8b6f\u4efb\u52d9\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9019\u7a2e\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u8feb\u4f7f NMT \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u904e 50% \u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u5ffd\u7565\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u80fd\u5920\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u500b\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Sahar Sadrizadeh et.al.", "authors": "Sahar Sadrizadeh, C\u00e9sar Descalzo, Ljiljana Dolamic, Pascal Frossard", "id": "2411.12473v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12473v1", "repo": "null"}}

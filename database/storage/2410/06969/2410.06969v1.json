{"2410.06969": {"publish_time": "2024-10-09", "title": "DLGNet: Hyperedge Classification through Directed Line Graphs for Chemical Reactions", "paper_summary": "Graphs and hypergraphs provide powerful abstractions for modeling\ninteractions among a set of entities of interest and have been attracting a\ngrowing interest in the literature thanks to many successful applications in\nseveral fields. In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as\nchemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule\ngeneration. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical\nreactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed\nhyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction\nclassification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph\n(DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the\nDirected Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG\ntransformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the\nDirected Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of\nthe interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph\nthanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many\ndesirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being\npositive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a\nspectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction\ndatasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average\nrelative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum\nimprovement of 37.71%.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5716\u5f62\u548c\u8d85\u5716\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5c0d\u4e00\u7d44\u611f\u8208\u8da3\u5be6\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7531\u65bc\u5728\u591a\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8a31\u591a\u6210\u529f\u61c9\u7528\u800c\u5099\u53d7\u6587\u737b\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5316\u5b78\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b78\u7b49\u9818\u57df\u8fc5\u901f\u64f4\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u85e5\u7269\u767c\u73fe\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u9818\u57df\u3002\u898b\u8b49\u589e\u9577\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u9818\u57df\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5316\u5b78\u53cd\u61c9\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5316\u5b78\u53cd\u61c9\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u7de8\u78bc\u70ba\u8d85\u5716\u5f62\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8d85\u908a\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5f15\u5165\u8207\u7d66\u5b9a\u5b9a\u5411\u8d85\u5716\u5f62\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u7dda\u5716 (DGL) \u7684\u7b26\u865f\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5316\u5b78\u53cd\u61c9\u5206\u985e\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u69cb\u5efa\u4e86\u5b9a\u5411\u7dda\u5716\u7db2\u8def (DLGNet)\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u8b5c\u7684\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN)\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u901a\u904e\u5176 DLG \u8f49\u63db\u5728\u8d85\u5716\u5f62\u4e0a\u904b\u4f5c\u3002DLGNet \u7684\u57fa\u790e\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684 Hermitian \u77e9\u9663\uff0c\u5373\u5b9a\u5411\u7dda\u5716\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u65bc DLG \u8868\u793a\u800c\u7dca\u6e4a\u5730\u7de8\u78bc\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u5716\u5f62\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8d85\u908a\u5167\u767c\u751f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u3002\u5b9a\u5411\u7dda\u5716\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u627f\u8a8d\u7279\u5fb5\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5176\u975e\u5e38\u9069\u5408\u5728\u57fa\u65bc\u8b5c\u7684 GNN \u4e2d\u63a1\u7528\u3002\u901a\u904e\u5728\u5316\u5b78\u53cd\u61c9\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e DLGNet \u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86 33.01% \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5c0d\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u5dee\u7570\u6539\u9032\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u6539\u9032\u70ba 37.71%\u3002", "author": "Stefano Fiorini et.al.", "authors": "Stefano Fiorini, Giulia M.

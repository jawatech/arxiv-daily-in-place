DNNs are a\npopular tool within machine learning due to their ability to model complex\npatterns and distributions. However, the performance of these networks is\nhighly dependent on the quality of the data used to train the models. Two\ncharacteristics of these sets, noisy labels and training set biases, are known\nto frequently cause poor generalization performance as a result of overfitting\nto the training set. This paper aims to solve this problem using the approach\nproposed by Ren et al. (2018) using meta-training and online weight\napproximation. We will first implement a toy-problem to crudely verify the\nclaims made by the authors of Ren et al. (2018) and then venture into using the\napproach to solve a real world problem of Skin-cancer detection using an\nimbalanced image dataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7db2\u8def (DNN) \u5df2\u7528\u65bc\u70ba\u8a31\u591a\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u5206\u6790\u554f\u984c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5f71\u50cf\u8fa8\u8b58\u548c\u91ab\u7642\u8a3a\u65b7\u3002DNN \u662f\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u5ee3\u53d7\u6b61\u8fce\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u70ba\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u4f48\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ef0\u8cf4\u7528\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u54c1\u8cea\u3002\u5df2\u77e5\u9019\u4e9b\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u5169\u500b\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u96dc\u8a0a\u6a19\u7c64\u548c\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6703\u56e0\u904e\u5ea6\u7b26\u5408\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u800c\u7d93\u5e38\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4f7f\u7528 Ren \u7b49\u4eba (2018) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u7dda\u4e0a\u6b0a\u91cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u9996\u5148\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e00\u500b\u73a9\u5177\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4ee5\u7c97\u7565\u9a57\u8b49 Ren \u7b49\u4eba (2018) \u4f5c\u8005\u6240\u505a\u7684\u4e3b\u5f35\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5617\u8a66\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u76ae\u819a\u764c\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Parth Patil et.al.", "authors": "Parth Patil, Ben Boardley, Jack Gardner, Emily Loiselle, Deerajkumar Parthipan", "id": "2405.06859v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06859v1", "repo": "null"}}

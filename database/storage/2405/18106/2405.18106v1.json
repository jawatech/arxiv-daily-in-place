{"2405.18106": {"publish_time": "2024-05-28", "title": "A Unified Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Model Towards Interpolation and Extrapolation", "paper_summary": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has two settings: interpolation\nreasoning and extrapolation reasoning. Both of them draw plenty of research\ninterest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the\ntemporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter\nrequire strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues\nprovided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG\napplications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed\nspecifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an\noriginal Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation\nand extrapolation reasoning. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning\nfashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data and with fine\ninterpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms\nSOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the\nextrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to\nevaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards\ninterpolation and extrapolation reasoning. More diverse experiments are\nconducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6642\u5e8f\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (TKG) \u63a8\u7406\u6709\u5169\u7a2e\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff1a\u5167\u63d2\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5169\u8005\u90fd\u5f15\u8d77\u8a31\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u524d\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5f37\u8abf\u4e8b\u5be6\u5e8f\u5217\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6642\u9593\u95dc\u806f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5f8c\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u56b4\u683c\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u6642\u9593\u9806\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e26\u5ffd\u7565\u63a8\u8ad6\u904e\u53bb\u7f3a\u5931\u4e8b\u5be6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7dda\u7d22\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e86 TKG \u61c9\u7528\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5e7e\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u73fe\u6709\u7684 TKG \u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u5c08\u9580\u8a2d\u8a08\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u6642\u9593\u8def\u5f91\u7684\u63a8\u7406 (TPAR) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5167\u63d2\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u63a8\u7406\u3002TPAR \u57f7\u884c\u795e\u7d93\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u7b26\u865f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c0d\u6a21\u7a1c\u5169\u53ef\u4e14\u6709\u96dc\u8a0a\u7684\u6642\u9593\u8cc7\u6599\u5177\u6709\u7a69\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u3002\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5167\u63d2\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c\u4efb\u52d9\uff0cTPAR \u7684\u8868\u73fe\u512a\u65bc SOTA \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u7ba1\u7dda\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30 SOTA \u7d44\u5408\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 TPAR \u5c0d\u5167\u63d2\u548c\u5916\u63d2\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u9032\u884c\u66f4\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u986f\u793a TPAR \u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u3002", "author": "Kai Chen et.al.", "authors": "Kai Chen, Ye Wang, Yitong Li, Aiping Li, Han Yu, Xin Song", "id": "2405.18106v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18106v1", "repo": "null"}}

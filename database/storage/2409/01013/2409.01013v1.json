Although INR methods have\nbeen studied for medical image super-resolution, their adaptability to\nlocalized priors in medical images has not been extensively explored. Medical\nimages contain rich anatomical divisions that could provide valuable local\nprior information to enhance the accuracy and robustness of INRs. In this work,\nwe propose a novel framework, referred to as the Semantically Conditioned INR\n(SeCo-INR), that conditions an INR using local priors from a medical image,\nenabling accurate model fitting and interpolation capabilities to achieve\nsuper-resolution. Our framework learns a continuous representation of the\nsemantic segmentation features of a medical image and utilizes it to derive the\noptimal INR for each semantic region of the image. We tested our framework\nusing several medical imaging modalities and achieved higher quantitative\nscores and more realistic super-resolution outputs compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96b1\u5f0f\u795e\u7d93\u8868\u5fb5 (INR) \u8fd1\u671f\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u7121\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5c31\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a0a\u865f\u7684\u9023\u7e8c\u8868\u5fb5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u52d5\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u9818\u57df\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 INR \u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u8d85\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5c0d\u65bc\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u5148\u9a57\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a2\u8a0e\u3002\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u5305\u542b\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b78\u5340\u5206\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5340\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5148\u9a57\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37 INR \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u8a9e\u7fa9\u689d\u4ef6 INR (SeCo-INR)\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5148\u9a57\u4f86\u8abf\u6574 INR\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u64ec\u5408\u548c\u63d2\u503c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u8d85\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u5b78\u7fd2\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u8a9e\u610f\u5206\u5272\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u9023\u7e8c\u8868\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e26\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u70ba\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u6bcf\u500b\u8a9e\u610f\u5340\u57df\u63a8\u5c0e\u6700\u4f73 INR\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7a2e\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u6e2c\u8a66\u6211\u5011\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4e26\u8207\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8a55\u5206\u548c\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u7684\u8d85\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u8f38\u51fa\u3002", "author": "Mevan Ekanayake et.al.", "authors": "Mevan Ekanayake, Zhifeng Chen, Gary Egan, Mehrtash Harandi, Zhaolin Chen", "id": "2409.01013v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01013v1", "repo": "null"}}

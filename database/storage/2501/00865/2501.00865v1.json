We find that by using\naggressive modality dropout we are able to reverse negative co-learning (NCL)\nto positive co-learning (PCL). Aggressive modality dropout can be used to\n\"prep\" a multimodal model for unimodal deployment, and dramatically increases\nmodel performance during negative co-learning, where during some experiments we\nsaw a 20% gain in accuracy. We also benchmark our modality dropout technique\nagainst PCL to show that our modality drop out technique improves co-learning\nduring PCL, although it does not have as much as an substantial effect as it\ndoes during NCL.

Within this domain, ChatGPT and GPT-4, developed\nby OpenAI, and the Gemini, developed by Google, have emerged as particularly\npopular among early adopters. Additionally, Mixtral by Mistral AI and Claude by\nAnthropic are newly released, further expanding the landscape of advanced\nlanguage models. These models are viewed as disruptive technologies with\napplications spanning customer service, education, healthcare, and finance.\nMore recently, Mistral has entered the scene, captivating users with its unique\nability to generate creative content. Understanding the perspectives of these\nusers is crucial, as they can offer valuable insights into the potential\nstrengths, weaknesses, and overall success or failure of these technologies in\nvarious domains. This research delves into the responses generated by ChatGPT,\nGPT-4, Gemini, Mixtral and Claude across different Conversational QA corpora.\nEvaluation scores were meticulously computed and subsequently compared to\nascertain the overall performance of these models. Our study pinpointed\ninstances where these models provided inaccurate answers to questions, offering\ninsights into potential areas where they might be susceptible to errors. In\nessence, this research provides a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of\nthese state of-the-art language models, shedding light on their capabilities\nwhile also highlighting potential areas for improvement", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u8868\u73fe\u800c\u5099\u53d7\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531 OpenAI \u958b\u767c\u7684 ChatGPT \u548c GPT-4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531 Google \u958b\u767c\u7684 Gemini\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u63a1\u7528\u8005\u4e2d\u7279\u5225\u53d7\u6b61\u8fce\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMistral AI \u7684 Mixtral \u548c Anthropic \u7684 Claude \u662f\u6700\u65b0\u767c\u5e03\u7684\uff0c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u64f4\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u9032\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7248\u5716\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u7834\u58de\u6027\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u7528\u6db5\u84cb\u5ba2\u6236\u670d\u52d9\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0cMistral \u9032\u5165\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u7368\u7279\u5275\u9020\u5167\u5bb9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u7528\u6236\u3002\u4e86\u89e3\u9019\u4e9b\u7528\u6236\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf6\u8cb4\u7684\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u5728\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u512a\u52e2\u3001\u52a3\u52e2\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u9ad4\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u6557\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86 ChatGPT\u3001GPT-4\u3001Gemini\u3001Mixtral \u548c Claude \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u5f0f\u554f\u7b54\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\u7522\u751f\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u4ed4\u7d30\u8a08\u7b97\u8a55\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u5b9a\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7cbe\u78ba\u6307\u51fa\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u6e96\u78ba\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u932f\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u9818\u57df\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u5f9e\u672c\u8cea\u4e0a\u8b1b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u548c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u95e1\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u6539\u9032\u9818\u57df\u3002", "author": "Aryan Rangapur et.al.", "authors": "Aryan Rangapur, Aman Rangapur", "id": "2405.18344v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18344v1", "repo": "null"}}

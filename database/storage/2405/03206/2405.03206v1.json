Widely\nembraced by users, the abuse of LLMs is inevitable, particularly in using them\nto generate text content for various purposes, leading to difficulties in\ndistinguishing between text generated by LLMs and that written by humans. In\nthis study, we present a dataset named ViDetect, comprising 6.800 samples of\nVietnamese essay, with 3.400 samples authored by humans and the remainder\ngenerated by LLMs, serving the purpose of detecting text generated by AI. We\nconducted evaluations using state-of-the-art methods, including ViT5, BartPho,\nPhoBERT, mDeberta V3, and mBERT. These results contribute not only to the\ngrowing body of research on detecting text generated by AI but also demonstrate\nthe adaptability and effectiveness of different methods in the Vietnamese\nlanguage context. This research lays the foundation for future advancements in\nAI-generated text detection and provides valuable insights for researchers in\nthe field of natural language processing.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Quang-Dan Tran et.al.", "authors": "Quang-Dan Tran,Van-Quan Nguyen,Quang-Huy Pham,K.

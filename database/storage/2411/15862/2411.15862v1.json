However, because it also introduces slower\ninference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted\nto use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the\nintermediate steps. But there is still gap between their efficacy and typical\nexplicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really\nequal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question\nthrough experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the\nmodel's hidden states when it is performing implicit CoT. The results\nsurprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps,\nsuggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step\nreasoning. Moreover, we find LLMs' implicit reasoning capabilities are\nsusceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to\neffectively support complex tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u773e\u6240\u5468\u77e5\uff0c\u601d\u60f3\u93c8\u53ef\u4ee5\u986f\u8457\u589e\u5f37 LLM \u5728\u8907\u96dc\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5b83\u9084\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u8f03\u6162\u7684\u63a8\u8ad6\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8f03\u9ad8\u7684\u8a08\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5617\u8a66\u4f7f\u7528\u96b1\u5f0f CoT\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u9700\u8981 LLM \u660e\u78ba\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9593\u6b65\u9a5f\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u8207\u5178\u578b\u7684\u986f\u5f0f CoT \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u9593\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9019\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u500b\u7591\u554f\uff0c\u96b1\u5f0f CoT \u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u7b49\u65bc\u986f\u5f0f CoT\uff1f\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u9a57\u4f86\u63a2\u8a0e\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u57f7\u884c\u96b1\u5f0f CoT \u6642\uff0c\u63a2\u8a0e\u5176\u96b1\u85cf\u72c0\u614b\u4e2d\u95dc\u65bc\u4e2d\u9593\u6b65\u9a5f\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\u5730\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM \u5e7e\u4e4e\u4e0d\u6703\u8003\u616e\u4e2d\u9593\u6b65\u9a5f\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u50c5\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u7d93\u9a57\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u56b4\u683c\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe LLM \u7684\u96b1\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u518d\u6b21\u80af\u5b9a\u4e86\u986f\u5f0f CoT \u5728\u6709\u6548\u652f\u63f4\u8907\u96dc\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "author": "Yijiong Yu et.al.", "authors": "Yijiong Yu", "id": "2411.15862v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15862v1", "repo": "null"}}

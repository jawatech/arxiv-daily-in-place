Recently, the focus has expanded to the developmental\nalignment of these models: identifying phases during training where\nimprovements in model performance track improvements in children's thinking\nover development. However, there are many challenges to the use of PLMs as\ncognitive science theories, including different architectures, different\ntraining data modalities and scales, and limited model interpretability. In\nthis paper, we distill lessons learned from treating PLMs, not as engineering\nartifacts but as cognitive science and developmental science models. We review\nassumptions used by researchers to map measures of PLM performance to measures\nof human performance. We identify potential pitfalls of this approach to\nunderstanding human thinking, and we end by enumerating criteria for using PLMs\nas credible accounts of cognition and cognitive development.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (PLM) \u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u5373\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u8a8d\u77e5\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u8207\u6210\u4eba\u8868\u73fe\u7684\u5c0d\u61c9\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u7126\u9ede\u5df2\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff1a\u8b58\u5225\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u7684\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73fe\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u8ffd\u8e64\u5152\u7ae5\u601d\u7dad\u5728\u767c\u5c55\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c07 PLM \u7528\u4f5c\u8a8d\u77e5\u79d1\u5b78\u7406\u8ad6\u5b58\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u6578\u64da\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u898f\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u5c07 PLM \u8996\u70ba\u8a8d\u77e5\u79d1\u5b78\u548c\u767c\u5c55\u79d1\u5b78\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5de5\u7a0b\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u4e2d\u5438\u53d6\u6559\u8a13\u3002\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u7528\u65bc\u5c07 PLM \u6548\u80fd\u6e2c\u91cf\u5c0d\u61c9\u5230\u4eba\u985e\u6548\u80fd\u6e2c\u91cf\u7684\u5047\u8a2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8b58\u5225\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u985e\u601d\u7dad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e26\u6700\u5f8c\u5217\u8209\u4e86\u5c07 PLM \u7528\u4f5c\u8a8d\u77e5\u548c\u8a8d\u77e5\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8aaa\u660e\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u3002", "author": "Raj Sanjay Shah et.al.", "authors": "Raj Sanjay Shah, Sashank Varma", "id": "2501.12651v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12651v1", "repo": "null"}}

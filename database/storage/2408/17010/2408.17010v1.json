This issue can\nbe mitigated by employing strategies that prevent the model from becoming\noverly confident in its predictions, such as label smoothing and confidence\npenalty. Building upon the concept of label smoothing, we propose a novel\napproach to generate more reliable soft labels, which we refer to as\nrepresentation soft label smoothing. We apply label smoothing, confidence\npenalty, and our method representation soft label smoothing to several TSC\nmodels and compare their performance with baseline method which only uses hard\nlabels for training. Our results demonstrate that the use of these enhancement\ntechniques yields competitive results compared to the baseline method.\nImportantly, our method demonstrates strong performance across models with\nvarying structures and complexities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6642\u5e8f\u5206\u985e (TSC) \u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u904e\u5ea6\u64ec\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u53ef\u900f\u904e\u63a1\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u7de9\u89e3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u5176\u9810\u6e2c\u904e\u65bc\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u61f2\u7f70\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8edf\u6a19\u7c64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u8868\u793a\u5f0f\u8edf\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u4fe1\u5fc3\u61f2\u7f70\u548c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f0f\u8edf\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u500b TSC \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u8207\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u6a19\u7c64\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u57fa\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u589e\u5f37\u6280\u8853\u53ef\u7522\u751f\u5177\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7d50\u69cb\u548c\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Hengyi Ma et.al.", "authors": "Hengyi Ma, Weitong Chen", "id": "2408.17010v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17010v1", "repo": "null"}}

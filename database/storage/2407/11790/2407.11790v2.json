Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN\nmodel parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a\ntime-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training,\nit is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and\npatterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In\nthis study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two\nmainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU\ndistributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the\nperformance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training\nscenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware\nperspectives.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7531\u65bc\u7570\u8cea\u5716\u5f62\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (HGNN) \u5c0d\u7570\u8cea\u5716\u5f62\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u8a31\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u548c\u91ab\u7642\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u4f86\u627e\u51fa\u91dd\u5c0d\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\u7684\u6700\u4f73 HGNN \u6a21\u578b\u53c3\u6578\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8017\u6642\u4e14\u6602\u8cb4\u7684\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8 HGNN \u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5fc5\u9808\u5c0d\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u57f7\u884c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u7279\u5fb5\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u6548\u80fd\u74f6\u9838\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u6d41 HGNN \u8a13\u7df4\u5834\u666f\u9032\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u55ae\u4e00 GPU \u548c\u591a GPU \u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u6839\u64da\u7279\u5fb5\u5316\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63ed\u9732\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c HGNN \u8a13\u7df4\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u74f6\u9838\u53ca\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e26\u5f9e\u8edf\u9ad4\u548c\u786c\u9ad4\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6e96\u5247\u3002", "author": "Dengke Han et.al.", "authors": "Dengke Han, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Ninghui Sun", "id": "2407.11790v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11790v2", "repo": "null"}}

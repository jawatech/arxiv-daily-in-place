Explainable Alignments via Projections", "paper_summary": "Alignments are a well-known process mining technique for reconciling system\nlogs and normative process models. Evidence of certain behaviors in a real\nsystem may only be present in one representation - either a log or a model -\nbut not in the other. Since for processes in which multiple entities, like\nobjects and resources, are involved in the activities, their interactions\naffect the behavior and are therefore essential to take into account in the\nalignments.\n  Additionally, both logged and modeled representations of reality may be\nimprecise and only partially represent some of these entities, but not all. In\nthis paper, we introduce the concept of \"relaxations\" through projections for\nalignments to deal with partially correct models and logs. Relaxed alignments\nhelp to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy content of the two\nrepresentations (the log and the model) to achieve a better understanding of\nthe underlying process and expose quality issues.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u9f4a\u662f\u8abf\u548c\u7cfb\u7d71\u7d00\u9304\u548c\u898f\u7bc4\u6d41\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u540d\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a2\u52d8\u6280\u8853\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u8b49\u64da\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u5b58\u5728\u65bc\u4e00\u500b\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7d00\u9304\u6216\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5728\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u500b\u5be6\u9ad4\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7269\u4ef6\u548c\u8cc7\u6e90\uff09\u6703\u53c3\u8207\u6d3b\u52d5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5c0d\u9f4a\u6642\u5fc5\u9808\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u7d0d\u5165\u8003\u91cf\u3002\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73fe\u5be6\u7684\u8a18\u9304\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7cbe\u78ba\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u793a\u9019\u4e9b\u5be6\u9ad4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u90e8\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u300c\u653e\u9b06\u300d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8655\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u78ba\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7d00\u9304\u7684\u5c0d\u9f4a\u3002\u653e\u9b06\u5c0d\u9f4a\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u5340\u5206\u5169\u500b\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff08\u7d00\u9304\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8cf4\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u8cf4\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u790e\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e26\u63ed\u9732\u54c1\u8cea\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Dominique Sommers et.al.", "authors": "Dominique Sommers, Natalia Sidorova, Boudewijn van Dongen", "id": "2501.14360v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14360v1", "repo": "null"}}

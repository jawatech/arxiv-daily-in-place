Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering", "paper_summary": "Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated\nimpressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations\nof test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should\nalways give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about\nwhether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to\nalways provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence\nscores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that\nincreasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more\nquestions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We\nthen extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by\nconsidering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a\nrecipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u64f4\u5145\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u6642\u9593\u904b\u7b97\u5df2\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u6642\u9593\u64f4\u5145\u8a55\u4f30\u6703\u505a\u51fa\u5f37\u70c8\u7684\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u8a8d\u70ba\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\u61c9\u59cb\u7d42\u5c0d\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u554f\u984c\u7d66\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u9019\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u95dc\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5c0d\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u9069\u7576\u59cb\u7d42\u63d0\u4f9b\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u7591\u616e\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u7591\u616e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u9593\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5206\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a2d\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u95be\u503c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u589e\u52a0\u904b\u7b97\u9810\u7b97\u4e0d\u50c5\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u78ba\u56de\u7b54\u66f4\u591a\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u9084\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5c0d\u6b63\u78ba\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u8003\u616e\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u56de\u61c9\u98a8\u96aa\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff0c\u64f4\u5145\u8a55\u4f30\u671f\u9593\u96f6\u98a8\u96aa\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u73fe\u884c\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e26\u5efa\u8b70\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5831\u544a\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "author": "William Jurayj et.al.", "authors": "William Jurayj, Jeffrey Cheng, Benjamin Van Durme", "id": "2502.13962v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13962v1", "repo": "null"}}

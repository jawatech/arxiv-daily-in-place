Resonance is an\nAI-powered journaling tool designed to augment this ability by offering\nAI-generated, action-oriented suggestions for future activities based on the\nuser's own past memories. Suggestions are offered when a new memory is logged\nand are followed by a prompt for the user to imagine carrying out the\nsuggestion. In a two-week randomized controlled study (N=55), we found that\nusing Resonance significantly improved mental health outcomes, reducing the\nusers' PHQ8 scores, a measure of current depression, and increasing their daily\npositive affect, particularly when they would likely act on the suggestion.\nNotably, the effectiveness of the suggestions was higher when they were\npersonal, novel, and referenced the user's logged memories. Finally, through\nopen-ended feedback, we discuss the factors that encouraged or hindered the use\nof the tool.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5011\u5929\u751f\u5c31\u6703\u5229\u7528\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u7d93\u9a57\u4f86\u60f3\u50cf\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u672a\u4f86\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002Resonance \u662f\u4e00\u6b3eAI \u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u65e5\u8a18\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u900f\u904e\u6839\u64da\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u904e\u5f80\u8a18\u61b6\u63d0\u4f9b AI \u751f\u6210\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u884c\u52d5\u70ba\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u6d3b\u52d5\u5efa\u8b70\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u9019\u7a2e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7576\u8a18\u9304\u65b0\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u6642\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u6703\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8b70\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u60f3\u50cf\u57f7\u884c\u8a72\u5efa\u8b70\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u9805\u70ba\u671f\u5169\u9031\u7684\u96a8\u6a5f\u5c0d\u7167\u7814\u7a76 (N=55) \u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u4f7f\u7528 Resonance \u80fd\u986f\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684 PHQ8 \u5206\u6578\uff08\u4e00\u7a2e\u8861\u91cf\u7576\u524d\u6291\u9b31\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6a19\uff09\uff0c\u4e26\u589e\u52a0\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u6b63\u9762\u60c5\u7dd2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4ed6\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u6309\u7167\u5efa\u8b70\u63a1\u53d6\u884c\u52d5\u6642\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7576\u5efa\u8b70\u5177\u6709\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u3001\u65b0\u7a4e\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53c3\u8003\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8a18\u9304\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u6642\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u6703\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u56de\u994b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u4fc3\u9032\u6216\u963b\u7919\u8a72\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n", "author": "Wazeer Zulfikar et.al.", "authors": "Wazeer Zulfikar, Treyden Chiaravalloti, Jocelyn Shen, Rosalind Picard, Pattie Maes", "id": "2503.24145v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24145v1", "repo": "null"}}

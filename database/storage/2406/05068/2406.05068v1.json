Thus, over the last years, many methods to provide\nhuman-understandable explanations have been proposed. For image classification,\nthe most common group are saliency methods, which provide (super-)pixelwise\nfeature attribution scores for input images. But their evaluation still poses a\nproblem, as their results cannot be simply compared to the unknown ground\ntruth. To overcome this, a slew of different proxy metrics have been defined,\nwhich are - as the explainability methods themselves - often built on intuition\nand thus, are possibly unreliable. In this paper, new evaluation metrics for\nsaliency methods are developed and common saliency methods are benchmarked on\nImageNet. In addition, a scheme for reliability evaluation of such metrics is\nproposed that is based on concepts from psychometric testing.

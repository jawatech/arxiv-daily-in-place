High uncertainty caused by unknown opponents' strategies and dynamic\nobstacles complicates the action space into a hybrid decision process. Although\nthe deep reinforcement learning method is significant for swarm confrontation\nsince it can handle various sizes, as an end-to-end implementation, it cannot\ndeal with the hybrid process. Here, we propose a novel hierarchical\nreinforcement learning approach consisting of a target allocation layer, a path\nplanning layer, and the underlying dynamic interaction mechanism between the\ntwo layers, which indicates the quantified uncertainty. It decouples the hybrid\nprocess into discrete allocation and continuous planning layers, with a\nprobabilistic ensemble model to quantify the uncertainty and regulate the\ninteraction frequency adaptively. Furthermore, to overcome the unstable\ntraining process introduced by the two layers, we design an integration\ntraining method including pre-training and cross-training, which enhances the\ntraining efficiency and stability. Experiment results in both comparison and\nablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of\nour proposed approach.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u7fa4\u9ad4\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5b78\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0d\u6297\u5305\u62ec\u8ffd\u9010\u8ff4\u907f\u904a\u6232\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u60c5\u5883\u3002\u7531\u672a\u77e5\u5c0d\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u52d5\u614b\u969c\u7919\u7269\u6240\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6975\u5927\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u8907\u96dc\u5316\u70ba\u6df7\u5408\u6c7a\u7b56\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c0d\u65bc\u7fa4\u9ad4\u5c0d\u6297\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8655\u7406\u5404\u7a2e\u898f\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u70ba\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5be6\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b83\u7121\u6cd5\u8655\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u9019\u88e1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5c64\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6a19\u5206\u914d\u5c64\u3001\u8def\u5f91\u898f\u5283\u5c64\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5169\u5c64\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u52d5\u614b\u4e92\u52d5\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5c07\u6df7\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89e3\u8026\u70ba\u96e2\u6563\u5206\u914d\u548c\u9023\u7e8c\u898f\u5283\u5c64\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u6a5f\u7387\u6574\u9ad4\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u5730\u8abf\u6574\u4e92\u52d5\u983b\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u5169\u5c64\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u8a13\u7df4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6574\u5408\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u9019\u80fd\u589e\u5f37\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6bd4\u8f03\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Qizhen Wu et.al.", "authors": "Qizhen Wu, Kexin Liu, Lei Chen, Jinhu L\u00fc", "id": "2406.07877v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07877v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2405.10150": {"publish_time": "2024-05-16", "title": "Speaker Verification in Agent-Generated Conversations", "paper_summary": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted widespread\ninterest to develop role-playing conversational agents personalized to the\ncharacteristics and styles of different speakers to enhance their abilities to\nperform both general and special purpose dialogue tasks. However, the ability\nto personalize the generated utterances to speakers, whether conducted by human\nor LLM, has not been well studied. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a\nnovel evaluation challenge: speaker verification in agent-generated\nconversations, which aimed to verify whether two sets of utterances originate\nfrom the same speaker. To this end, we assemble a large dataset collection\nencompassing thousands of speakers and their utterances. We also develop and\nevaluate speaker verification models under experiment setups. We further\nutilize the speaker verification models to evaluate the personalization\nabilities of LLM-based role-playing models. Comprehensive experiments suggest\nthat the current role-playing models fail in accurately mimicking speakers,\nprimarily due to their inherent linguistic characteristics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4ee5\u958b\u767c\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5c0d\u8a71\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u98a8\u683c\u9032\u884c\u500b\u4eba\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u4ed6\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u7531\u4eba\u985e\u6216 LLM \u9032\u884c\uff0c\u5c07\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u70ba\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5f4c\u88dc\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u6311\u6230\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5c0d\u8a71\u4e2d\u7684\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u9a57\u8b49\u5169\u7d44\u5c0d\u8a71\u662f\u5426\u4f86\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u500b\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f59\u7de8\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5927\u578b\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6578\u5343\u540d\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u53ca\u5176\u5c0d\u8a71\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u958b\u767c\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u9a57\u8b49\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u9a57\u8b49\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7d9c\u5408\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u7121\u6cd5\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u6a21\u4eff\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u7279\u5fb5\u3002", "author": "Yizhe Yang et.al.", "authors": "Yizhe Yang, Heyan Huang, Palakorn Achananuparp, Jing Jiang, Ee-Peng Lim", "id": "2405.10150v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10150v1", "repo": "null"}}

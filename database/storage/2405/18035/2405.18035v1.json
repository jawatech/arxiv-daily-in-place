With the emergence of large language models (LMs), recent\nstudies have proposed using fixed examples for instruction tuning to\nreformulate ABSA as a generation task. However, the performance is sensitive to\nthe selection of in-context examples; several retrieval methods are based on\nsurface similarity and are independent of the LM generative objective. This\nstudy proposes an instruction learning method with retrieval-based example\nranking for ABSA tasks. For each target sample, an LM was applied as a scorer\nto estimate the likelihood of the output given the input and a candidate\nexample as the prompt, and training examples were labeled as positive or\nnegative by ranking the scores. An alternating training schema is proposed to\ntrain both the retriever and LM. Instructional prompts can be constructed using\nhigh-quality examples. The LM is used for both scoring and inference, improving\nthe generation efficiency without incurring additional computational costs or\ntraining difficulties. Extensive experiments on three ABSA subtasks verified\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over\nvarious strong baseline models.

Many recent watermarking\ntechniques slightly modify the output probabilities of LMs to embed a signal in\nthe generated output that can later be detected. Since early proposals for text\nwatermarking, questions about their robustness to paraphrasing have been\nprominently discussed. Lately, some techniques are deliberately designed and\nclaimed to be robust to paraphrasing. However, such watermarking schemes do not\nadequately account for the ease with which they can be reverse-engineered. We\nshow that with access to only a limited number of generations from a black-box\nwatermarked model, we can drastically increase the effectiveness of\nparaphrasing attacks to evade watermark detection, thereby rendering the\nwatermark ineffective.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5011\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u64d4\u5fc3\u7db2\u8def\u4e0a\u5145\u65a5\u8457\u7531\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u78ba\u8a8d\u6587\u5b57\u662f\u5426\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u539f\u5247\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u8853\u6703\u8f15\u5fae\u4fee\u6539 LM \u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u6a5f\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u7522\u751f\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u8a0a\u865f\uff0c\u7a0d\u5f8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5075\u6e2c\u5230\u9019\u500b\u8a0a\u865f\u3002\u81ea\u5f9e\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u5b57\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u63d0\u6848\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0c\u95dc\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u6539\u5beb\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u554f\u984c\u4e00\u76f4\u5099\u53d7\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u7d93\u904e\u523b\u610f\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u4e26\u8072\u7a31\u5c0d\u6539\u5beb\u5177\u6709\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u67b6\u69cb\u4e26\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u91cf\u5230\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f15\u9b06\u9032\u884c\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u53d6\u5f97\u9ed1\u76d2\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u4e16\u4ee3\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c31\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6539\u5beb\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u898f\u907f\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u5075\u6e2c\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u8b93\u6d6e\u6c34\u5370\u5931\u6548\u3002", "author": "Saksham Rastogi et.al.", "authors": "Saksham Rastogi, Danish Pruthi", "id": "2411.05277v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05277v1", "repo": "null"}}

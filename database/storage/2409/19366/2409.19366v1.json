However, in clinical practice, certain modalities of MRI may be\nmissing, which presents an even more difficult scenario. To cope with this\nchallenge, knowledge distillation has emerged as one promising strategy.\nHowever, recent efforts typically overlook the modality gaps and thus fail to\nlearn invariant feature representations across different modalities. Such\ndrawback consequently leads to limited performance for both teachers and\nstudents. To ameliorate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel\nparadigm that aligns latent features of involved modalities to a well-defined\ndistribution anchor. As a major contribution, we prove that our novel training\nparadigm ensures a tight evidence lower bound, thus theoretically certifying\nits effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbones validate that\nthe proposed paradigm can enable invariant feature representations and produce\na teacher with narrowed modality gaps. This further offers superior guidance\nfor missing modality students, achieving an average improvement of 1.75 on dice\nscore.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8166\u816b\u7624\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u65bc\u591a\u7a2e\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u5f71\u50cf (MRI)\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b MRI \u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u69cb\u6210\u66f4\u56f0\u96e3\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u6b64\u4e00\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u9805\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7121\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u8b8a\u7279\u5fb5\u8868\u793a\u3002\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\u5c0e\u81f4\u6559\u5e2b\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u5169\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6709\u9650\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c07\u76f8\u95dc\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7279\u5fb5\u8207\u660e\u78ba\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9328\u9ede\u5c0d\u9f4a\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u5927\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u65b0\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\u78ba\u4fdd\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u8b49\u64da\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u7406\u8ad6\u4e0a\u8b49\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9aa8\u5e79\u4e0a\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u80fd\u5920\u555f\u7528\u4e0d\u8b8a\u7279\u5fb5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e26\u7522\u751f\u65b9\u5f0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u7e2e\u5c0f\u7684\u6559\u5e2b\u3002\u9019\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u70ba\u907a\u5931\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u512a\u7570\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\uff0c\u5728\u9ab0\u5b50\u5206\u6578\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347 1.75\u3002", "author": "Tianyi Liu et.al.", "authors": "Tianyi Liu, Zhaorui Tan, Haochuan Jiang, Xi Yang, Kaizhu Huang", "id": "2409.19366v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19366v1", "repo": "null"}}

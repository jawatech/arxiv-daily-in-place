These LLMs are fine-tuned with specialized\nprompts to diagnose, explain, and suggest therapeutic interventions for\ndepression. A unique few-shot prompting method enhances the models' ability to\nanalyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM-5 criteria. In the\ninteraction phase, the models engage in empathetic dialogue management, drawing\nfrom resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide,\nfostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major\ndepressive disorders. Additionally, the research introduces the Illuminate\nDatabase, enriched with various CBT modules, aiding in personalized therapy\nrecommendations. The study evaluates LLM performance using metrics such as F1\nscores, Precision, Recall, Cosine similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy\nfor Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) across different test sets, demonstrating their\neffectiveness. This comprehensive approach blends cutting-edge AI with\nestablished psychological methods, offering new possibilities in mental health\ncare and showcasing the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing depression\ndiagnosis and treatment strategies.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Aryan Agrawal et.al.", "authors": "Aryan Agrawal", "id": "2402.05127v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05127v1", "repo": "null"}}

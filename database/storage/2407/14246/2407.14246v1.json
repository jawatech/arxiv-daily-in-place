Unipa-GPT relies\non gpt-3.5-turbo, it was presented in the context of the European Researchers'\nNight (SHARPER night). In our experiments we adopted both the Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) approach and fine-tuning to develop the system. The\nwhole architecture of Unipa-GPT is presented, both the RAG and the fine-tuned\nsystems are compared, and a brief discussion on their performance is reported.\nFurther comparison with other Large Language Models and the experimental\nresults during the SHARPER night are illustrated.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86 Unipa-GPT \u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u548c\u8a13\u7df4\uff0cUnipa-GPT \u662f\u4e00\u500b\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5354\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u9078\u64c7\u5df4\u52d2\u83ab\u5927\u5b78\u7684\u5b78\u58eb/\u78a9\u58eb\u5b78\u4f4d\u8ab2\u7a0b\u3002Unipa-GPT \u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc gpt-3.5-turbo\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5728\u6b50\u6d32\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u4e4b\u591c\uff08SHARPER \u4e4b\u591c\uff09\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u4e86\u6aa2\u7d22\u64f4\u5145\u751f\u6210 (RAG) \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5fae\u8abf\u4f86\u958b\u767c\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002Unipa-GPT \u7684\u6574\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\u90fd\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\uff0cRAG \u548c\u5fae\u8abf\u7cfb\u7d71\u90fd\u5df2\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u4e26\u7c21\u8981\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c SHARPER \u4e4b\u591c\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "author": "Irene Siragusa et.al.", "authors": "Irene Siragusa, Roberto Pirrone", "id": "2407.14246v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14246v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, they sometimes fail to outperform\nmuch simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive\ncharacteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why\nthese UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we\npropose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that\nleads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach\nacross a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive\nsummarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over\nstate-of-the-art UQ approaches.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316 (UQ) \u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u5404\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5169\u7a2e\u4e3b\u8981\u985e\u578b\u7279\u5225\u7a81\u51fa\uff1a\u57fa\u65bc\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u6b0a\u6756\u6a5f\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u65bc\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u8a55\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8907\u62bd\u6a23\u7522\u751f\u7684\u591a\u500b\u8f38\u51fa\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e7e\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u6642\u7121\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u6a5f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7368\u7279\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u89e3\u91cb\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u9019\u4e9b UQ \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u6839\u64da\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u548c\u8f38\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a69\u5065\u7684 UQ \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u8a55\u4f30\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u554f\u7b54\u3001\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c0d\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 UQ \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u986f\u8457\u6539\u9032\u3002", "author": "Roman Vashurin et.al.", "authors": "Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov", "id": "2502.04964v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04964v1", "repo": "null"}}

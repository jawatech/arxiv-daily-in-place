The\nprevalence of errors in CXR diagnoses, particularly among inexperienced\nradiologists and hospital residents, underscores the importance of\nunderstanding radiologists' intentions and the corresponding regions of\ninterest. This understanding is crucial for correcting mistakes by guiding\nradiologists to the accurate regions of interest, especially in the diagnosis\nof chest radiograph abnormalities. In response to this imperative, we propose a\nnovel system designed to identify the primary intentions articulated by\nradiologists in their reports and the corresponding regions of interest in CXR\nimages. This system seeks to elucidate the visual context underlying\nradiologists' textual findings, with the potential to rectify errors made by\nless experienced practitioners and direct them to precise regions of interest.\nImportantly, the proposed system can be instrumental in providing constructive\nfeedback to inexperienced radiologists or junior residents in the hospital,\nbridging the gap in face-to-face communication. The system represents a\nvaluable tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and fostering continuous\nlearning within the medical community.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Akash Awasthi et.al.", "authors": "Akash Awasthi,Safwan Ahmad,Bryant Le,Hien Van Nguyen", "id": "2404.18981v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18981v1", "repo": "null"}}

We\ninvestigate the performance of a language model trained on the Stanford Natural\nLanguage Inference (SNLI) corpus on a manually created adversarial test set. We\nthen improve the model's performance by fine tuning the model on a small,\nmanually created adversarial training set, designed to help the language model\nto learn to differentiate between similar words and phrases in the data. We\nshow an increase in accuracy on the adversarial test set (+ 13%) while still\nmaintaining good performance on the original NLI task. We also show an increase\nin accuracy from 91.2% to 92.9% on the most similar contradictions in the SNLI\ntest set (as judged by cosine similarity).", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 NLI\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9054\u5230\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u7bc4\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6e2c\u8a66\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u5728 Stanford \u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u63a8\u7406 (SNLI) \u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7684\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5fae\u8abf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f86\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u6b64\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u65e8\u5728\u5e6b\u52a9\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b78\u7fd2\u5340\u5206\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u985e\u4f3c\u7684\u5b57\u8a5e\u548c\u7247\u8a9e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\u5728\u5c0d\u6297\u6e2c\u8a66\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff08+ 13%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5728\u539f\u59cb NLI \u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u7dad\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u986f\u793a\u5728 SNLI \u6e2c\u8a66\u96c6\u4e2d\u6700\u985e\u4f3c\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5f9e 91.2% \u63d0\u5347\u5230 92.9%\uff08\u4f9d\u64da\u9918\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5224\u65b7\uff09\u3002", "author": "Chris Achard et.al.", "authors": "Chris Achard", "id": "2410.23118v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23118v1", "repo": "null"}}

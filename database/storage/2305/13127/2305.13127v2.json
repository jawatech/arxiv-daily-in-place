An Interpretable AI Approach for Depression Detection in Social Media", "paper_summary": "Depression is the most prevalent and serious mental illness, which induces\ngrave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for\nearly intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision\ninherently necessitates interpretability. Although a few depression detection\nstudies attempt to explain the decision based on the importance score or\nattention weights, these explanations misalign with the clinical depression\ndiagnosis criterion that is based on depressive symptoms. To fill this gap, we\nfollow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel Multi-Scale\nTemporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet innovatively detects and\ninterprets depressive symptoms as well as how long they last. Extensive\nempirical analyses using a large-scale dataset show that MSTPNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art depression detection methods with an F1-score of 0.851. This\nresult also reveals new symptoms that are unnoted in the survey approach, such\nas sharing admiration for a different life. We further conduct a user study to\ndemonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study\ncontributes to IS literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for\ndepression detection in social media. In practice, our proposed method can be\nimplemented in social media platforms to provide personalized online resources\nfor detected depressed patients.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Junwei Kuang et.al.", "authors": "Junwei Kuang,Jiaheng Xie,Zhijun Yan", "id": "2305.13127v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13127v2", "repo": "null"}}

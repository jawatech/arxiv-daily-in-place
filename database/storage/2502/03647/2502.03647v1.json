We replicate these results for authorship and extend\nthem to a new dataset measuring novel genre. We find that LLMs are able to\ndistinguish authorship and genre, but they do so in different ways. Some models\nseem to rely more on memorization, while others benefit more from training to\nlearn author/genre characteristics. We then use three methods to probe one\nhigh-performing LLM for features that define style. These include direct\nsyntactic ablations to input text as well as two methods that look at model\ninternals. We find that authorial style is easier to define than genre-level\nstyle and is more impacted by minor syntactic decisions and contextual word\nusage. However, some traits like pronoun usage and word order prove significant\nfor defining both kinds of literary style.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4ee5\u8b58\u5225\u6bd4\u50b3\u7d71\u6587\u9ad4\u6e2c\u91cf\u6cd5\u8a8d\u70ba\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66f4\u77ed\u6587\u5b78\u6bb5\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8907\u88fd\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u5206\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u6e2c\u91cf\u65b0\u5c0f\u8aaa\u985e\u578b\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe LLM \u80fd\u5920\u5340\u5206\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u5206\u548c\u985e\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u505a\u5230\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u4e4e\u66f4\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u8a18\u61b6\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5247\u5f9e\u8a13\u7df4\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f5c\u8005/\u985e\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u63a2\u67e5\u4e00\u500b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd LLM \u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u5b9a\u7fa9\u98a8\u683c\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5c0d\u8f38\u5165\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u53e5\u6cd5\u6d88\u878d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u67e5\u770b\u6a21\u578b\u5167\u90e8\u7684\u5169\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u98a8\u683c\u6bd4\u985e\u578b\u5c64\u7d1a\u98a8\u683c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53d7\u5230\u8f03\u5c0f\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u6c7a\u7b56\u548c\u8a9e\u5883\u8a5e\u5f59\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5fb5\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u540d\u8a5e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8a5e\u5e8f\uff09\u5c0d\u65bc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u6587\u5b78\u98a8\u683c\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "author": "Rebecca M.

In Edge-AI, federated continual\nlearning (FCL) has emerged as an imperative framework, which fuses knowledge\nfrom different clients while preserving data privacy and retaining knowledge\nfrom previous tasks as it learns new ones. By so doing, FCL aims to ensure\nstable and reliable performance of learning models in dynamic and distributed\nenvironments. In this survey, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art\nresearch and present the first comprehensive survey of FCL for Edge-AI. We\ncategorize FCL methods based on three task characteristics: federated class\ncontinual learning, federated domain continual learning, and federated task\ncontinual learning. For each category, an in-depth investigation and review of\nthe representative methods are provided, covering background, challenges,\nproblem formalisation, solutions, and limitations. Besides, existing real-world\napplications empowered by FCL are reviewed, indicating the current progress and\npotential of FCL in diverse application domains. Furthermore, we discuss and\nhighlight several prospective research directions of FCL such as\nalgorithm-hardware co-design for FCL and FCL with foundation models, which\ncould provide insights into the future development and practical deployment of\nFCL in the era of Edge-AI.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u908a\u7de3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08Edge-AI\uff09\u662f\u908a\u7de3\u904b\u7b97\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08AI\uff09\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\n\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9760\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u908a\u7de3\u90e8\u7f72\u9032\u968e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728 Edge-AI \u4e2d\uff0c\u806f\u90a6\u6301\u7e8c\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08FCL\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5b83\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u4f86\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6236\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\u6642\u4fdd\u8b77\u8cc7\u6599\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u900f\u904e\u9019\u6a23\u505a\uff0cFCL \u65e8\u5728\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52d5\u614b\u4e14\u5206\u6563\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7a69\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6b21\u8abf\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5fb9\u5e95\u6aa2\u8996\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 FCL \u5728 Edge-AI \u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4efd\u5168\u9762\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u4e09\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u7279\u6027\u5c0d FCL \u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\uff1a\u806f\u90a6\u985e\u5225\u6301\u7e8c\u5b78\u7fd2\u3001\u806f\u90a6\u9818\u57df\u6301\u7e8c\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u806f\u90a6\u4efb\u52d9\u6301\u7e8c\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u6bcf\u500b\u985e\u5225\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u8abf\u67e5\u548c\u56de\u9867\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u6311\u6230\u3001\u554f\u984c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u7531 FCL \u8ce6\u80fd\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86 FCL \u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u61c9\u7528\u9818\u57df\u7684\u7576\u524d\u9032\u5ea6\u548c\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86 FCL \u7684\u5e7e\u500b\u6f5b\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 FCL \u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u786c\u9ad4\u5171\u540c\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u5177\u5099\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\u7684 FCL\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c0d FCL \u5728 Edge-AI \u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u767c\u5c55\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002", "author": "Zi Wang et.al.", "authors": "Zi Wang, Fei Wu, Feng Yu, Yurui Zhou, Jia Hu, Geyong Min", "id": "2411.13740v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13740v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2405.17846": {"publish_time": "2024-05-28", "title": "Safety Control of Service Robots with LLMs and Embodied Knowledge Graphs", "paper_summary": "Safety limitations in service robotics across various industries have raised\nsignificant concerns about the need for robust mechanisms ensuring that robots\nadhere to safe practices, thereby preventing actions that might harm humans or\ncause property damage. Despite advances, including the integration of Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges in ensuring\nconsistent safety in autonomous robot actions persist. In this paper, we\npropose a novel integration of Large Language Models with Embodied Robotic\nControl Prompts (ERCPs) and Embodied Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) to enhance the\nsafety framework for service robots. ERCPs are designed as predefined\ninstructions that ensure LLMs generate safe and precise responses. These\nresponses are subsequently validated by EKGs, which provide a comprehensive\nknowledge base ensuring that the actions of the robot are continuously aligned\nwith safety protocols, thereby promoting safer operational practices in varied\ncontexts. Our experimental setup involved diverse real-world tasks, where\nrobots equipped with our framework demonstrated significantly higher compliance\nwith safety standards compared to traditional methods. This integration fosters\nsecure human-robot interactions and positions our methodology at the forefront\nof AI-driven safety innovations in service robotics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5404\u7522\u696d\u4e2d\u7684\u670d\u52d9\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u5df2\u5f15\u767c\u91cd\u5927\u7591\u616e\uff0c\u8a8d\u70ba\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5f37\u5065\u7684\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u9075\u5b88\u5b89\u5168\u898f\u7bc4\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u9632\u6b62\u53ef\u80fd\u50b7\u5bb3\u4eba\u985e\u6216\u9020\u6210\u8ca1\u7522\u640d\u5931\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c07\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u8207\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6230\u5b58\u5728\u65bc\u78ba\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u5c07\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8207\u5177\u9ad4\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a (ERCP) \u548c\u5177\u9ad4\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (EKG) \u9032\u884c\u5275\u65b0\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u670d\u52d9\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u69cb\u3002ERCP \u88ab\u8a2d\u8a08\u70ba\u9810\u5148\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u53ef\u78ba\u4fdd LLM \u7522\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u56de\u61c9\u96a8\u5f8c\u7531 EKG \u9a57\u8b49\uff0cEKG \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5eab\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u6301\u7e8c\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u5354\u5b9a\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u4fc3\u9032\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u904b\u4f5c\u5be6\u52d9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u7f6e\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u914d\u5099\u6211\u5011\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6a19\u6e96\u9075\u5faa\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u6574\u5408\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6280\u8853\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65bc\u670d\u52d9\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d AI \u9a45\u52d5\u5b89\u5168\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u524d\u7dda\u3002", "author": "Yong Qi et.al.", "authors": "Yong Qi, Gabriel Kyebambo, Siyuan Xie, Wei Shen, Shenghui Wang, Bitao Xie, Bin He, Zhipeng Wang, Shuo Jiang", "id": "2405.17846v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17846v1", "repo": "null"}}

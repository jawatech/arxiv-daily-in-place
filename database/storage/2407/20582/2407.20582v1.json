When a\nmirror segment becomes misaligned due to various environmental factors, such as\nspace debris, the images can become distorted with a shifted copy of itself\ncalled a \"ghost image\". To detect whether segments are misaligned, we use\npre-trained, large-scale image models trained on the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT) of patches of satellite images in grayscale. Multi-mirror designs can use\nany arbitrary number of mirrors. For our purposes, the tests were performed on\nsimulated CubeSats with 4, 6, and 8 segments. For system design, we took this\ninto account when we want to know when a satellite has a misaligned segment and\nhow many segments are misaligned. The intensity of the ghost image is directly\nproportional to the number of segments misaligned. Models trained for intensity\nclassification attempted to classify N-1 segments. Across eight classes, binary\nmodels were able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.75%, and models for\nintensity classification were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.05%.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u8f49\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6aa2\u6e2c\u591a\u93e1\u9762\u885b\u661f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u672a\u4f86\u7684 CubeSat \u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u97cb\u4f2f\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u9060\u93e1 (JWST)\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u932f\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u5716\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7576\u93e1\u6bb5\u7531\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u74b0\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u592a\u7a7a\u788e\u7247\uff09\u800c\u932f\u4f4d\u6642\uff0c\u5716\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u56e0\u5176\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u526f\u672c\uff08\u7a31\u70ba\u300c\u9b3c\u5f71\u300d\uff09\u800c\u5931\u771f\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6aa2\u6e2c\u5206\u6bb5\u662f\u5426\u932f\u4f4d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7070\u968e\u885b\u661f\u5716\u50cf\u88dc\u4e01\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u7acb\u8449\u8b8a\u63db (FFT) \u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u5716\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u591a\u93e1\u9762\u8a2d\u8a08\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6578\u91cf\u7684\u93e1\u9762\u3002\u5c31\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6e2c\u8a66\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u64ec\u7684 4\u30016 \u548c 8 \u6bb5 CubeSat \u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u7684\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u7cfb\u7d71\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u7576\u6211\u5011\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u885b\u661f\u4f55\u6642\u6709\u932f\u4f4d\u5206\u6bb5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u5206\u6bb5\u932f\u4f4d\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6703\u8003\u616e\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\u3002\u9b3c\u5f71\u7684\u5f37\u5ea6\u8207\u932f\u4f4d\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u6578\u91cf\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002\u70ba\u5f37\u5ea6\u5206\u985e\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5617\u8a66\u5c0d N-1 \u500b\u5206\u6bb5\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u3002\u5728\u516b\u500b\u985e\u5225\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u5be6\u73fe 98.75% \u7684\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5f37\u5ea6\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u5be6\u73fe 98.05% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "C.

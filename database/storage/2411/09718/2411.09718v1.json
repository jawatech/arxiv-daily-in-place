The number of required scans is growing and there is a shortage of\nqualified labor. AI solutions for medical imaging applications have shown great\npotential. However, very few diagnostic imaging models have been approved for\nhospital use and even fewer are being implemented at the hospitals. The most\ncommon reason why software projects fail is poor requirement engineering,\nespecially non-functional requirements (NFRs) can be detrimental to a project.\nResearch shows that machine learning professionals struggle to work with NFRs\nand that there is a need to adapt NFR frameworks to machine learning, AI-based,\nsoftware. This study uses qualitative methods to interact with key stakeholders\nto identify which types of NFRs are important for medical imaging applications.\nThe study was done on a single Danish hospital and found that NFRs of type\nEfficiency, Accuracy, Interoperability, Reliability, Usability, Adaptability,\nand Fairness were important to the stakeholders. Especially Efficiency since\nthe diagnostic imaging department is trying to spend as little time as possible\non each scan.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7531\u65bc\u5de5\u4f5c\u8ca0\u8f09\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8a3a\u65b7\u5f71\u50cf\u90e8\u9580\u627f\u53d7\u8457\u6975\u5927\u7684\u58d3\u529b\u3002\u6240\u9700\u6383\u63cf\u7684\u6578\u91cf\u6b63\u5728\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5408\u683c\u7684\u52de\u52d5\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u3002\u91ab\u7642\u5f71\u50cf\u61c9\u7528\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u8a3a\u65b7\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u6279\u51c6\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u9662\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u5c11\u88ab\u5be6\u65bd\u65bc\u91ab\u9662\u3002\u8edf\u9ad4\u5c08\u6848\u5931\u6557\u7684\u6700\u5e38\u898b\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42 (NFR) \u53ef\u80fd\u5c0d\u5c08\u6848\u6709\u5bb3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u96e3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528 NFR\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5c07 NFR \u6846\u67b6\u8abf\u6574\u70ba\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u3001\u57fa\u65bc AI \u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8207\u4e3b\u8981\u5229\u5bb3\u95dc\u4fc2\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u985e\u578b\u7684 NFR \u5c0d\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8a72\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e39\u9ea5\u91ab\u9662\u9032\u884c\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u985e\u578b\u7684 NFR \u5c0d\u5229\u5bb3\u95dc\u4fc2\u4eba\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u8a3a\u65b7\u5f71\u50cf\u90e8\u9580\u6b63\u52aa\u529b\u76e1\u53ef\u80fd\u6e1b\u5c11\u6bcf\u9805\u6383\u63cf\u6240\u82b1\u7684\u6642\u9593\u3002", "author": "Amanda Vallentin et.al.", "authors": "Amanda Vallentin", "id": "2411.09718v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09718v1", "repo": "null"}}

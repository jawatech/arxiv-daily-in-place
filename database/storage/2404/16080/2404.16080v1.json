It provides virtual\nhigh-resolution images of the skin and superficial tissues, reducing the need\nfor physical biopsies. RCM employs a laser light source to illuminate the\ntissue, capturing the reflected light to generate detailed images of\nmicroscopic structures at various depths. Recent studies explored AI and\nmachine learning, particularly CNNs, for analyzing RCM images. Our study\nproposes a segmentation strategy based on textural features to identify\nclinically significant regions, empowering dermatologists in effective image\ninterpretation and boosting diagnostic confidence. This approach promises to\nadvance dermatological diagnosis and treatment.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Hong-Jun Yoon et.al.", "authors": "Hong-Jun Yoon,Chris Keum,Alexander Witkowski,Joanna Ludzik,Tracy Petrie,Heidi A.

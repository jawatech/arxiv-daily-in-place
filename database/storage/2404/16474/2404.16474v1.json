However, the accuracy of the segmentation\nresults is often limited by insufficient supervision and the complex nature of\nmedical imaging. Existing models also only provide a single outcome, which does\nnot allow for the measurement of uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce\nDiffSeg, a segmentation model for skin lesions based on diffusion difference\nwhich exploits diffusion model principles to ex-tract noise-based features from\nimages with diverse semantic information. By discerning difference between\nthese noise features, the model identifies diseased areas. Moreover, its\nmulti-output capability mimics doctors' annotation behavior, facilitating the\nvisualization of segmentation result consistency and ambiguity. Additionally,\nit quantifies output uncertainty using Generalized Energy Distance (GED),\naiding interpretability and decision-making for physicians. Finally, the model\nintegrates outputs through the Dense Conditional Random Field (DenseCRF)\nalgorithm to refine the segmentation boundaries by considering inter-pixel\ncorrelations, which improves the accuracy and optimizes the segmentation\nresults. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffSeg on the ISIC 2018 Challenge\ndataset, outperforming state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Zhihao Shuai et.al.", "authors": "Zhihao Shuai,Yinan Chen,Shunqiang Mao,Yihan Zho,Xiaohong Zhang", "id": "2404.16474v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16474v1", "repo": "null"}}

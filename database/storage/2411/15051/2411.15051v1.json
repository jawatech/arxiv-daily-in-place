The use of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our society, and its\nimpact is growing everyday. The promises it holds strongly depend on their fair\nand universal use, such as access to information or education for all. In a\nworld of inequalities, they can help to reach the most disadvantaged areas.\nHowever, such a universal systems must be able to represent society, without\nbenefiting some at the expense of others. We must not reproduce the\ninequalities observed throughout the world, but educate these IAs to go beyond\nthem. We have seen cases where these systems use gender, race, or even class\ninformation in ways that are not appropriate for resolving their tasks. Instead\nof real causal reasoning, they rely on spurious correlations, which is what we\nusually call a bias. In this paper, we first attempt to define what is a bias\nin general terms. It helps us to demystify the concept of bias, to understand\nwhy we can find them everywhere and why they are sometimes useful. Second, we\nfocus over the notion of what is generally seen as negative bias, the one we\nwant to avoid in machine learning, before presenting a general zoology\ncontaining the most common of these biases. We finally conclude by looking at\nclassical methods to detect them, by means of specially crafted datasets of\ntemplates and specific algorithms, and also classical methods to mitigate them.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u5b78\u7fd2\u9f90\u5927\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u3002\n\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u73fe\u8c61\u5c31\u8d8a\u8907\u96dc\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\n\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u6211\u5011\u793e\u6703\u4e2d\u6b63\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b83\u7684\n\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u4e5f\u8207\u65e5\u4ff1\u589e\u3002\u5b83\u6240\u627f\u8afe\u7684\u627f\u8afe\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8b93\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u7372\u5f97\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6216\u6559\u80b2\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u63a5\u89f8\u5230\u6700\u5f31\u52e2\u7684\u5730\u5340\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u6a23\u4e00\u500b\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u5fc5\u9808\u80fd\u5920\u4ee3\u8868\u793e\u6703\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6703\u4ee5\u72a7\u7272\u4ed6\u4eba\u70ba\u4ee3\u50f9\u4f86\u4f7f\u67d0\u4e9b\u4eba\u53d7\u76ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e0d\u80fd\u8907\u88fd\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u73fe\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u5fc5\u9808\u6559\u80b2\u9019\u4e9b AI \u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u5011\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u7d93\u770b\u5230\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u4ee5\u4e0d\u9069\u7576\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u6027\u5225\u3001\u7a2e\u65cf\u751a\u81f3\u968e\u7d1a\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5176\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u865b\u5047\u7684\u95dc\u806f\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u6b63\u662f\u6211\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u6240\u8aaa\u7684\u504f\u898b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u5617\u8a66\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4ec0\u9ebc\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u610f\u7fa9\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u898b\u3002\u5b83\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u63ed\u958b\u504f\u898b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u795e\u79d8\u9762\u7d17\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u627e\u5230\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u6642\u662f\u6709\u7528\u7684\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u8ca0\u9762\u504f\u898b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u7684\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e00\u500b\u5305\u542b\u9019\u4e9b\u504f\u898b\u4e2d\u6700\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u504f\u898b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u52d5\u7269\u5b78\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u67e5\u770b\u5c08\u9580\u88fd\u4f5c\u7684\u7bc4\u672c\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6e1b\u8f15\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u7d93\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u6aa2\u8996\u5075\u6e2c\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u7d93\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Valentin Barriere et.al.", "authors": "Valentin Barriere", "id": "2411.15051v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15051v1", "repo": "null"}}

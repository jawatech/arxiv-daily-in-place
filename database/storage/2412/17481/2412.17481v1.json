However, with the continuous influx\nof new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them\ncomprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies.\nWe first discuss the definition of MGAS, a framework encompassing much of\nprevious work. We provide an overview of the various applications of MGAS in\n(i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii)\nevaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight\nseveral challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u4e16\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08MGAS\uff09\u81ea\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8208\u8d77\u4ee5\u4f86\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u71b1\u9ede\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u95dc\u65b0\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u6301\u7e8c\u6e67\u5165\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u8a55\u8ad6\u96e3\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u6db5\u84cb\u5b83\u5011\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86 MGAS \u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u6db5\u84cb\u8a31\u591a\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86 MGAS \u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u61c9\u7528\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u89e3\u6c7a\u8907\u96dc\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u6a21\u64ec\u7279\u5b9a\u5834\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff08iii\uff09\u8a55\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u5728\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u790e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5e7e\u500b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Shuaihang Chen et.al.", "authors": "Shuaihang Chen, Yuanxing Liu, Wei Han, Weinan Zhang, Ting Liu", "id": "2412.17481v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17481v1", "repo": "null"}}

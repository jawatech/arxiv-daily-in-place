{"2407.16514": {"publish_time": "2024-07-23", "title": "Is 3D Convolution with 5D Tensors Really Necessary for Video Analysis?", "paper_summary": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive study and propose several novel\ntechniques for implementing 3D convolutional blocks using 2D and/or 1D\nconvolutions with only 4D and/or 3D tensors. Our motivation is that 3D\nconvolutions with 5D tensors are computationally very expensive and they may\nnot be supported by some of the edge devices used in real-time applications\nsuch as robots. The existing approaches mitigate this by splitting the 3D\nkernels into spatial and temporal domains, but they still use 3D convolutions\nwith 5D tensors in their implementations. We resolve this issue by introducing\nsome appropriate 4D/3D tensor reshaping as well as new combination techniques\nfor spatial and temporal splits. The proposed implementation methods show\nsignificant improvement both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The\nexperimental results confirm that the proposed spatio-temporal processing\nstructure outperforms the original model in terms of speed and accuracy using\nonly 4D tensors with fewer parameters.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7e\u7a2e\u4f7f\u7528 2D \u548c/\u6216 1D \u6372\u7a4d\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528 4D \u548c/\u6216 3D \u5f35\u91cf\u4f86\u5be6\u73fe 3D \u6372\u7a4d\u584a\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u52d5\u6a5f\u662f 5D \u5f35\u91cf\u7684 3D \u6372\u7a4d\u5728\u8a08\u7b97\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u6602\u8cb4\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d7\u7528\u65bc\u5be6\u6642\u61c9\u7528\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u908a\u7de3\u8a2d\u5099\u652f\u6301\u3002\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u904e\u5c07 3D \u6838\u5fc3\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u7a7a\u9593\u548c\u6642\u9593\u57df\u4f86\u7de9\u89e3\u6b64\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5176\u5be6\u73fe\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u4f7f\u7528 5D \u5f35\u91cf\u7684 3D \u6372\u7a4d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e9b\u9069\u7576\u7684 4D/3D \u5f35\u91cf\u91cd\u5851\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u548c\u6642\u9593\u5206\u5272\u7d44\u5408\u6280\u8853\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5be6\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u5be6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6642\u7a7a\u8655\u7406\u7d50\u69cb\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u8f03\u5c11\u53c3\u6578\u7684 4D \u5f35\u91cf\u3002", "author": "Habib Hajimolahoseini et.al.", "authors": "Habib Hajimolahoseini, Walid Ahmed, Austin Wen, Yang Liu", "id": "2407.16514v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16514v1", "repo": "null"}}

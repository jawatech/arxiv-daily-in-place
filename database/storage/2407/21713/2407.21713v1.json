As children, we imitate our parents' speech patterns until we are\nable to produce sounds; we learn from them praising us and scolding us; and as\nadults, we learn by working with others. In this work, we survey the degree to\nwhich this paradigm -- social learning -- has been mirrored in machine\nlearning. In particular, since learning socially requires interacting with\nothers, we are interested in how embodied agents can and have utilised these\ntechniques. This is especially in light of the degree to which recent advances\nin natural language processing (NLP) enable us to perform new forms of social\nlearning. We look at how behavioural cloning and next-token prediction mirror\nhuman imitation, how learning from human feedback mirrors human education, and\nhow we can go further to enable fully communicative agents that learn from each\nother. We find that while individual social learning techniques have been used\nsuccessfully, there has been little unifying work showing how to bring them\ntogether into socially embodied agents.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u667a\u80fd\u767c\u5c55\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u8eab\u70ba\u5b69\u7ae5\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6a21\u4eff\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u8aaa\u8a71\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u767c\u51fa\u8072\u97f3\uff1b\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u8b9a\u7f8e\u8207\u8cac\u7f75\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\uff1b\u800c\u8eab\u70ba\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u8207\u4ed6\u4eba\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u5178\u7bc4\uff08\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\uff09\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u88ab\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u5225\u5730\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\u9700\u8981\u8207\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u4e86\u89e3\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u5920\u4e26\u5df2\u7d93\u5229\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u3002\u9019\u7279\u5225\u662f\u9451\u65bc\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u57f7\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u884c\u70ba\u8907\u88fd\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u4ee3\u5e63\u9810\u6e2c\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u985e\u6a21\u4eff\u3001\u5f9e\u4eba\u985e\u56de\u994b\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u985e\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5be6\u73fe\u80fd\u5920\u5f7c\u6b64\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6e9d\u901a\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u500b\u5225\u7684\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u5df2\u88ab\u6210\u529f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9bae\u5c11\u6709\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u5e36\u5165\u793e\u6703\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u3002", "author": "Dylan hillier et.al.", "authors": "Dylan hillier, Cheston Tan, Jing Jiang", "id": "2407.21713v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21713v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2501.02766": {"publish_time": "2025-01-06", "title": "Are GNNs Effective for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Microservice Systems?", "paper_summary": "Fault diagnosis in microservice systems has increasingly embraced multimodal\nobservation data for a holistic and multifaceted view of the system, with Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) commonly employed to model complex service dependencies.\nHowever, despite the intuitive appeal, there remains a lack of compelling\njustification for the adoption of GNNs, as no direct evidence supports their\nnecessity or effectiveness. To critically evaluate the current use of GNNs, we\npropose DiagMLP, a simple topology-agnostic baseline as a substitute for GNNs\nin fault diagnosis frameworks. Through experiments on five public datasets, we\nsurprisingly find that DiagMLP performs competitively with and even outperforms\nGNN-based methods in fault diagnosis tasks, indicating that the current\nparadigm of using GNNs to model service dependencies has not yet demonstrated a\ntangible contribution. We further discuss potential reasons for this\nobservation and advocate shifting the focus from solely pursuing novel model\ndesigns to developing challenging datasets, standardizing preprocessing\nprotocols, and critically evaluating the utility of advanced deep learning\nmodules.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8a3a\u65b7\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u63a1\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u89c0\u6e2c\u6578\u64da\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u800c\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u65bc\u5efa\u6a21\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u670d\u52d9\u4f9d\u8cf4\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u89c0\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a1\u7528 GNN \u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6c92\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u8b49\u64da\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u6216\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8a55\u4f30 GNN \u7684\u7576\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u6cc1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 DiagMLP\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u8207\u62d3\u64b2\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u6545\u969c\u8a3a\u65b7\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684 GNN\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5c0d\u4e94\u500b\u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9a5a\u8a1d\u5730\u767c\u73fe DiagMLP \u5728\u6545\u969c\u8a3a\u65b7\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u8207 GNN \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7af6\u722d\u751a\u81f3\u512a\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u7576\u524d\u4f7f\u7528 GNN \u4f86\u5efa\u6a21\u670d\u52d9\u4f9d\u8cf4\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5c1a\u672a\u8b49\u660e\u6709\u5177\u9ad4\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u89c0\u5bdf\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e26\u4e3b\u5f35\u5c07\u91cd\u9ede\u5f9e\u50c5\u8ffd\u6c42\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8a2d\u8a08\u8f49\u79fb\u5230\u958b\u767c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3001\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u9810\u8655\u7406\u5354\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8a55\u4f30\u9032\u968e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "author": "Fei Gao et.al.", "authors": "Fei Gao, Ruyue Xin, Yaqiang Zhang", "id": "2501.02766v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02766v1", "repo": "null"}}

A study of presuppositions in French and Italian political communication", "paper_summary": "This paper aims to provide a comparison between texts produced by French and\nItalian politicians on polarizing issues, such as immigration and the European\nUnion, and their chatbot counterparts created with ChatGPT 3.5. In this study,\nwe focus on implicit communication, in particular on presuppositions and their\nfunctions in discourse, which have been considered in the literature as a\npotential linguistic feature of manipulation. This study also aims to\ncontribute to the emerging literature on the pragmatic competences of Large\nLanguage Models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u570b\u548c\u7fa9\u5927\u5229\u653f\u6cbb\u4eba\u7269\u5728\u79fb\u6c11\u548c\u6b50\u76df\u7b49\u5169\u6975\u5206\u5316\u8b70\u984c\u4e0a\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528 ChatGPT 3.5 \u6240\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5c0d\u61c9\u7248\u672c\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u96b1\u542b\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u9810\u8a2d\u548c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8a71\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u64cd\u7e31\u8a9e\u8a00\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u65e8\u5728\u70ba\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a9e\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u9019\u9805\u65b0\u8208\u6587\u737b\u505a\u51fa\u8ca2\u737b\u3002", "author": "Davide Garassino et.al.", "authors": "Davide Garassino, Vivana Masia, Nicola Brocca, Alice Delorme Benites", "id": "2411.18403v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18403v1", "repo": "null"}}

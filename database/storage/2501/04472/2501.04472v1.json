Methods: The navigation module\ncombines a deep learning model with a rule-based engine depending on the agent\nstate. The deep learning model has been trained using reinforcement learning.\nThe rule-based engine uses expert knowledge to deal with specific situations.\nThe navigation module incorporates several strategies to explain the drone\ndecision based on its observation space, and different mechanisms for including\nhuman decisions in the navigation process. Finally, this paper proposes an\nevaluation methodology based on defining several scenarios and analyzing the\nperformance of the different strategies according to metrics adapted to each\nscenario. Results: Two main navigation problems have been studied. For the\nfirst scenario (reaching known targets), it has been possible to obtain a 90%\ntask completion rate, reducing significantly the number of collisions thanks to\nthe rule-based engine. For the second scenario, it has been possible to reduce\n20% of the time required to locate all the targets using the reinforcement\nlearning model. Conclusions: Reinforcement learning is a very good strategy to\nlearn policies for drone navigation, but in critical situations, it is\nnecessary to complement it with a rule-based module to increase task success\nrate.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u76ee\u6a19\uff1a\u672c\u6587\u8aaa\u660e\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u5c0e\u822a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c0e\u822a\u6a21\u7d44\u7d50\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u8207\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u4ee3\u7406\u72c0\u614b\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u4f7f\u7528\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\u4f7f\u7528\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u5c0e\u822a\u6a21\u7d44\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u7a2e\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u64da\u5176\u89c0\u5bdf\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c07\u4eba\u985e\u6c7a\u7b56\u7d0d\u5165\u5c0e\u822a\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a5f\u5236\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u65bc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u591a\u7a2e\u5834\u666f\u4e26\u6839\u64da\u9069\u61c9\u6bcf\u500b\u5834\u666f\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5c0e\u822a\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5834\u666f\uff08\u5230\u9054\u5df2\u77e5\u76ee\u6a19\uff09\uff0c\u5df2\u80fd\u5920\u7372\u5f97 90% \u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u6b21\u6578\u5927\u5e45\u6e1b\u5c11\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u7b2c\u4e8c\u500b\u5834\u666f\uff0c\u5df2\u80fd\u5920\u6e1b\u5c11 20% \u7684\u6642\u9593\u4f86\u4f7f\u7528\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u627e\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u7d50\u8ad6\uff1a\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u5c0e\u822a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u88dc\u5145\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u6a21\u7d44\u4f86\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52d9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "author": "Rub\u00e9n San-Segundo et.al.", "authors": "Rub\u00e9n San-Segundo, Luc\u00eda Angulo, Manuel Gil-Mart\u00edn, David Carrami\u00f1ana, Ana M.

However, current models are sensitive to the settings\nused and automatic optimization methods often require human involvement. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce ComfyGI, a novel approach to automatically\nimprove workflows for image generation without the need for human intervention\ndriven by techniques from genetic improvement. This enables image generation\nwith significantly higher quality in terms of the alignment with the given\ndescription and the perceived aesthetics. On the performance side, we find that\noverall, the images generated with an optimized workflow are about 50% better\ncompared to the initial workflow in terms of the median ImageReward score.\nThese already good results are even surpassed in our human evaluation, as the\nparticipants preferred the images improved by ComfyGI in around 90% of the\ncases.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u52d5\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u518d\u50c5\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u7684\u9818\u57df\uff0c\n\u5be6\u52d9\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4e5f\u958b\u59cb\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5f88\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u52d5\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u4ecb\u5165\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5f4c\u88dc\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 ComfyGI\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u52d5\u6539\u5584\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7121\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u4ecb\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u7531\u907a\u50b3\u6539\u826f\u6280\u8853\u9a45\u52d5\u3002\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u8207\u7d66\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7f8e\u5b78\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u986f\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u3002\u5728\u6548\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u6574\u9ad4\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5728 ImageReward \u4e2d\u4f4d\u6578\u8a55\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u521d\u59cb\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9ad8\u51fa\u7d04 50%\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u5df2\u7d93\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u751a\u81f3\u88ab\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u5728\u7d04 90% \u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u66f4\u559c\u6b61 ComfyGI \u6539\u9032\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u3002", "author": "Dominik Sobania et.al.", "authors": "Dominik Sobania, Martin Briesch, Franz Rothlauf", "id": "2411.14193v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14193v1", "repo": "null"}}

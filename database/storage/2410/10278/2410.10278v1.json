Wu Chinese is mutually unintelligible with other Sinitic languages\nsuch as Mandarin and Yue (Cantonese), but uses a set of Hanzi (Chinese\ncharacters) that profoundly overlaps with others. The population of Wu speakers\nis the second largest among languages in China, but the language has been\nsuffering from significant drop in usage especially among the younger\ngenerations. We identify Wu Chinese as a textually low-resource language and\naddress challenges for its machine translation models. Our contributions\ninclude: (1) an open-source, manually translated dataset, (2) full\ndocumentations on the process of dataset creation and validation experiments,\n(3) preliminary tools for Wu Chinese normalization and segmentation, and (4)\nbenefits and limitations of our dataset, as well as implications to other\nlow-resource languages.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165 FLORES+ \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4f5c\u70ba\u73fe\u4ee3\u5433\u8a9e\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u5433\u8a9e\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u5433\u8a9e\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u6f22\u8a9e\u65cf\u8a9e\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u666e\u901a\u8a71\u548c\u7cb5\u8a9e\uff09\u4e92\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u5957\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u8a9e\u8a00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u758a\u7684\u6f22\u5b57\uff08\u4e2d\u6587\u6f22\u5b57\uff09\u3002\u5433\u8a9e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4eba\u53e3\u6578\u91cf\u5728\u4e2d\u570b\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4f46\u8a72\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u5e74\u8f15\u4e00\u4ee3\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5433\u8a9e\u8a8d\u5b9a\u70ba\u6587\u5b57\u8cc7\u6e90\u5331\u4e4f\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u4e26\u89e3\u6c7a\u5176\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u4e00\u500b\u958b\u6e90\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8b6f\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c(2) \u95dc\u65bc\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u9a57\u8b49\u5be6\u9a57\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c(3) \u5433\u8a9e\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u548c\u5206\u8a5e\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca (4) \u6211\u5011\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u5176\u4ed6\u8cc7\u6e90\u5331\u4e4f\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Hongjian Yu et.al.", "authors": "Hongjian Yu, Yiming Shi, Zherui Zhou, Christopher Haberland", "id": "2410.10278v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10278v1", "repo": "null"}}

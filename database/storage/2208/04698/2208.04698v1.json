Accordingly, prominent health\nstakeholders have recognized the importance of development of such services to\nmake patients life easier. Such support requires the collection of huge amount\nof patients complex data like clinical, environmental, nutritional, daily\nactivities, variety of data from smart wearable devices, data from clothing\nequipped with sensors etc. Holistic patients data must be properly aggregated,\nprocessed, analyzed, and presented to the doctors and caregivers to recommend\nadequate treatment and actions to improve patients health related parameters\nand general wellbeing. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques offer the\nopportunity to analyze such big data, consume them, and derive new knowledge to\nsupport personalized medical decisions. New approaches like those based on\nadvanced machine learning, federated learning, transfer learning, explainable\nartificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of health and\nmedical data in future. In this paper, we will present some crucial aspects and\ncharacteristic examples in the area of application of a range of artificial\nintelligence approaches in personalized medical decisions.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Mirjana Ivanovic et.al.", "authors": "Mirjana Ivanovic,Serge Autexier,Miltiadis Kokkonidis", "id": "2208.04698v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04698v1", "repo": "null"}}

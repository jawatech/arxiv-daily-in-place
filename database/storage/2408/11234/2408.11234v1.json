We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor,\nmulti-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based\nmodel which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD),\ncanopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for\nall three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled\nGEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying\nit over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to\n2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD\n(CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6\nMg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a\nsignificant improvement over previously published results. We also report the\nmodel performance against independently collected ground measurements published\nin the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying\nconditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless\ntransferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5b9a\u671f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5168\u7403\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u78b3\u5132\u91cf\u5c0d\u65bc\u570b\u5bb6\u548c\u570b\u969b\u6c23\u5019\u8a08\u756b\u4e0b\u7684\u78b3\u8a08\u91cf\u548c\u5831\u544a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u9762\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6642\u9593\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u5230\u5f88\u5927\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5df2\u63a1\u53d6\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u591a\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u6574\u5408\u9059\u6e2c\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u70ba 10 \u516c\u5c3a\u7684\u591a\u611f\u6e2c\u5668\u3001\u591a\u5149\u8b5c\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u500b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u7d71\u4e00\u4e86\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6 (AGBD)\u3001\u6a39\u51a0\u9ad8\u5ea6 (CH)\u3001\u6a39\u51a0\u8986\u84cb (CC) \u7684\u9810\u6e2c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u7a2e\u6578\u91cf\u7684\u8aa4\u5dee\u4f30\u8a08\u3002\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6578\u767e\u842c\u500b\u5168\u7403\u53d6\u6a23\u7684 GEDI-L2/L4 \u6e2c\u91cf\u503c\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5728 2023 \u5e74\u4ee5\u53ca 2016 \u5e74\u81f3 2023 \u5e74\u9593\u6bcf\u5e74\u5728\u9078\u5b9a\u5340\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d AGBD (CH\u3001CC) \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7d55\u5c0d\u8aa4\u5dee\u70ba 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m\uff0c9.9%)\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8aa4\u5dee\u70ba 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m\uff0c15.8%) \u5728\u5168\u7403\u53d6\u6a23\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u767c\u5e03\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u6709\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6539\u9032\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u6839\u64da\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u767c\u5e03\u7684\u7368\u7acb\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5730\u9762\u6e2c\u91cf\u503c\u5831\u544a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6e2c\u91cf\u503c\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u95dc\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u7684\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u982d\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5b83\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86\u5411\u5176\u4ed6 GEDI \u8b8a\u6578\u7684\u7121\u7e2b\u9077\u79fb\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Manuel Weber et.al.", "authors": "Manuel Weber, Carly Beneke, Clyde Wheeler", "id": "2408.11234v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11234v1", "repo": "null"}}

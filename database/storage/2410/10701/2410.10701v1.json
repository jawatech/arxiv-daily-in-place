This study\nexplores the application of image processing and deep learning techniques for\ndetecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a severe form of blood cancer\nresponsible for numerous annual fatalities. As artificial intelligence\ntechnologies advance, the research investigates the reliability of these\nmethods in real-world scenarios. The study focuses on recent developments in\nALL detection, particularly using the latest YOLO series models, to distinguish\nbetween malignant and benign white blood cells and to identify different stages\nof ALL, including early stages. Additionally, the models are capable of\ndetecting hematogones, which are often misclassified as ALL. By utilizing\nadvanced deep learning models like YOLOv8 and YOLOv11, the study achieves high\naccuracy rates reaching 98.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these\nalgorithms across multiple datasets and various real-world situations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6bcf\u5e74\u6709\u6578\u5343\u4eba\u50c5\u56e0\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u800c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u5f71\u50cf\u8655\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u5728\u5075\u6e2c\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u6027\u767d\u8840\u75c5 (ALL) \u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0cALL \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u56b4\u91cd\u7684\u8840\u764c\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u9020\u6210\u8a31\u591a\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6280\u8853\u7684\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc ALL \u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684 YOLO \u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5340\u5206\u60e1\u6027\u548c\u826f\u6027\u767d\u8840\u7403\uff0c\u4e26\u8b58\u5225 ALL \u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u9084\u80fd\u5075\u6e2c\u5e38\u88ab\u8aa4\u5206\u985e\u70ba ALL \u7684\u9020\u8840\u6bcd\u7d30\u80de\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528 YOLOv8 \u548c YOLOv11 \u7b49\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9054\u6210\u9ad8\u9054 98.8% \u7684\u9ad8\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u9019\u4e9b\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u5404\u7a2e\u5be6\u969b\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e2d\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002", "author": "Alaa Awad et.al.", "authors": "Alaa Awad, Mohamed Hegazy, Salah A.

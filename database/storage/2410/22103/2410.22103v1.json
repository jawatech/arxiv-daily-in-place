Automatic extraction of\ncompetences from CVs and Jobs can greatly promote recruiters' productivity in\nlocating relevant candidates for job vacancies. This work presents the first\nmodel that jointly extracts and classifies competence from Danish job postings.\nDifferent from existing works on skill extraction and skill classification, our\nmodel is trained on a large volume of annotated Danish corpora and is capable\nof extracting a wide range of Danish competences, including skills, occupations\nand knowledges of different categories. More importantly, as a single BERT-like\narchitecture for joint extraction and classification, our model is lightweight\nand efficient at inference. On a real-scenario job matching dataset, our model\nbeats the state-of-the-art models in the overall performance of Danish\ncompetence extraction and classification, and saves over 50% time at inference.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u8077\u696d\u6216\u77e5\u8b58\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5339\u914d\u662f\u6c42\u8077\u8005\u9069\u4efb\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u8981\u7d20\u3002\u5f9e\u5c65\u6b77\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u81ea\u52d5\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u62db\u52df\u4eba\u54e1\u5728\u5c0b\u627e\u8077\u7f3a\u76f8\u95dc\u6c42\u8077\u8005\u6642\u7684\u751f\u7522\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u6642\u5f9e\u4e39\u9ea5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8077\u7f3a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u985e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u985e\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u4e39\u9ea5\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u6a19\u8a3b\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4e26\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u53d6\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u4e39\u9ea5\u8a9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u5225\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u8077\u696d\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u7528\u65bc\u806f\u5408\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u985e\u7684\u55ae\u4e00 BERT \u985e\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f15\u91cf\u4e14\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6642\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u5834\u666f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5339\u914d\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e39\u9ea5\u8a9e\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u985e\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u8868\u73fe\u4e0a\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6642\u7bc0\u7701\u8d85\u904e 50% \u7684\u6642\u9593\u3002", "author": "Qiuchi Li et.al.", "authors": "Qiuchi Li, Christina Lioma", "id": "2410.22103v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22103v1", "repo": "null"}}

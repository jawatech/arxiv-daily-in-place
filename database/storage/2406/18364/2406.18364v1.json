At the same\ntime, there are many challenges in creating Chinese news summaries. First of\nall, the semantics of Chinese news is complex, and the amount of information is\nenormous. Extracting critical information from Chinese news presents a\nsignificant challenge. Second, the news summary should be concise and clear,\nfocusing on the main content and avoiding redundancy. In addition, the\nparticularity of the Chinese language, such as polysemy, word segmentation,\netc., makes it challenging to generate Chinese news summaries. Based on the\nabove, this paper studies the information extraction method of the LCSTS\ndataset based on an improved BERTSum-LSTM model. We improve the BERTSum-LSTM\nmodel to make it perform better in generating Chinese news summaries. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method has a good effect on\ncreating news summaries, which is of great importance to the construction of\nnews summaries.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u6301\u7e8c\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u6280\u8853\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e5f\u9762\u81e8\u8457\u8af8\u591a\u6311\u6230\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u65b0\u805e\u8a9e\u7fa9\u8907\u96dc\uff0c\u8cc7\u8a0a\u91cf\u9f90\u5927\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e2d\u6587\u65b0\u805e\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u95dc\u9375\u8cc7\u8a0a\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u8271\u9245\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u61c9\u7c21\u6f54\u660e\u77ad\uff0c\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u4e3b\u8981\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5197\u9918\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u591a\u7fa9\u6027\u3001\u8a5e\u8a9e\u5207\u5206\u7b49\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u4e2d\u6587\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5e36\u4f86\u6311\u6230\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u6539\u9032\u7684 BERTSum-LSTM \u6a21\u578b\u7684 LCSTS \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6539\u9032\u4e86 BERTSum-LSTM \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6587\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c0d\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c0d\u65b0\u805e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u69cb\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u3002", "author": "Yiming Chen et.al.", "authors": "Yiming Chen, Haobin Chen, Simin Liu, Yunyun Liu, Fanhao Zhou, Bing Wei", "id": "2406.18364v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18364v1", "repo": "null"}}

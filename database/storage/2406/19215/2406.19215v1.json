{"2406.19215": {"publish_time": "2024-06-27", "title": "SeaKR: Self-aware Knowledge Retrieval for Adaptive Retrieval Augmented Generation", "paper_summary": "This paper introduces Self-aware Knowledge Retrieval (SeaKR), a novel\nadaptive RAG model that extracts self-aware uncertainty of LLMs from their\ninternal states. SeaKR activates retrieval when the LLMs present high\nself-aware uncertainty for generation. To effectively integrate retrieved\nknowledge snippets, SeaKR re-ranks them based on LLM's self-aware uncertainty\nto preserve the snippet that reduces their uncertainty to the utmost. To\nfacilitate solving complex tasks that require multiple retrievals, SeaKR\nutilizes their self-aware uncertainty to choose among different reasoning\nstrategies. Our experiments on both complex and simple Question Answering\ndatasets show that SeaKR outperforms existing adaptive RAG methods.

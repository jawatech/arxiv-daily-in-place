Robotic laparoscopic surgery presents two main\nchallenges: (1) the need to manipulate forceps using ports established on the\nbody surface as fulcrums, and (2) difficulty in perceiving depth information\nwhen working with a monocular camera that displays its images on a monitor.\nEspecially, regarding issue (2), most prior research has assumed the\navailability of depth images or models of a target to be operated on.\nTherefore, in this study, we achieve more accurate imitation learning with only\nmonocular images by extracting motion constraints from one exemplary motion of\nskilled operators, collecting data based on these constraints, and conducting\nimitation learning based on the collected data. We implemented an overall\nsystem using two Franka Emika Panda Robot Arms and validated its effectiveness.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Kento Kawaharazuka et.al.", "authors": "Kento Kawaharazuka,Kei Okada,Masayuki Inaba", "id": "2405.03440v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03440v1", "repo": "null"}}

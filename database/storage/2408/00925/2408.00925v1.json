{"2408.00925": {"publish_time": "2024-08-01", "title": "WHITE PAPER: A Brief Exploration of Data Exfiltration using GCG Suffixes", "paper_summary": "The cross-prompt injection attack (XPIA) is an effective technique that can\nbe used for data exfiltration, and that has seen increasing use. In this\nattack, the attacker injects a malicious instruction into third party data\nwhich an LLM is likely to consume when assisting a user, who is the victim.\nXPIA is often used as a means for data exfiltration, and the estimated cost of\nthe average data breach for a business is nearly $4.5 million, which includes\nbreaches such as compromised enterprise credentials. With the rise of\ngradient-based attacks such as the GCG suffix attack, the odds of an XPIA\noccurring which uses a GCG suffix are worryingly high. As part of my work in\nMicrosoft's AI Red Team, I demonstrated a viable attack model using a GCG\nsuffix paired with an injection in a simulated XPIA scenario. The results\nindicate that the presence of a GCG suffix can increase the odds of successful\ndata exfiltration by nearly 20%, with some caveats.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb (XPIA) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u6b21\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5411\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u800c LLM \u5728\u534f\u52a9\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6307\u4ee4\u3002XPIA \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a5\u8fd1 450 \u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u51ed\u8bc1\u3002\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982 GCG \u540e\u7f00\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u53d1\u751f\u4f7f\u7528 GCG \u540e\u7f00\u7684 XPIA \u7684\u51e0\u7387\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u5730\u9ad8\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6211\u5728 Microsoft AI \u7ea2\u961f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528 GCG \u540e\u7f00\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df XPIA \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCG \u540e\u7f00\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u51e0\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1 20%\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8b66\u544a\u3002", "author": "Victor Valbuena et.al.", "authors": "Victor Valbuena", "id": "2408.00925v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00925v1", "repo": "null"}}

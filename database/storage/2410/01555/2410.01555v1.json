These systems are crucial in providing underrepresented\npopulations with improved access to valuable education. One important area of\neducation that is unavailable to many learners is strategic bargaining related\nto negotiation. To address this, we develop a LLM-based Assistant for Coaching\nnEgotiation (ACE). ACE not only serves as a negotiation partner for users but\nalso provides them with targeted feedback for improvement. To build our system,\nwe collect a dataset of negotiation transcripts between MBA students. These\ntranscripts come from trained negotiators and emulate realistic bargaining\nscenarios. We use the dataset, along with expert consultations, to design an\nannotation scheme for detecting negotiation mistakes. ACE employs this scheme\nto identify mistakes and provide targeted feedback to users. To test the\neffectiveness of ACE-generated feedback, we conducted a user experiment with\ntwo consecutive trials of negotiation and found that it improves negotiation\nperformances significantly compared to a system that doesn't provide feedback\nand one which uses an alternative method of providing feedback.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7531\u65bc LLM \u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f AI \u8f14\u5c0e\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u958b\u767c\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u65bc\u63d0\u4f9b\u6559\u80b2\u6a5f\u6703\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u53d6\u5f97\u5bf6\u8cb4\u6559\u80b2\u8cc7\u6e90\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7121\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u8981\u6559\u80b2\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u662f\u8207\u5354\u5546\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8b70\u50f9\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u7684\u5354\u5546\u8f14\u5c0e\u52a9\u7406 (ACE)\u3002ACE \u4e0d\u50c5\u4f5c\u70ba\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u5354\u5546\u5925\u4f34\uff0c\u9084\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u56de\u994b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f9b\u6539\u9032\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5efa\u7f6e\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44 MBA \u5b78\u751f\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5354\u5546\u8a18\u9304\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u8a18\u9304\u4f86\u81ea\u53d7\u904e\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5354\u5546\u8005\uff0c\u4e26\u6a21\u64ec\u5be6\u969b\u7684\u8b70\u50f9\u60c5\u5883\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c08\u5bb6\u8aee\u8a62\uff0c\u4f86\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e00\u500b\u8a3b\u89e3\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5075\u6e2c\u5354\u5546\u932f\u8aa4\u3002ACE \u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u8b58\u5225\u932f\u8aa4\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u56de\u994b\u7d66\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6e2c\u8a66 ACE \u6240\u7522\u751f\u56de\u994b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5169\u6b21\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u5354\u5546\u8a66\u9a57\uff0c\u4e26\u767c\u73fe\u8207\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u56de\u994b\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u7a2e\u63d0\u4f9b\u56de\u994b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u986f\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5354\u5546\u8868\u73fe\u3002", "author": "Ryan Shea et.al.", "authors": "Ryan Shea, Aymen Kallala, Xin Lucy Liu, Michael W.

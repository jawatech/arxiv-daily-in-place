To evaluate human behavior, the American legal\nsystem often uses the \"Reasonable Person Standard.\" The idea of \"reasonable\"\nbehavior comes up in nearly every area of law. The legal system often judges\nthe actions of parties with respect to what a reasonable person would have done\nunder similar circumstances. This paper argues that the reasonable person\nstandard provides useful guidelines for the type of behavior we should develop,\nprobe, and stress-test in models. It explains how reasonableness is defined and\nused in key areas of the law using illustrative cases, how the reasonable\nperson standard could apply to AI behavior in each of these areas and contexts,\nand how our societal understanding of \"reasonable\" behavior provides useful\ntechnical goals for AI researchers.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u65e5\u76ca\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\u5df2\u8a2d\u4e0b\u898f\u7bc4\u7684\u9818\u57df\uff0cAI \u6cbb\u7406\u548c AI \u5c0d\u9f4a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u6311\u6230\u662f\u8981\u4ee5\u5c0d\u793e\u6703\u6709\u76ca\u4e14\u5177\u5efa\u8a2d\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u898f\u7bc4\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u56de\u7b54\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u8a62\u554f\uff1a\u6211\u5011\u8981\u5982\u4f55\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6a21\u64ec\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\uff1f\u70ba\u4e86\u8a55\u4f30\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9ad4\u7cfb\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u300c\u5408\u7406\u4eba\u6a19\u6e96\u300d\u3002\u300c\u5408\u7406\u300d\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u51fa\u73fe\u5728\u5e7e\u4e4e\u6bcf\u500b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9818\u57df\u3002\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9ad4\u7cfb\u901a\u5e38\u6839\u64da\u5408\u7406\u4eba\u5728\u985e\u4f3c\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u6703\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u884c\u52d5\u4f86\u5224\u65b7\u7576\u4e8b\u4eba\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u4eba\u6a19\u6e96\u70ba\u6211\u5011\u61c9\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u958b\u767c\u3001\u63a2\u8a0e\u548c\u9032\u884c\u58d3\u529b\u6e2c\u8a66\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u985e\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6e96\u5247\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95dc\u9375\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5b9a\u7fa9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u8aaa\u660e\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u4eba\u6a19\u6e96\u5982\u4f55\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u9019\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684 AI \u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u300c\u5408\u7406\u300d\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u793e\u6703\u7406\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u70ba AI \u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6280\u8853\u76ee\u6a19\u3002", "author": "Sunayana Rane et.al.", "authors": "Sunayana Rane", "id": "2406.04671v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04671v1", "repo": "null"}}

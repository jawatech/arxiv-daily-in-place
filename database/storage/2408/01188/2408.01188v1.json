{"2408.01188": {"publish_time": "2024-08-02", "title": "Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimisation in Autonomous Systems", "paper_summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used extensively in Autonomous Systems (AS) as\nit enables learning at runtime without the need for a model of the environment\nor predefined actions. However, most applications of RL in AS, such as those\nbased on Q-learning, can only optimize one objective, making it necessary in\nmulti-objective systems to combine multiple objectives in a single objective\nfunction with predefined weights. A number of Multi-Objective Reinforcement\nLearning (MORL) techniques exist but they have mostly been applied in RL\nbenchmarks rather than real-world AS systems. In this work, we use a MORL\ntechnique called Deep W-Learning (DWN) and apply it to the Emergent Web Servers\nexemplar, a self-adaptive server, to find the optimal configuration for runtime\nperformance optimization. We compare DWN to two single-objective optimization\nimplementations: {\\epsilon}-greedy algorithm and Deep Q-Networks. Our initial\nevaluation shows that DWN optimizes multiple objectives simultaneously with\nsimilar results than DQN and {\\epsilon}-greedy approaches, having a better\nperformance for some metrics, and avoids issues associated with combining\nmultiple objectives into a single utility function.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08RL\uff09\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08AS\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u57f7\u884c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u74b0\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cRL \u5728 AS \u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6578\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57fa\u65bc Q \u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u4e00\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u5fc5\u9808\u5c07\u591a\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\u7d44\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u500b\u5177\u6709\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9\u6b0a\u91cd\u7684\u55ae\u4e00\u76ee\u6a19\u51fd\u6578\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08MORL\uff09\u6280\u8853\u5df2\u7d93\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5927\u591a\u61c9\u7528\u65bc RL \u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u7684 AS \u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u6df1\u5ea6 W \u5b78\u7fd2\uff08DWN\uff09\u7684 MORL \u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u65b0\u8208 Web \u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff08\u4e00\u7a2e\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u4f3a\u670d\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u57f7\u884c\u6642\u6548\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07 DWN \u8207\u5169\u500b\u55ae\u76ee\u6a19\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u5be6\u4f5c\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a{\\epsilon}-greedy \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6 Q \u7db2\u8def\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0cDWN \u540c\u6642\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u591a\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u5176\u7d50\u679c\u8207 DQN \u548c {\\epsilon}-greedy \u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6a19\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e26\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5c07\u591a\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\u7d44\u5408\u6210\u55ae\u4e00\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6578\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Juan C.

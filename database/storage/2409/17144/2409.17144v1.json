The models, however, should\nnot expose private information from these datasets. Differentially private SGD\n[DP-SGD] requires the modification of the standard stochastic gradient descent\n[SGD] algorithm for training new models. In this short paper, a novel\nregularization strategy is proposed to achieve the same goal in a more\nefficient manner.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u57fa\u65bc\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u8a13\u7df4\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u61c9\u516c\u958b\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u96b1\u79c1 SGD [DP-SGD] \u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u6a19\u6e96\u96a8\u6a5f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d [SGD] \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u624d\u80fd\u8a13\u7df4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u9019\u7bc7\u77ed\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u6b63\u898f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9054\u6210\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u3002", "author": "Francisco Aguilera-Mart\u00ednez et.al.", "authors": "Francisco Aguilera-Mart\u00ednez, Fernando Berzal", "id": "2409.17144v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17144v1", "repo": "null"}}

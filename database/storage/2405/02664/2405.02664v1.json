Extracting relevant medical\ninformation required for further treatment planning or even research is a time\nconsuming labour intensive task involving the much valuable time of doctors. In\nthis demo paper we present, MedPromptExtract an automated tool using a\ncombination of semi supervised learning, large language models, natural\nlanuguage processing and prompt engineering to convert unstructured medical\nrecords to structured data which is amenable to further analysis.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Roomani Srivastava et.al.", "authors": "Roomani Srivastava,Suraj Prasad,Lipika Bhat,Sarvesh Deshpande,Barnali Das,Kshitij Jadhav", "id": "2405.02664v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02664v1", "repo": "null"}}

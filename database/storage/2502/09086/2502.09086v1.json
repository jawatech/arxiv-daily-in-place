However, obtaining labeled data is often expensive and\ndifficult, especially in few-shot learning scenarios. To solve this problem,\nthis paper proposes a few-shot text classification model based on transfer\nlearning and meta-learning. The model uses the knowledge of the pre-trained\nmodel for transfer and optimizes the model's rapid adaptability in few-sample\ntasks through a meta-learning mechanism. Through a series of comparative\nexperiments and ablation experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. The experimental results show that under the conditions of few\nsamples and medium samples, the model based on transfer learning and\nmeta-learning significantly outperforms traditional machine learning and deep\nlearning methods. In addition, ablation experiments further analyzed the\ncontribution of each component to the model performance and confirmed the key\nrole of transfer learning and meta-learning in improving model accuracy.\nFinally, this paper discusses future research directions and looks forward to\nthe potential of this method in practical applications.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u6280\u8853\u7684\u6301\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u500b\u61c9\u7528\u9818\u57df\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7372\u53d6\u6a19\u8a18\u8cc7\u6599\u901a\u5e38\u65e2\u6602\u8cb4\u53c8\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u6a23\u672c\u5b78\u7fd2\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5143\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u5c11\u6a23\u672c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u9032\u884c\u9077\u79fb\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u5143\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a5f\u5236\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6a23\u672c\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u3002\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u5be6\u9a57\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6a23\u672c\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5143\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5be6\u9a57\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u500b\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u4e26\u78ba\u8a8d\u4e86\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5143\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e26\u671f\u5f85\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002", "author": "Jia Gao et.al.", "authors": "Jia Gao, Shuangquan Lyu, Guiran Liu, Binrong Zhu, Hongye Zheng, Xiaoxuan Liao", "id": "2502.09086v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09086v1", "repo": "null"}}

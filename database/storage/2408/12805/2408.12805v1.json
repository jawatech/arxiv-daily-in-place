However, as a result of the safety-performance\ntrade-off mechanism of evolutionary algorithms, it is difficult to ensure safe\nexploration without sacrificing the improvement ability. This problem is\nespecially prominent in dynamic traffic scenarios. Therefore, this paper\nproposes a safe self-evolution algorithm for autonomous driving based on\ndata-driven risk quantification model. Specifically, a risk quantification\nmodel based on the attention mechanism is proposed by modeling the way humans\nperceive risks during driving, with the idea of achieving safety situation\nestimation of the surrounding environment through a data-driven approach. To\nprevent the impact of over-conservative safety guarding policies on the\nself-evolution capability of the algorithm, a safety-evolutionary\ndecision-control integration algorithm with adjustable safety limits is\nproposed, and the proposed risk quantization model is integrated into it.\nSimulation and real-vehicle experiments results illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method. The results show that the proposed algorithm can generate\nsafe and reasonable actions in a variety of complex scenarios and guarantee\nsafety without losing the evolutionary potential of learning-based autonomous\ndriving systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u9032\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7cfb\u7d71\u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u5728\u8907\u96dc\u4e14\u958b\u653e\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7368\u7acb\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u80fd\u5920\u8655\u7406\u66f4\u591a\u672a\u77e5\u5834\u666f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f14\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6548\u80fd\u6b0a\u8861\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u96e3\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u72a7\u7272\u6539\u9032\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u5728\u52d5\u614b\u4ea4\u901a\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u5c24\u70ba\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u65bc\u6578\u64da\u9a45\u52d5\u98a8\u96aa\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u65bc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u64ec\u4eba\u985e\u99d5\u99db\u6642\u611f\u77e5\u98a8\u96aa\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u901a\u904e\u6578\u64da\u9a45\u52d5\u65b9\u5f0f\u5be6\u73fe\u5c0d\u5468\u570d\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u614b\u52e2\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u70ba\u907f\u514d\u904e\u65bc\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u8b77\u7b56\u7565\u5c0d\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8abf\u5b89\u5168\u908a\u754c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f14\u5316\u6c7a\u7b56\u63a7\u5236\u6574\u5408\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5176\u4e2d\u3002\u6a21\u64ec\u8207\u5be6\u8eca\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u7a2e\u8907\u96dc\u5834\u666f\u4e0b\u7522\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u7406\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u55aa\u5931\u5b78\u7fd2\u578b\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7cfb\u7d71\u6f14\u5316\u6f5b\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8b49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "author": "Shuo Yang et.al.", "authors": "Shuo Yang, Shizhen Li, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen", "id": "2408.12805v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12805v1", "repo": "null"}}

AI, on the\nother hand, can be leveraged to innovate and streamline semiconductor\ntechnology from planning and implementation to manufacturing. In this paper, we\npresent \\textit{Intelligent OPC Engineer Assistant}, an AI/LLM-powered\nmethodology designed to solve the core manufacturing-aware optimization problem\nknown as optical proximity correction (OPC). The methodology involves a\nreinforcement learning-based OPC recipe search and a customized multi-modal\nagent system for recipe summarization. Experiments demonstrate that our\nmethodology can efficiently build OPC recipes on various chip designs with\nspecially handled design topologies, a task that typically requires the\nfull-time effort of OPC engineers with years of experience.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6676\u7247\u8a2d\u8a08\u8207\u88fd\u9020\u7684\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u8207\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7b49\u8907\u96dc\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u8655\u7406\u6210\u70ba\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u70ba\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u6167 (AGI) \u7684\u767c\u5c55\u92ea\u8def\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u5275\u65b0\u548c\u7c21\u5316\u534a\u5c0e\u9ad4\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5f9e\u898f\u5283\u548c\u5be6\u65bd\u5230\u88fd\u9020\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u300cIntelligent OPC \u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\u52a9\u7406\u300d\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u7531 AI/LLM \u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u7a31\u70ba\u5149\u5b78\u9130\u8fd1\u4fee\u6b63 (OPC) \u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u88fd\u9020\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u554f\u984c\u3002\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\u6d89\u53ca\u57fa\u65bc\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684 OPC \u914d\u65b9\u641c\u5c0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u65bc\u914d\u65b9\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5ba2\u88fd\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u6676\u7247\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u7acb OPC \u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u8655\u7406\u8a2d\u8a08\u62d3\u64b2\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5177\u6709\u591a\u5e74\u7d93\u9a57\u7684 OPC \u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\u5168\u8077\u6295\u5165\u3002", "author": "Guojin Chen et.al.", "authors": "Guojin Chen, Haoyu Yang, Haoxing Ren, Bei Yu", "id": "2408.12775v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12775v1", "repo": "null"}}

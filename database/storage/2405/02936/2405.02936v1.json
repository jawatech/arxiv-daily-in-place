Recent works have unveiled\npositive complexity results regarding the computation of the SHAP score for\nspecific model families, encompassing decision trees, random forests, and some\nclasses of boolean circuits. Yet, all these positive results hinge on the\nassumption of feature independence, often simplistic in real-world scenarios.\nIn this article, we investigate the computational complexity of the SHAP score\nby relaxing this assumption and introducing a Markovian perspective. We show\nthat, under the Markovian assumption, computing the SHAP score for the class of\nWeighted automata, Disjoint DNFs and Decision Trees can be performed in\npolynomial time, offering a first positive complexity result for the problem of\nSHAP score computation that transcends the limitations of the feature\nindependence assumption.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Reda Marzouk et.al.", "authors": "Reda Marzouk,Colin de La Higuera", "id": "2405.02936v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02936v1", "repo": "null"}}

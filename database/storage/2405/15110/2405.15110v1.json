We show that a\nsignificant portion of the FaithDial data contains annotation artifacts, which\nmay bias models towards completely ignoring the conversation history. We\ntherefore introduce CHARP, a diagnostic test set, designed for an improved\nevaluation of hallucinations in conversational model. CHARP not only measures\nhallucination but also the compliance of the models to the conversation task.\nOur extensive analysis reveals that models primarily exhibit poor performance\non CHARP due to their inability to effectively attend to and reason over the\nconversation history. Furthermore, the evaluation methods of FaithDial fail to\ncapture these shortcomings, neglecting the conversational history. Our findings\nindicate that there is substantial room for contribution in both dataset\ncreation and hallucination evaluation for knowledge-grounded dialogue, and that\nCHARP can serve as a tool for monitoring the progress in this particular\nresearch area.

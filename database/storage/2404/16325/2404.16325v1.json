Further, the significant domain\ngap between natural and medical images in general and ultrasound images in\nparticular hinders fine-tuning models trained on natural images to the task at\nhand. In this work, we address the performance degradation of segmentation\nmodels in low-data regimes and propose a prompt-less segmentation method\nharnessing the ability of segmentation foundation models to segment abstract\nshapes. We do that via our novel prompt point generation algorithm which uses\ncoarse semantic segmentation masks as input and a zero-shot prompt-able\nfoundation model as an optimization target. We demonstrate our method on a\nsegmentation findings task (pathologic anomalies) in ultrasound images. Our\nmethod's advantages are brought to light in varying degrees of low-data regime\nexperiments on a small-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound images dataset,\nyielding a larger performance gain as the training set size decreases.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Hedda Cohen Indelman et.al.", "authors": "Hedda Cohen Indelman,Elay Dahan,Angeles M.

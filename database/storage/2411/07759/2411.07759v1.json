This forms the state representation for the RL\nenvironment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables\nor a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high\ndimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC.\nHowever, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional\nstate representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with\nimprovements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional\nrepresentation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure\n(V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the\nlarge size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient\nmodels and explored model compression via pruning.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u57fa\u65bc\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u865f\u8a8c\u63a7\u5236 (TSC) \u4e2d\uff0c\n\u6709\u95dc\u865f\u8a8c\u6642\u5e8f\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u662f\u6839\u64da\u9053\u8def\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u8eca\u8f1b\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u8cc7\u8a0a\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u3002\u9019\u5f62\u6210\u4e86 RL \u74b0\u5883\u7684\u72c0\u614b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u5305\u542b\u591a\u500b\u8b8a\u6578\u7684\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4f4e\u7dad\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u72c0\u614b\u8868\u793a\u4e26\u4e0d\u6703\u63d0\u9ad8 TSC \u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8ad6\u8b49\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u72c0\u614b\u8868\u793a\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8 TSC \u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u6642\u9593\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u6539\u5584 17.9%\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u8eca\u5c0d\u57fa\u790e\u8a2d\u65bd (V2I) \u901a\u8a0a\u7372\u5f97\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u9f13\u52f5\u5176\u7528\u65bc TSC\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9451\u65bc\u72c0\u614b\u898f\u6a21\u9f90\u5927\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u64c1\u6709\u8a08\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u526a\u679d\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u58d3\u7e2e\u3002", "author": "Lawrence Francis et.al.", "authors": "Lawrence Francis, Blessed Guda, Ahmed Biyabani", "id": "2411.07759v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07759v1", "repo": "null"}}

This is achieved through a parallel attention\nmechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from\nconditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to\nsignificantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world\nscenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the\nresiduals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost\nstrategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing\nmodels. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on\nhigh-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in\nproducing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details.\nFurthermore, AnyFit's impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons\nin any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the\nfashion community.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u57fa\u65bc\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u865b\u64ec\u8a66\u7a7f\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u8208\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7121\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u7684\u5408\u8eab\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u670d\u88dd\u6b3e\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5408\u8eab\u548c\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u54c1\u8cea\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u66f4\u5225\u63d0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0d\u5404\u7a2e\u670d\u88dd\u7d44\u5408\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u8f15\u91cf\u7d1a\u3001\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u5143\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba Hydra Block\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u670d\u88dd\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u9019\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u4e26\u884c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u5be6\u73fe\uff0c\u8a72\u6a5f\u5236\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86\u5c07\u591a\u4ef6\u670d\u88dd\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u5f9e\u689d\u4ef6\u7de8\u78bc\u5206\u652f\u6ce8\u5165\u4e3b\u7db2\u8def\u4e2d\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u589e\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73fe\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5408\u6210\u591a\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b98\u5dee\uff0c\u4e26\u5be6\u4f5c\u906e\u7f69\u5340\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u514b\u670d\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5916\u6d29\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u6709\u4e86\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0cAnyFit \u5728\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u57fa\u6e96\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u90fd\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u64c5\u9577\u88fd\u4f5c\u5408\u8eab\u7684\u670d\u88dd\uff0c\u4e26\u5177\u6709\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u7d30\u7bc0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cAnyFit \u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u4efb\u4f55\u5834\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865b\u64ec\u8a66\u7a7f\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u70ba\u6642\u5c1a\u793e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u92ea\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u689d\u65b0\u8def\u3002", "author": "Yuhan Li et.al.", "authors": "Yuhan Li, Hao Zhou, Wenxiang Shang, Ran Lin, Xuanhong Chen, Bingbing Ni", "id": "2405.18172v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18172v1", "repo": "null"}}

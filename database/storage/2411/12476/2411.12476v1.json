{"2411.12476": {"publish_time": "2024-11-19", "title": "Comparing Prior and Learned Time Representations in Transformer Models of Timeseries", "paper_summary": "What sets timeseries analysis apart from other machine learning exercises is\nthat time representation becomes a primary aspect of the experiment setup, as\nit must adequately represent the temporal relations that are relevant for the\napplication at hand. In the work described here we study wo different\nvariations of the Transformer architecture: one where we use the fixed time\nrepresentation proposed in the literature and one where the time representation\nis learned from the data. Our experiments use data from predicting the energy\noutput of solar panels, a task that exhibits known periodicities (daily and\nseasonal) that is straight-forward to encode in the fixed time representation.\nOur results indicate that even in an experiment where the phenomenon is\nwell-understood, it is difficult to encode prior knowledge due to side-effects\nthat are difficult to mitigate. We conclude that research work is needed to\nwork the human into the learning loop in ways that improve the robustness and\ntrust-worthiness of the network.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6642\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7df4\u7fd2\u4e4b\u8655\u5728\u65bc\uff0c\u6642\u9593\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u6210\u70ba\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5fc5\u9808\u9069\u7576\u5730\u8868\u793a\u8207\u624b\u908a\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6642\u5e8f\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 Transformer \u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u5169\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8b8a\u7570\uff1a\u4e00\u7a2e\u662f\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6642\u9593\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7a2e\u5247\u662f\u5f9e\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u6642\u9593\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4f7f\u7528\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u96fb\u6c60\u677f\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f38\u51fa\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u9031\u671f\u6027\uff08\u6bcf\u65e5\u548c\u5b63\u7bc0\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u7de8\u78bc\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6642\u9593\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u73fe\u8c61\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u96e3\u4ee5\u6e1b\u8f15\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f88\u96e3\u7de8\u78bc\u5148\u9a57\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c07\u4eba\u985e\u7d0d\u5165\u5b78\u7fd2\u8ff4\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Natalia Koliou et.al.", "authors": "Natalia Koliou, Tatiana Boura, Stasinos Konstantopoulos, George Meramveliotakis, George Kosmadakis", "id": "2411.12476v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12476v1", "repo": "null"}}

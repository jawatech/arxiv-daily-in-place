The complexity of analyzing\ndiverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep\nlearning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their\n'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in\ncritical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a\ndeep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical\ntime steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability\nand supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism\ncould be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as\nN-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep\nlearning models while enhancing interpretability through\nattention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD\ndataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed\nits performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW)\nmetrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the\ndifferences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing\nvital sign forecasting.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yuwei Liu et.al.", "authors": "Yuwei Liu,Chen Dan,Anubhav Bhatti,Bingjie Shen,Divij Gupta,Suraj Parmar,San Lee", "id": "2405.01714v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01714v2", "repo": "null"}}

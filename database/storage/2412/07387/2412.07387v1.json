{"2412.07387": {"publish_time": "2024-12-10", "title": "Enhanced MRI Representation via Cross-series Masking", "paper_summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for diagnosing and planning\ntreatment in various medical conditions due to its ability to produce\nmulti-series images that reveal different tissue characteristics. However,\nintegrating these diverse series to form a coherent analysis presents\nsignificant challenges, such as differing spatial resolutions and contrast\npatterns meanwhile requiring extensive annotated data, which is scarce in\nclinical practice. Due to these issues, we introduce a novel Cross-Series\nMasking (CSM) Strategy for effectively learning MRI representation in a\nself-supervised manner. Specifically, CSM commences by randomly sampling a\nsubset of regions and series, which are then strategically masked. In the\ntraining process, the cross-series representation is learned by utilizing the\nunmasked data to reconstruct the masked portions. This process not only\nintegrates information across different series but also facilitates the ability\nto model both intra-series and inter-series correlations and complementarities.\nWith the learned representation, the downstream tasks like segmentation and\nclassification are also enhanced. Taking brain tissue segmentation, breast\ntumor benign/malignant classification, and prostate cancer diagnosis as\nexamples, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both public and\nin-house datasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u78c1\u632f\u9020\u5f71 (MRI) \u5c0d\u65bc\u8a3a\u65b7\u548c\u898f\u5283\u5404\u7a2e\u91ab\u7642\u72c0\u6cc1\u7684\u6cbb\u7642\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u80fd\u5920\u7522\u751f\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7d44\u7e54\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u591a\u7cfb\u5217\u5f71\u50cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9019\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u9023\u8cab\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0d\u6bd4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8a3b\u89e3\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\u537b\u5f88\u7a00\u5c11\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u906e\u7f69 (CSM) \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u76e3\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b78\u7fd2 MRI \u8868\u5fb5\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0cCSM \u5f9e\u96a8\u6a5f\u62bd\u6a23\u5340\u57df\u548c\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c0d\u5176\u9032\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u906e\u7f69\u3002\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u8868\u5fb5\u662f\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u672a\u906e\u7f69\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u91cd\u5efa\u906e\u7f69\u90e8\u5206\u800c\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u3002\u9019\u500b\u904e\u7a0b\u4e0d\u50c5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u9084\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86\u5c0d\u7cfb\u5217\u5167\u548c\u7cfb\u5217\u9593\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u548c\u4e92\u88dc\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5206\u985e\uff09\u4e5f\u6703\u5f97\u5230\u589e\u5f37\u3002\u4ee5\u8166\u7d44\u7e54\u5206\u5272\u3001\u4e73\u623f\u816b\u7624\u826f\u6027/\u60e1\u6027\u5206\u985e\u548c\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u8a3a\u65b7\u70ba\u4f8b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u5167\u90e8\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Churan Wang et.al.", "authors": "Churan Wang, Fei Gao, Lijun Yan, Siwen Wang, Yizhou Yu, Yizhou Wang", "id": "2412.07387v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07387v1", "repo": "null"}}

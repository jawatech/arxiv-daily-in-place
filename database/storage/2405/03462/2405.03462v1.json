Deep learning advancements led clinicians to increasingly use\nsophisticated models to make faster and more accurate decisions, sometimes\nreplacing human judgment. However, model development is costly and repetitive.\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) provides solutions by automating the design of\ndeep learning architectures. This paper presents ZO-DARTS+, a differentiable\nNAS algorithm that improves search efficiency through a novel method of\ngenerating sparse probabilities by bi-level optimization. Experiments on five\npublic medical datasets show that ZO-DARTS+ matches the accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art solutions while reducing search times by up to three times.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Lunchen Xie et.al.", "authors": "Lunchen Xie,Eugenio Lomurno,Matteo Gambella,Danilo Ardagna,Manuel Roveri,Matteo Matteucci,Qingjiang Shi", "id": "2405.03462v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03462v1", "repo": "null"}}

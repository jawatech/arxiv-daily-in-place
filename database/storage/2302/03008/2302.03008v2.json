Early diagnosis is critical for patients to benefit\nfrom potential intervention and treatment. The retina has been hypothesized as\na diagnostic site for AD detection owing to its anatomical connection with the\nbrain. Developed AI models for this purpose have yet to provide a rational\nexplanation about the decision and neither infer the stage of disease's\nprogression. Along this direction, we propose a novel model-agnostic\nexplainable-AI framework, called Granular Neuron-level Explainer (LAVA), an\ninterpretation prototype that probes into intermediate layers of the\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to assess the AD continuum directly\nfrom the retinal imaging without longitudinal or clinical evaluation. This\nmethod is applied to validate the retinal vasculature as a biomarker and\ndiagnostic modality for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) evaluation. UK Biobank\ncognitive tests and vascular morphological features suggest LAVA shows strong\npromise and effectiveness in identifying AD stages across the progression\ncontinuum.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Nooshin Yousefzadeh et.al.", "authors": "Nooshin Yousefzadeh,Charlie Tran,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Jinghua Chen,Ruogu Fang,My T.

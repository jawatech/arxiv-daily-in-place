Large Language\nModels (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard can be leveraged to automate boilerplate\ntasks, create content for personalised teaching, and handle repetitive tasks to\nallow more time for creative thinking. However, it is important to develop\nguidelines, policies, and assessment methods in the education sector to ensure\nthe responsible integration of these tools. In this article, thematic analysis\nhas been performed on seven essays obtained from professionals in the education\nsector to understand the advantages and pitfalls of using GenAI models such as\nChatGPT and Bard in education. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been\nperformed on the essays to extract further insights from the text. The study\nfound several themes which highlight benefits and drawbacks of GenAI tools, as\nwell as suggestions to overcome these limitations and ensure that students are\nusing these tools in a responsible and ethical manner.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (GenAI) \u6280\u8853\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u5c0d\u6559\u80b2\u9818\u57df\u7522\u751f\u4e86\u8b8a\u9769\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 ChatGPT \u548c Bard\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u6a23\u677f\u4efb\u52d9\u3001\u5275\u5efa\u500b\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b78\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8655\u7406\u91cd\u8907\u6027\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u9a30\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u6642\u9593\u9032\u884c\u5275\u9020\u6027\u601d\u8003\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u9580\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u65b9\u91dd\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8ca0\u8cac\u4efb\u6574\u5408\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0d\u4f86\u81ea\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u9580\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e03\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528 ChatGPT \u548c Bard \u7b49 GenAI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u8ad6\u6587\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790 (EDA)\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u5e7e\u500b\u4e3b\u984c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u4e3b\u984c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86 GenAI \u5de5\u5177\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u514b\u670d\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e26\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b78\u751f\u8ca0\u8cac\u4efb\u4e14\u5408\u4e4e\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u3002", "author": "Abhishek Kaushik et.al.", "authors": "Abhishek Kaushik, Sargam Yadav, Andrew Browne, David Lillis, David Williams, Jack Mc Donnell, Peadar Grant, Siobhan Connolly Kernan, Shubham Sharma, Mansi Arora", "id": "2501.10134v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10134v1", "repo": "null"}}

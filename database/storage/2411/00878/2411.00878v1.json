These small models able to\nproduce outputs that appear qualitatively similar to significantly larger\nmodels. However, one of the key limitations that have been observed with these\nmodels is their propensity to hallucinate significantly more often than larger\nmodels. In particular, they have been observed to generate coherent outputs\nthat involve factually incorrect information and spread misinformation,\ntoxicity, and stereotypes. There are many potential causes of hallucination, of\nwhich, one hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on data produced by a larger\nmodel leads to a knowledge mismatch which contributes to hallucination. In\nparticular, it is hypothesized that there is a mismatch between the knowledge\nthat is fed to the model to fine-tune it and the knowledge that is already\npresent in the graph. Fine-tuning the model on data that has such mismatch\ncould contribute to an increased propensity to hallucinate. We show that on an\nunseen test set, a smaller model fine-tuned on data generated from a larger\nmodel produced more wrong answers when compared to models fine-tuned on data\ncreated by the small model, which confirms the hypothesis.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7206\u70b8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u6d89\u53ca\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5e7b\u89c9\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9988\u9001\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u56fe\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u503e\u5411\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "author": "Phil Wee et.al.", "authors": "Phil Wee, Riyadh Baghdadi", "id": "2411.00878v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00878v1", "repo": "null"}}

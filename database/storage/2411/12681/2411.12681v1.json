There are two classifications in the\ndataset: normal and abnormal, along with extra noise fluctuations. In order to\nimprove the photographs' quality, undesirable artifacts, including visible\nmedical equipment at the edges, were eliminated using central cropping.\nAdjusting the brightness and contrast was one of the additional preprocessing\nprocesses. Normalization was then performed to normalize the data. To make\nclassification jobs easier, the dataset was methodically handled by combining\nseveral image subsets into two primary categories: normal and pathological. To\nprovide a strong training set that adapts well to real-world situations,\nsophisticated picture preprocessing techniques were used, such as contrast\nenhancement and real-time augmentation (including rotations, zooms, and\nbrightness modifications). To guarantee efficient model evaluation, the data\nwas subsequently divided into training and testing subsets. In order to create\nprecise and effective machine learning models for medical anomaly detection,\nhigh-quality input data is ensured via this thorough approach. Because of the\nproject pipeline's flexible and scalable design, it can be easily integrated\nwith bigger clinical decision-support systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u70ba\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u65bc\u7570\u5e38\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6b64\u5c08\u6848\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u9810\u8655\u7406\u3001\u589e\u5f37\u548c\u7d44\u7e54\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u6709\u5169\u500b\u5206\u985e\uff1a\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u7570\u5e38\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u984d\u5916\u7684\u96dc\u8a0a\u6ce2\u52d5\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7167\u7247\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u908a\u7de3\u53ef\u898b\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u8a2d\u5099\u5728\u5167\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u5df2\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u592e\u88c1\u5207\u4e88\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u3002\u8abf\u6574\u4eae\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5ea6\u662f\u984d\u5916\u9810\u8655\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\u57f7\u884c\u6b63\u898f\u5316\u4ee5\u6b63\u898f\u5316\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u4f7f\u5206\u985e\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u8f15\u9b06\uff0c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u900f\u904e\u5c07\u591a\u500b\u5f71\u50cf\u5b50\u96c6\u7d44\u5408\u6210\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u985e\u5225\uff08\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u75c5\u7406\uff09\u4f86\u6709\u689d\u7406\u5730\u8655\u7406\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u500b\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u9069\u61c9\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u6cc1\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5148\u9032\u7684\u5716\u7247\u9810\u8655\u7406\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5c0d\u6bd4\u589e\u5f37\u548c\u5373\u6642\u64f4\u5145\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65cb\u8f49\u3001\u7e2e\u653e\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u4fee\u6539\uff09\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u4fdd\u8b49\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u8cc7\u6599\u96a8\u5f8c\u88ab\u5206\u70ba\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6e2c\u8a66\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u5b78\u7570\u5e38\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u7cbe\u78ba\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u6b64\u5fb9\u5e95\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u78ba\u4fdd\u4e86\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5c08\u6848\u7ba1\u7dda\u7684\u9748\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f15\u9b06\u5730\u6574\u5408\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u6c7a\u7b56\u652f\u63f4\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Dharanidharan S I et.al.", "authors": "Dharanidharan S I, Suhitha Renuka S V, Ajishi Singh, Sheena Christabel Pravin", "id": "2411.12681v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12681v1", "repo": "null"}}

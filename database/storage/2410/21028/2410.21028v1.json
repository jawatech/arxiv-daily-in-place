Furthermore, Malta\nhas a rapid vehicle growth. Based on our research, the number of vehicles\nincreased by around 11,000 in a little more than 6 months, which shows how\nimportant it is to have an accurate and comprehensive means of collecting data\nto tackle the issue of fluctuating traffic in Malta. In this paper, we first\npresent the newly built comprehensive traffic dataset, called MalTra. This\ndataset includes realistic trips made by members of the public across the\nisland over a period of 200 days. We then describe the methodology we adopted\nto generate syntactic data to complete our data set as much as possible. In our\nresearch, we consider both MalTra and the Q-Traffic dataset, which has been\nused in several other research studies. The statistical ARIMA model and two\ngraph neural networks, the spatial temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN)\nand the diffusion convolutional recurrent network (DCRNN) were used to analyse\nand compare the results with existing research. From the evaluation, we found\nthat the DCRNN model outperforms the STGCN with the former resulting in MAE of\n3.98 (6.65 in the case of the latter) and a RMSE of 7.78 (against 12.73 of the\nlatter).", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u99ac\u723e\u4ed6\u9019\u500b\u5c0f\u5cf6\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u58c5\u585e\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u99ac\u723e\u4ed6\u70ba\u6b50\u76df\u4eba\u53e3\u6700\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u570b\u5bb6\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u7d04\u6709 1,672 \u540d\u5c45\u6c11\uff08\u6bcf\u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u91cc 4,331 \u540d\u5c45\u6c11\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u99ac\u723e\u4ed6\u7684\u8eca\u8f1b\u6210\u9577\u5feb\u901f\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8eca\u8f1b\u6578\u91cf\u5728\u77ed\u77ed 6 \u500b\u591a\u6708\u5167\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7d04 11,000 \u8f1b\uff0c\u9019\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u64c1\u6709\u6e96\u78ba\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c0d\u65bc\u89e3\u6c7a\u99ac\u723e\u4ed6\u4ea4\u901a\u6ce2\u52d5\u554f\u984c\u6709\u591a\u9ebc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5168\u9762\u4ea4\u901a\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba MalTra\u3002\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5305\u62ec 200 \u5929\u5167\u516c\u773e\u5728\u5cf6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u884c\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8aaa\u660e\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u53e5\u6cd5\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u76e1\u53ef\u80fd\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u540c\u6642\u8003\u616e\u4e86 MalTra \u548c Q-Traffic \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5f8c\u8005\u5df2\u7528\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7d71\u8a08 ARIMA \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5169\u500b\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u7a7a\u9593\u6642\u9593\u5716\u5f62\u5377\u7a4d\u7db2\u8def (STGCN) \u548c\u64f4\u6563\u5377\u7a4d\u905e\u8ff4\u7db2\u8def (DCRNN) \u7528\u65bc\u5206\u6790\u4e26\u5c07\u7d50\u679c\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u5f9e\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe DCRNN \u6a21\u578b\u512a\u65bc STGCN\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u7684 MAE \u70ba 3.98\uff08\u5f8c\u8005\u70ba 6.65\uff09\uff0cRMSE \u70ba 7.78\uff08\u5f8c\u8005\u70ba 12.73\uff09\u3002", "author": "Gabriele Borg et.al.", "authors": "Gabriele Borg, Charlie Abela", "id": "2410.21028v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21028v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2412.13943": {"publish_time": "2024-12-18", "title": "On Explaining Knowledge Distillation: Measuring and Visualising the Knowledge Transfer Process", "paper_summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) remains challenging due to the opaque nature of\nthe knowledge transfer process from a Teacher to a Student, making it difficult\nto address certain issues related to KD. To address this, we proposed UniCAM, a\nnovel gradient-based visual explanation method, which effectively interprets\nthe knowledge learned during KD. Our experimental results demonstrate that with\nthe guidance of the Teacher's knowledge, the Student model becomes more\nefficient, learning more relevant features while discarding those that are not\nrelevant. We refer to the features learned with the Teacher's guidance as\ndistilled features and the features irrelevant to the task and ignored by the\nStudent as residual features. Distilled features focus on key aspects of the\ninput, such as textures and parts of objects. In contrast, residual features\ndemonstrate more diffused attention, often targeting irrelevant areas,\nincluding the backgrounds of the target objects. In addition, we proposed two\nnovel metrics: the feature similarity score (FSS) and the relevance score (RS),\nwhich quantify the relevance of the distilled knowledge. Experiments on the\nCIFAR10, ASIRRA, and Plant Disease datasets demonstrate that UniCAM and the two\nmetrics offer valuable insights to explain the KD process.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\uff08KD\uff09\u7531\u65bc\u6559\u5e2b\u5230\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u50b3\u8f38\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u672c\u8cea\u800c\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u96e3\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u8207 KD \u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 UniCAM\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8996\u89ba\u89e3\u91cb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u91cb\u4e86 KD \u671f\u9593\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u5e2b\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8b8a\u5f97\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b78\u7fd2\u66f4\u591a\u76f8\u95dc\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u6368\u68c4\u4e0d\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5728\u6559\u5e2b\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u7a31\u70ba\u84b8\u993e\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u800c\u8207\u4efb\u52d9\u7121\u95dc\u4e14\u5b78\u751f\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u7a31\u70ba\u6b98\u5dee\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u84b8\u993e\u7279\u5fb5\u95dc\u6ce8\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7d0b\u7406\u548c\u7269\u9ad4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b98\u5dee\u7279\u5fb5\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u66f4\u5206\u6563\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u91dd\u5c0d\u7121\u95dc\u5340\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6a19\u7269\u9ad4\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u6307\u6a19\uff1a\u7279\u5fb5\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u6578\uff08FSS\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u5206\u6578\uff08RS\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u84b8\u993e\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u5728 CIFAR10\u3001ASIRRA \u548c\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniCAM \u548c\u9019\u5169\u500b\u6307\u6a19\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf6\u8cb4\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb KD \u904e\u7a0b\u3002", "author": "Gereziher Adhane et.al.", "authors": "Gereziher Adhane, Mohammad Mahdi Dehshibi, Dennis Vetter, David Masip, Gemma Roig", "id": "2412.13943v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13943v1", "repo": "null"}}

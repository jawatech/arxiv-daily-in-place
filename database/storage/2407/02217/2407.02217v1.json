In this work, we demonstrate how to address this triple\nchallenge by leveraging partial physical knowledge about the system dynamics.\nOur approach involves learning a physics-informed model to boost sample\nefficiency and generating imaginary trajectories from this model to learn a\nmodel-free policy and Q-function. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid planning\nstrategy, combining the learned policy and Q-function with the learned model to\nenhance time efficiency in planning. Through practical demonstrations, we\nillustrate that our method improves the compromise between sample efficiency,\ntime efficiency, and performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c07\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\n\u89e3\u6c7a\u6f38\u8fd1\u6548\u80fd\u3001\u6a23\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6b0a\u8861\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7d71\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u4e09\u91cd\u6311\u6230\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e00\u500b\u7269\u7406\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u63d0\u5347\u6a23\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e26\u5f9e\u9019\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u5047\u60f3\u8ecc\u8de1\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e00\u500b\u7121\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u548c Q \u51fd\u6578\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u6df7\u5408\u898f\u5283\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c07\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u548c Q \u51fd\u6578\u8207\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7d50\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u898f\u5283\u4e2d\u7684\u6642\u9593\u6548\u7387\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u969b\u793a\u7bc4\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8aaa\u660e\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a23\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6642\u9593\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Zakariae El Asri et.al.", "authors": "Zakariae El Asri, Olivier Sigaud, Nicolas Thome", "id": "2407.02217v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02217v1", "repo": "null"}}

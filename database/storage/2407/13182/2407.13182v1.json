{"2407.13182": {"publish_time": "2024-07-18", "title": "SpaDiT: Diffusion Transformer for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction using scRNA-seq", "paper_summary": "The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is\nrevolutionizing our understanding of the spatial organization of biological\ntissues. Current ST methods, categorized into next-generation sequencing-based\n(seq-based) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-based (image-based) methods,\noffer innovative insights into the functional dynamics of biological tissues.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their cellular resolution and the\nquantity of genes they can detect. To address these limitations, we propose\nSpaDiT, a deep learning method that utilizes a diffusion generative model to\nintegrate scRNA-seq and ST data for the prediction of undetected genes. By\nemploying a Transformer-based diffusion model, SpaDiT not only accurately\npredicts unknown genes but also effectively generates the spatial structure of\nST genes. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT through extensive\nexperiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. SpaDiT significantly\ncontributes to ST gene prediction methods with its innovative approach.\nCompared to eight leading baseline methods, SpaDiT achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple metrics, highlighting its substantial\nbioinformatics contribution.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7a7a\u9593\u8f49\u9304\u7d44\u5b78 (ST) \u6280\u8853\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u767c\u5c55\u6b63\u5728\u5fb9\u5e95\u6539\u8b8a\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u751f\u7269\u7d44\u7e54\u7a7a\u9593\u7d44\u7e54\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7576\u524d ST \u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u70ba\u57fa\u65bc\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u5b9a\u5e8f (seq-based) \u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u539f\u4f4d\u87a2\u5149\u96dc\u4ea4 (image-based) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u70ba\u751f\u7269\u7d44\u7e54\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u52d5\u529b\u5b78\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u7d30\u80de\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6aa2\u6e2c\u57fa\u56e0\u6578\u91cf\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 SpaDiT\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u64f4\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408 scRNA-seq \u548c ST \u6578\u64da\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u672a\u6aa2\u6e2c\u5230\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u3002\u901a\u904e\u63a1\u7528\u57fa\u65bc Transformer \u7684\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0cSpaDiT \u4e0d\u50c5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u9810\u6e2c\u672a\u77e5\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u9084\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210 ST \u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5c0d\u57fa\u65bc seq \u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u5f71\u50cf\u7684 ST \u6578\u64da\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86 SpaDiT \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002SpaDiT \u4ee5\u5176\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u986f\u8457\u8ca2\u737b\u4e86 ST \u57fa\u56e0\u9810\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8207\u516b\u7a2e\u9818\u5148\u7684\u57fa\u7dda\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSpaDiT \u5728\u591a\u9805\u6307\u6a19\u4e0a\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5b78\u4e0a\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8ca2\u737b\u3002", "author": "Xiaoyu Li et.al.", "authors": "Xiaoyu Li, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min", "id": "2407.13182v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13182v1", "repo": "null"}}

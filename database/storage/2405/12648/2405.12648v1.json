Previous SGG studies used a message-passing neural\nnetworks (MPNN) to update features, which can effectively reflect information\nabout surrounding objects. However, these studies have failed to reflect the\nco-occurrence of objects during SGG generation. In addition, they only\naddressed the long-tail problem of the training dataset from the perspectives\nof sampling and learning methods. To address these two problems, we propose\nCooK, which reflects the Co-occurrence Knowledge between objects, and the\nlearnable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-l-IDF) to solve the\nlong-tail problem. We applied the proposed model to the SGG benchmark dataset,\nand the results showed a performance improvement of up to 3.8% compared with\nexisting state-of-the-art models in SGGen subtask. The proposed method exhibits\ngeneralization ability from the results obtained, showing uniform performance\nimprovement for all MPNN models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5834\u666f\u5716\u751f\u6210\uff08SGG\uff09\u662f\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u8981\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5c07\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7269\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u5716\u5f62\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u8b93\u76f4\u89c0\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u95dc\u4fc2\u6210\u70ba\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684 SGG \u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u8a0a\u606f\u50b3\u905e\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff08MPNN\uff09\u4f86\u66f4\u65b0\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u5468\u570d\u7269\u9ad4\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u7269\u9ad4\u5728 SGG \u751f\u6210\u671f\u9593\u7684\u5171\u73fe\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u50c5\u5f9e\u53d6\u6a23\u548c\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u9577\u5c3e\u554f\u984c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u5169\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CooK\uff0c\u5b83\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7269\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5171\u73fe\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u8a5e\u983b-\u9006\u6587\u4ef6\u983b\u7387\uff08TF-l-IDF\uff09\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9577\u5c3e\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u61c9\u7528\u65bc SGG \u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u8207 SGGen \u5b50\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 3.8%\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f9e\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u6982\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u6240\u6709 MPNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u90fd\u6709\u5747\u52fb\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "author": "Hyeongjin Kim et.al.", "authors": "Hyeongjin Kim, Sangwon Kim, Dasom Ahn, Jong Taek Lee, Byoung Chul Ko", "id": "2405.12648v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12648v1", "repo": "null"}}

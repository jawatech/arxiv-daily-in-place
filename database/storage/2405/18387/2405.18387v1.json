Nevertheless, the\nperformance of CNN-based detection models is ambiguous when detection speed is\nconsidered. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been sufficient\nevaluation of the available methods in terms of the speed/accuracy trade-off in\nrelated literature. This work assesses the most fundamental object detection\nmodels on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset with respect to this\ntrade-off, their memory consumption, and computational and storage cost. Next,\nwe select a highly efficient model called YOLOv5 to train on the topical and\nunexplored dataset of human faces with medical masks, the Properly-Wearing\nMasked Faces Dataset (PWMFD), and analyze the benefits of specific optimization\ntechniques for real-time medical mask detection: transfer learning, data\naugmentations, and a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. Using our\nfindings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose an optimized model\nbased on YOLOv5s using transfer learning for the detection of correctly and\nincorrectly worn medical masks that surpassed more than two times in speed (69\nframes per second) the state-of-the-art model SE-YOLOv3 on the PWMFD dataset\nwhile maintaining the same level of mean Average Precision (67%).", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5377\u7a4d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (CNN) \u56e0\u5176\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u9ad8\u800c\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u76ee\u6a19\u5075\u6e2c\u554f\u984c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u8003\u91cf\u5075\u6e2c\u901f\u5ea6\u6642\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc CNN \u7684\u5075\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u537b\u6a21\u7a1c\u5169\u53ef\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u76f8\u95dc\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5c0d\u53ef\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6/\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u7684\u6b0a\u8861\u53d6\u6368\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91dd\u5c0d Common Objects in Context (COCO) \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u8a55\u4f30\u6700\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u5075\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u91cf\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6b0a\u8861\u53d6\u6368\u3001\u8a18\u61b6\u9ad4\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u904b\u7b97\u548c\u5132\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002\u63a5\u8457\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9078\u64c7\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba YOLOv5 \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u984c\u6027\u4e14\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4eba\u81c9\u6234\u91ab\u7528\u53e3\u7f69\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 Properly-Wearing Masked Faces Dataset (PWMFD) \u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6280\u8853\u5c0d\u5373\u6642\u91ab\u7528\u53e3\u7f69\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u512a\u9ede\uff1a\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u64f4\u5145\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca Squeeze-and-Excitation \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 COVID-19 \u75ab\u60c5\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u904b\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc YOLOv5s \u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u5075\u6e2c\u6b63\u78ba\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u914d\u6234\u7684\u91ab\u7528\u53e3\u7f69\uff0c\u5728 PWMFD \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 SE-YOLOv3 \u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u5169\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a (\u6bcf\u79d2 69 \u5e40)\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u7dad\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7b49\u7d1a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6 (67%)\u3002", "author": "Ioanna Gogou et.al.", "authors": "Ioanna Gogou, Dimitrios Koutsomitropoulos", "id": "2405.18387v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18387v1", "repo": "https://github.com/joangog/object-detection"}}

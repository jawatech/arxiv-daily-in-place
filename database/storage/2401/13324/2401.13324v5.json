{"2401.13324": {"publish_time": "2024-01-24", "title": "Information That Matters: Exploring Information Needs of People Affected by Algorithmic Decisions", "paper_summary": "Every AI system that makes decisions about people has a group of stakeholders\nthat are personally affected by these decisions. However, explanations of AI\nsystems rarely address the information needs of this stakeholder group, who\noften are AI novices. This creates a gap between conveyed information and\ninformation that matters to those who are impacted by the system's decisions,\nsuch as domain experts and decision subjects. To address this, we present the\n\"XAI Novice Question Bank,\" an extension of the XAI Question Bank containing a\ncatalog of information needs from AI novices in two use cases: employment\nprediction and health monitoring. The catalog covers the categories of data,\nsystem context, system usage, and system specifications. We gathered\ninformation needs through task-based interviews where participants asked\nquestions about two AI systems to decide on their adoption and received verbal\nexplanations in response. Our analysis showed that participants' confidence\nincreased after receiving explanations but that their understanding faced\nchallenges. These included difficulties in locating information and in\nassessing their own understanding, as well as attempts to outsource\nunderstanding. Additionally, participants' prior perceptions of the systems'\nrisks and benefits influenced their information needs. Participants who\nperceived high risks sought explanations about the intentions behind a system's\ndeployment, while those who perceived low risks rather asked about the system's\noperation. Our work aims to support the inclusion of AI novices in\nexplainability efforts by highlighting their information needs, aims, and\nchallenges. We summarize our findings as five key implications that can inform\nthe design of future explanations for lay stakeholder audiences.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6bcf\u500b\u5c0d\u4eba\u9032\u884c\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u7fa4\u500b\u4eba\u53d7\u5230\u9019\u4e9b\u6c7a\u7b56\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u95dc\u4fc2\u4eba\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cAI \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u8aaa\u660e\u5f88\u5c11\u91dd\u5c0d\u9019\u7fa4\u5229\u76ca\u95dc\u4fc2\u4eba\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u662f AI \u65b0\u624b\u3002\u9019\u5728\u50b3\u9054\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u548c\u5c0d\u53d7\u7cfb\u7d71\u6c7a\u7b56\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u9053\u9d3b\u6e9d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u548c\u6c7a\u7b56\u4e3b\u9ad4\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u300cXAI \u65b0\u624b\u554f\u984c\u5eab\u300d\uff0c\u9019\u662f XAI \u554f\u984c\u5eab\u7684\u5ef6\u4f38\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f86\u81ea\u5169\u500b\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d AI \u65b0\u624b\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\u76ee\u9304\uff1a\u5c31\u696d\u9810\u6e2c\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u76e3\u63a7\u3002\u76ee\u9304\u6db5\u84cb\u4e86\u8cc7\u6599\u3001\u7cfb\u7d71\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u7cfb\u7d71\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7cfb\u7d71\u898f\u683c\u7b49\u985e\u5225\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u4efb\u52d9\u578b\u8a2a\u8ac7\u6536\u96c6\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u8a62\u554f\u4e86\u5169\u500b AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c7a\u5b9a\u63a1\u7528\u8207\u5426\uff0c\u4e26\u6536\u5230\u53e3\u982d\u8aaa\u660e\u4f5c\u70ba\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5206\u6790\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u5728\u6536\u5230\u8aaa\u660e\u5f8c\uff0c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u9762\u81e8\u6311\u6230\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u5305\u62ec\u96e3\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u8cc7\u8a0a\u548c\u8a55\u4f30\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8a66\u5716\u5916\u5305\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u5c0d\u7cfb\u7d71\u98a8\u96aa\u548c\u597d\u8655\u7684\u5148\u524d\u8a8d\u77e5\u5f71\u97ff\u4e86\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8a8d\u70ba\u98a8\u96aa\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u5c0b\u6c42\u6709\u95dc\u7cfb\u7d71\u90e8\u7f72\u80cc\u5f8c\u610f\u5716\u7684\u8aaa\u660e\uff0c\u800c\u8a8d\u70ba\u98a8\u96aa\u4f4e\u7684\u4eba\u5247\u8a62\u554f\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u904b\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u900f\u904e\u5f37\u8abf\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u76ee\u6a19\u548c\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f86\u652f\u6301\u5c07 AI \u65b0\u624b\u7d0d\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u7e3d\u7d50\u70ba\u4e94\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5f71\u97ff\u53ef\u4ee5\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u91dd\u5c0d\u975e\u5c08\u696d\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u95dc\u8005\u53d7\u773e\u7684\u8aaa\u660e\u8a2d\u8a08\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c3\u8003\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Timoth\u00e9e Schmude et.al.", "authors": "Timoth\u00e9e Schmude, Laura Koesten, Torsten M\u00f6ller, Sebastian Tschiatschek", "id": "2401.13324v5", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13324v5", "repo": "null"}}

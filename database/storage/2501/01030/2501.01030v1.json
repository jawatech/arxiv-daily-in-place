{"2501.01030": {"publish_time": "2025-01-02", "title": "Reasoning based on symbolic and parametric knowledge bases: a survey", "paper_summary": "Reasoning is fundamental to human intelligence, and critical for\nproblem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Reasoning refers to\ndrawing new conclusions based on existing knowledge, which can support various\napplications like clinical diagnosis, basic education, and financial analysis.\nThough a good number of surveys have been proposed for reviewing\nreasoning-related methods, none of them has systematically investigated these\nmethods from the viewpoint of their dependent knowledge base. Both the\nscenarios to which the knowledge bases are applied and their storage formats\nare significantly different. Hence, investigating reasoning methods from the\nknowledge base perspective helps us better understand the challenges and future\ndirections. To fill this gap, this paper first classifies the knowledge base\ninto symbolic and parametric ones. The former explicitly stores information in\nhuman-readable symbols, and the latter implicitly encodes knowledge within\nparameters. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of reasoning methods\nusing symbolic knowledge bases, parametric knowledge bases, and both of them.\nFinally, we identify the future direction toward enhancing reasoning\ncapabilities to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6307\u6839\u636e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f97\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8c03\u67e5\u6765\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u7684\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u5176\u5b58\u50a8\u683c\u5f0f\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u7740\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4ece\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5206\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002\u524d\u8005\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u660e\u786e\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8005\u5219\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6982\u8ff0\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u4eba\u548c\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Mayi Xu et.al.", "authors": "Mayi Xu, Yunfeng Ning, Yongqi Li, Jianhao Chen, Jintao Wen, Yao Xiao, Shen Zhou, Birong Pan, Zepeng Bao, Xin Miao, Hankun Kang, Ke Sun, Tieyun Qian", "id": "2501.01030v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01030v1", "repo": "null"}}

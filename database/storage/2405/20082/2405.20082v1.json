However, non-adjacent sections\nof real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly we raise\nthe question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could\nenable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a\nsimple plug-and-play mechanism called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3)\ndesigned to improve time-series representation learning of existing models. S3\nworks by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and\nshuffling them in a learned manner that is the most optimal for the task at\nhand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a\nlearned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled\nsequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to\ncreate various degrees of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural\narchitectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation\noverhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and\nstate-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in\nsignificant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification and\nforecasting, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\\%. We also\nshow that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve\nand loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

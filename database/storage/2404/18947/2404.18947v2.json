{"2404.18947": {"publish_time": "2024-04-27", "title": "Multimodal Fusion on Low-quality Data: A Comprehensive Survey", "paper_summary": "Multimodal fusion focuses on integrating information from multiple modalities\nwith the goal of more accurate prediction, which has achieved remarkable\nprogress in a wide range of scenarios, including autonomous driving and medical\ndiagnosis. However, the reliability of multimodal fusion remains largely\nunexplored especially under low-quality data settings. This paper surveys the\ncommon challenges and recent advances of multimodal fusion in the wild and\npresents them in a comprehensive taxonomy. From a data-centric view, we\nidentify four main challenges that are faced by multimodal fusion on\nlow-quality data, namely (1) noisy multimodal data that are contaminated with\nheterogeneous noises, (2) incomplete multimodal data that some modalities are\nmissing, (3) imbalanced multimodal data that the qualities or properties of\ndifferent modalities are significantly different and (4) quality-varying\nmultimodal data that the quality of each modality dynamically changes with\nrespect to different samples. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to\nunderstand the state of the field and identify several potential directions. We\nalso provide discussion for the open problems in this field together with\ninteresting future research directions.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Qingyang Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Qingyang Zhang,Yake Wei,Zongbo Han,Huazhu Fu,Xi Peng,Cheng Deng,Qinghua Hu,Cai Xu,Jie Wen,Di Hu,Changqing Zhang", "id": "2404.18947v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18947v2", "repo": "null"}}

These models have shown promise in assisting clinicians and\nproviding support to individuals experiencing various psychological challenges.\n  Objective: This study aims to compare the performance of two large language\nmodels, GPT-4 and Chat-GPT, in responding to a set of 18 psychological prompts,\nto assess their potential applicability in mental health care settings.\n  Methods: A blind methodology was employed, with a clinical psychologist\nevaluating the models' responses without knowledge of their origins. The\nprompts encompassed a diverse range of mental health topics, including\ndepression, anxiety, and trauma, to ensure a comprehensive assessment.\n  Results: The results demonstrated a significant difference in performance\nbetween the two models (p > 0.05). GPT-4 achieved an average rating of 8.29 out\nof 10, while Chat-GPT received an average rating of 6.52. The clinical\npsychologist's evaluation suggested that GPT-4 was more effective at generating\nclinically relevant and empathetic responses, thereby providing better support\nand guidance to potential users.\n  Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the\napplicability of large language models in mental health care settings. The\nfindings underscore the importance of continued research and development in the\nfield to optimize these models for clinical use. Further investigation is\nnecessary to understand the specific factors underlying the performance\ndifferences between the two models and to explore their generalizability across\nvarious populations and mental health conditions.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9032\u5c55\u5e36\u52d5\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u9769\u65b0\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7167\u8b77\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5728\u5354\u52a9\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u5e2b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u63f4\u7d66\u7d93\u6b77\u5404\u7a2e\u5fc3\u7406\u6311\u6230\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002\n\u76ee\u6a19\uff1a\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f03\u5169\u500b\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGPT-4 \u548c Chat-GPT\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u61c9\u4e00\u7d44 18 \u500b\u5fc3\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u6642\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7167\u8b77\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u9069\u7528\u6027\u3002\n\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u63a1\u7528\u76f2\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7531\u81e8\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u5e2b\u5728\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u6db5\u84cb\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e3b\u984c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u3001\u7126\u616e\u75c7\u548c\u5275\u50b7\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u9032\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\n\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u5169\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6709\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u7570 (p > 0.05)\u3002GPT-4 \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8a55\u5206\u70ba 10 \u5206\u4e2d\u7684 8.29 \u5206\uff0c\u800c Chat-GPT \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8a55\u5206\u70ba 6.52 \u5206\u3002\u81e8\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u5e2b\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0cGPT-4 \u5728\u7522\u751f\u8207\u81e8\u5e8a\u76f8\u95dc\u4e14\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u70ba\u6f5b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6307\u5c0e\u3002\n\u7d50\u8ad6\uff1a\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u64f4\u5145\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7167\u8b77\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u9069\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6587\u737b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u6301\u7e8c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u767c\u5c55\u5728\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4f9b\u81e8\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u5c0d\u65bc\u4e86\u89e3\u5c0e\u81f4\u5169\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u9593\u8868\u73fe\u5dee\u7570\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u65cf\u7fa4\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u62ec\u6027\uff0c\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Birger Moell et.al.", "authors": "Birger Moell", "id": "2405.09300v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09300v1", "repo": "null"}}

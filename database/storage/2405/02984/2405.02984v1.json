The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and\nincludes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language,\nposes unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a\nvocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less\nthan five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges:\nthe Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based\nTransformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and\n3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing\nbenchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in\nBLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%. Additionally, we\nbenchmarked our model using the well-known PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset to\nvalidate our approach.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc \u00d6zt\u00fcrk et.al.", "authors": "\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc \u00d6zt\u00fcrk,Hacer Yalim Keles", "id": "2405.02984v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02984v1", "repo": "null"}}

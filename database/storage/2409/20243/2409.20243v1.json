Detecting whether users\nexpress suicidal ideation in text-based counseling services is crucial for\nidentifying and prioritizing at-risk individuals. However, the lack of\ndomain-specific systems to facilitate fine-grained suicide detection and\ncorresponding risk assessment in online counseling poses a significant\nchallenge for automated crisis intervention aimed at suicide prevention. In\nthis paper, we propose PsyGUARD, an automated system for detecting suicide\nideation and assessing risk in psychological counseling. To achieve this, we\nfirst develop a detailed taxonomy for detecting suicide ideation based on\nfoundational theories. We then curate a large-scale, high-quality dataset\ncalled PsySUICIDE for suicide detection. To evaluate the capabilities of\nautomated systems in fine-grained suicide detection, we establish a range of\nbaselines. Subsequently, to assist automated services in providing safe,\nhelpful, and tailored responses for further assessment, we propose to build a\nsuite of risk assessment frameworks. Our study not only provides an insightful\nanalysis of the effectiveness of automated risk assessment systems based on\nfine-grained suicide detection but also highlights their potential to improve\nmental health services on online counseling platforms.

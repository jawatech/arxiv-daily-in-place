While numerous evaluation benchmarks\nhave been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions.\nHowever, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by\ninstruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their\ninstruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the\nIntention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs'\ncapacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by\nextraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify\nthe appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given\ncontext. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art\nmodels still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the\nproposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the\nseveral strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u512a\u52e2\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u900f\u904e\u7522\u751f\u9069\u7576\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u4f86\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u56de\u61c9\u7d66\u5b9a\u7684\u6307\u793a\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u80fd\u529b\u7a31\u70ba\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u70ba LLM \u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u9818\u57df\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4e26\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5df2\u7d93\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u8a31\u591a\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6578\u50c5\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u660e\u78ba\u4e14\u9023\u8cab\u7684\u6307\u793a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6ce8\u610f\u5230 LLM \u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6307\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u9673\u8ff0\u5206\u6563\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u5ffd\u8996\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6307\u793a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6307\u793a\u610f\u5716 (IoInst) \u57fa\u6e96\u3002\u6b64\u57fa\u6e96\u8a55\u4f30 LLM \u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u5230\u984d\u5916\u6307\u793a\u8aa4\u5c0e\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5c08\u6ce8\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6307\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u57fa\u6e96\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u8b58\u5225\u9069\u7576\u7684\u6307\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u6307\u5c0e\u7d66\u5b9a\u5167\u5bb9\u7684\u7522\u751f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u8fd1\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u793a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 IoInst \u547d\u984c\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5c0d\u53ef\u80fd\u9069\u7528\u65bc IoInst \u7684\u5e7e\u7a2e\u7b56\u7565\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5206\u6790\u3002", "author": "Hyeonseok Moon et.al.", "authors": "Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Seungyoon Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim", "id": "2412.19450v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19450v1", "repo": "null"}}

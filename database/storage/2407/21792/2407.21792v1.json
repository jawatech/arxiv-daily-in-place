However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and\ninconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can\ncontribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship\nbetween AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general\nknowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive\nmeta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation\nwith general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of\nexisting directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety\nbenchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially\nenabling \"safetywashing\" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as\nsafety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical\nfoundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety\nin a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research\ngoals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In\ndoing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research,\nadvancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards\nmeasurable progress.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7cfb\u7d71\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5f37\u5927\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u300cAI \u5b89\u5168\u300d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8208\u8da3\u4e5f\u8207\u65e5\u4ff1\u589e\uff0c\u4ee5\u56e0\u61c9\u65b0\u8208\u548c\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cAI \u5b89\u5168\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u6a19\u6e96\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u51fa\u8ca2\u737b\u611f\u5230\u56f0\u60d1\u3002AI \u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u6e96\u8207\u4e0a\u6e38\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4e00\u822c\u77e5\u8b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2\u4e0d\u660e\u78ba\uff0c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5287\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d AI \u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u6e96\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5f8c\u8a2d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u6578\u5341\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u5be6\u8b49\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u5011\u8207\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d AI \u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u9032\u884c\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u6e96\u8207\u4e0a\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u95dc\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u300c\u5b89\u5168\u6f02\u767d\u300d\u2014\u2014\u5c07\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u8aa4\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u6839\u64da\u9019\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5be6\u8b49\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u958b\u767c\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7814\u7a76\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5c07 AI \u5b89\u5168\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u4e00\u7d44\u660e\u78ba\u754c\u5b9a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u76ee\u6a19\u5728\u5be6\u8b49\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8207\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u5340\u5206\u958b\u4f86\u3002\u900f\u904e\u9019\u9ebc\u505a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u65e8\u5728\u70ba AI \u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u500b\u66f4\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u63a8\u9032\u5b89\u5168\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u79d1\u5b78\uff0c\u4e26\u91d0\u6e05\u9081\u5411\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u9032\u5c55\u7684\u9053\u8def\u3002", "author": "Richard Ren et.al.", "authors": "Richard Ren, Steven Basart, Adam Khoja, Alice Gatti, Long Phan, Xuwang Yin, Mantas Mazeika, Alexander Pan, Gabriel Mukobi, Ryan H.

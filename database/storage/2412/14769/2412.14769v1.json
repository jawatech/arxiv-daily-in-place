Early screening\nand identification of at-risk LBCs is crucial, yet challenging due to the\nsevere shortage of mental health professionals, especially in rural areas.\nWhile the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test shows higher child participation rates,\nits requirement for expert interpretation limits its application in\nresource-scarce regions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyDraw, a\nmulti-agent system based on Multimodal Large Language Models that assists\nmental health professionals in analyzing HTP drawings. The system employs\nspecialized agents for feature extraction and psychological interpretation,\noperating in two stages: comprehensive feature analysis and professional report\ngeneration. Evaluation of HTP drawings from 290 primary school students reveals\nthat 71.03% of the analyzes achieved High Consistency with professional\nevaluations, 26.21% Moderate Consistency and only 2.41% Low Consistency. The\nsystem identified 31.03% of cases requiring professional attention,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness as a preliminary screening tool. Currently\ndeployed in pilot schools, \\method shows promise in supporting mental health\nprofessionals, particularly in resource-limited areas, while maintaining high\nprofessional standards in psychological assessment.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7559\u5b88\u513f\u7ae5\uff08LBC\uff09\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u8d85\u8fc7 6600 \u4e07\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7236\u6bcd\u5916\u51fa\u52a1\u5de5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5371 LBC \u8fdb\u884c\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u4e25\u91cd\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5374\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u623f\u6811\u4eba\uff08HTP\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u513f\u7ae5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 PsyDraw\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u534f\u52a9\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u5206\u6790 HTP \u56fe\u753b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a\u7efc\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5bf9 290 \u540d\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u7684 HTP \u56fe\u753b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c71.03% \u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c26.21% \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u4ec5 2.41% \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa 31.03% \u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5df2\u5728\u8bd5\u70b9\u5b66\u6821\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "author": "Yiqun Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yiqun Zhang, Xiaocui Yang, Xiaobai Li, Siyuan Yu, Yi Luan, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang", "id": "2412.14769v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14769v1", "repo": "https://github.com/LYiHub/psydraw"}}

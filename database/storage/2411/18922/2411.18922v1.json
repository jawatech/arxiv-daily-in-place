The use of spoken language-based AD detection\nmethods has gained prevalence due to their scalability due to their\nscalability. Based on the Cookie Theft picture description task, we devised an\nexplainable and effective feature set that leverages the visual capabilities of\na large language model (LLM) and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF-IDF) model. Our experimental results show that the newly proposed features\nconsistently outperform traditional linguistic features across two different\nclassifiers with high dimension efficiency. Our new features can be well\nexplained and interpreted step by step which enhance the interpretability of\nautomatic AD screening.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u963f\u8332\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7 (AD) \u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u9ad8\u9f61\u5316\u793e\u6703\u4e2d\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6311\u6230\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u5176\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u53e3\u8a9e\u7684 AD \u6aa2\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7372\u5f97\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6839\u64da Cookie Theft \u5716\u7247\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u96c6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u8996\u89ba\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u8a5e\u983b-\u9006\u5411\u6587\u4ef6\u983b\u7387 (TF-IDF) \u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u5728\u5169\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u985e\u5668\u4e2d\u59cb\u7d42\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u8a9e\u8a00\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u8a6e\u91cb\uff0c\u9019\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u81ea\u52d5 AD \u7be9\u6aa2\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u3002", "author": "Junan Li et.al.", "authors": "Junan Li, Yunxiang Li, Yuren Wang, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng", "id": "2411.18922v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18922v1", "repo": "null"}}

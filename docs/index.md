##### **Region-specific Risk Quantification for Interpretable Prognosis of COVID-19**
2405.02815v1 by Zhusi Zhong,Jie Li,Zhuoqi Ma,Scott Collins,Harrison Bai,Paul Zhang,Terrance Healey,Xinbo Gao,Michael K. Atalay,Zhicheng Jiao

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global public health, necessitating
accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce
mortality rates. This paper introduces an interpretable deep survival
prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in
COVID-19 prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. By integrating a large-scale
pretrained image encoder, Risk-specific Grad-CAM, and anatomical region
detection techniques, our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes
that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but
critical abnormal regions. Our model's predictive results provide enhanced
clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to
make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with better understanding
of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center
survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and
qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and
time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our
explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival
analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical
decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.

##### **M3H: Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare**
2404.18975v1 by Dimitris Bertsimas,Yu Ma

Recent breakthroughs in AI are poised to fundamentally enhance our study and
understanding of healthcare. The development of an integrated many-to-many
framework that leverages multiple data modality inputs for the analytical
modeling of multiple medical tasks, is critical for a unified understanding of
modern medicine. In this work, we introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal
Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning
from diverse multimodal inputs across a broad spectrum of medical task
categories and machine learning problem classes. The modular design of the
framework ensures its generalizable data processing, task definition, and rapid
model prototyping, applicable to both clinical and operational healthcare
settings. We evaluate the M3H framework by validating models trained from four
modalities (tabular, time-series, language, and vision) on 41 medical tasks
across 4 machine learning problem classes. Our results demonstrate that M3H
consistently produces multitask models that outperform canonical single-task
models (by 1.1- 37.2%) across 37 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments,
three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task: spanning
ML problem classes of supervised binary classification, multiclass
classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally, the framework
introduces a novel attention mechanism to balance self-exploitation (focus on
learning source task), and cross-exploration (encourage learning from other
tasks). Furthermore, M3H provides explainability insights on how joint learning
of additional tasks impacts the learning of source task using a proposed TIM
score, shedding light into the dynamics of task interdependencies. Its
adaptable architecture facilitates the customization and integration,
establishing it as a robust and scalable candidate solution for future
AI-driven healthcare systems.

##### **Advancing Healthcare Automation: Multi-Agent Systems for Medical Necessity Justification**
2404.17977v1 by Himanshu Pandey,Akhil Amod,Shivang

This paper explores the application of Swarm-Structured Multi-Agent Systems
(MAS) to establish medical necessity, a process that involves a systematic
review of patient-specific medical structured and unstructured data against
clinical guidelines. We addressed this complex task by decomposing it into
smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is handled by a specialized
AI agent. We conduct a systematic study of the impact of various prompting
strategies on these agents and benchmark different Large Language Models (LLMs)
to determine their accuracy in completing these tasks. Additionally, we
investigate how these agents can provide explainability, thereby enhancing
trust and transparency within the system.

##### **Rad4XCNN: a new agnostic method for post-hoc global explanation of CNN-derived features by means of radiomics**
2405.02334v1 by Francesco Prinzi,Carmelo Militello,Calogero Zarcaro,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta,Salvatore Gaglio,Salvatore Vitabile

In the last years, artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical decision support
systems (CDSS) played a key role in harnessing machine learning and deep
learning architectures. Despite their promising capabilities, the lack of
transparency and explainability of AI models poses significant challenges,
particularly in medical contexts where reliability is a mandatory aspect.
Achieving transparency without compromising predictive accuracy remains a key
challenge. This paper presents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the
predictive power of CNN-derived features with the interpretability inherent in
radiomic features. Rad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on
saliency map, by associating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by
means of Radiomics, offering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond
visualization maps. Using a breast cancer classification task as a case study,
we evaluated Rad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online
dataset and two in-house datasets for internal and external validation. Some
key results are: i) CNN-derived features guarantee more robust accuracy when
compared against ViT-derived and radiomic features; ii) conventional
visualization map methods for explanation present several pitfalls; iii)
Rad4XCNN does not sacrifice model accuracy for their explainability; iv)
Rad4XCNN provides global explanation insights enabling the physician to analyze
the model outputs and findings. In addition, we highlight the importance of
integrating interpretability into AI models for enhanced trust and adoption in
clinical practice, emphasizing how our method can mitigate some concerns
related to explainable AI methods.

##### **Attributing Responsibility in AI-Induced Incidents: A Computational Reflective Equilibrium Framework for Accountability**
2404.16957v1 by Yunfei Ge,Quanyan Zhu

The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced
complex challenges in the responsibility and accountability in the event of
incidents involving AI-enabled systems. The interconnectivity of these systems,
ethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI
technology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional
responsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a
Computational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and
ethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders.
The computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the
limitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted
scenarios, showcasing the framework's explainability, coherence, and adaptivity
properties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal
role of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium
computation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case
study, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse
responsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into
accountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a
sustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and
reflection.

##### **Explainable AI for Fair Sepsis Mortality Predictive Model**
2404.13139v1 by Chia-Hsuan Chang,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang

Artificial intelligence supports healthcare professionals with predictive
modeling, greatly transforming clinical decision-making. This study addresses
the crucial need for fairness and explainability in AI applications within
healthcare to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient demographics. By
focusing on the predictive modeling of sepsis-related mortality, we propose a
method that learns a performance-optimized predictive model and then employs
the transfer learning process to produce a model with better fairness. Our
method also introduces a novel permutation-based feature importance algorithm
aiming at elucidating the contribution of each feature in enhancing fairness on
predictions. Unlike existing explainability methods concentrating on explaining
feature contribution to predictive performance, our proposed method uniquely
bridges the gap in understanding how each feature contributes to fairness. This
advancement is pivotal, given sepsis's significant mortality rate and its role
in one-third of hospital deaths. Our method not only aids in identifying and
mitigating biases within the predictive model but also fosters trust among
healthcare stakeholders by improving the transparency and fairness of model
predictions, thereby contributing to more equitable and trustworthy healthcare
delivery.

##### **Multi Class Depression Detection Through Tweets using Artificial Intelligence**
2404.13104v1 by Muhammad Osama Nusrat,Waseem Shahzad,Saad Ahmed Jamal

Depression is a significant issue nowadays. As per the World Health
Organization (WHO), in 2023, over 280 million individuals are grappling with
depression. This is a huge number; if not taken seriously, these numbers will
increase rapidly. About 4.89 billion individuals are social media users. People
express their feelings and emotions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook,
Reddit, Instagram, etc. These platforms contain valuable information which can
be used for research purposes. Considerable research has been conducted across
various social media platforms. However, certain limitations persist in these
endeavors. Particularly, previous studies were only focused on detecting
depression and the intensity of depression in tweets. Also, there existed
inaccuracies in dataset labeling. In this research work, five types of
depression (Bipolar, major, psychotic, atypical, and postpartum) were predicted
using tweets from the Twitter database based on lexicon labeling. Explainable
AI was used to provide reasoning by highlighting the parts of tweets that
represent type of depression. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) was used for feature extraction and training. Machine
learning and deep learning methodologies were used to train the model. The BERT
model presented the most promising results, achieving an overall accuracy of
0.96.

##### **COIN: Counterfactual inpainting for weakly supervised semantic segmentation for medical images**
2404.12832v1 by Dmytro Shvetsov,Joonas Ariva,Marharyta Domnich,Raul Vicente,Dmytro Fishman

Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and
radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images,
including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of
deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by
the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the
capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through
the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations.
The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting
approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to
normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an
input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the
generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the
classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce
precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing
segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are
substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and
actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in
Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established
attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an
alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al. This
evidence suggests that COIN is a promising approach for semantic segmentation
of tumors in CT images, and presents a step forward in making deep learning
applications more accessible and effective in healthcare, where annotated data
is scarce.

##### **Advancements in Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis**
2404.07239v1 by Milad Yousefi,Shadi Farabi Maleki,Ali Jafarizadeh,Mahya Ahmadpour Youshanlui,Aida Jafari,Siamak Pedrammehr,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Ryszard Tadeusiewicz,Pawel Plawiak

Thyroid cancer is an increasing global health concern that requires advanced
diagnostic methods. The application of AI and radiomics to thyroid cancer
diagnosis is examined in this review. A review of multiple databases was
conducted in compliance with PRISMA guidelines until October 2023. A
combination of keywords led to the discovery of an English academic publication
on thyroid cancer and related subjects. 267 papers were returned from the
original search after 109 duplicates were removed. Relevant studies were
selected according to predetermined criteria after 124 articles were eliminated
based on an examination of their abstract and title. After the comprehensive
analysis, an additional six studies were excluded. Among the 28 included
studies, radiomics analysis, which incorporates ultrasound (US) images,
demonstrated its effectiveness in diagnosing thyroid cancer. Various results
were noted, some of the studies presenting new strategies that outperformed the
status quo. The literature has emphasized various challenges faced by AI
models, including interpretability issues, dataset constraints, and operator
dependence. The synthesized findings of the 28 included studies mentioned the
need for standardization efforts and prospective multicenter studies to address
these concerns. Furthermore, approaches to overcome these obstacles were
identified, such as advances in explainable AI technology and personalized
medicine techniques. The review focuses on how AI and radiomics could transform
the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Despite challenges, future
research on multidisciplinary cooperation, clinical applicability validation,
and algorithm improvement holds the potential to improve patient outcomes and
diagnostic precision in the treatment of thyroid cancer.

##### **Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Classification in the Context of Bangladeshi Patients: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach with Explainable AI**
2404.04686v1 by Taminul Islam,Md. Alif Sheakh,Mst. Sazia Tahosin,Most. Hasna Hena,Shopnil Akash,Yousef A. Bin Jardan,Gezahign Fentahun Wondmie,Hiba-Allah Nafidi,Mohammed Bourhia

Breast cancer has rapidly increased in prevalence in recent years, making it
one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Among all cancers, it is by
far the most common. Diagnosing this illness manually requires significant time
and expertise. Since detecting breast cancer is a time-consuming process,
preventing its further spread can be aided by creating machine-based forecasts.
Machine learning and Explainable AI are crucial in classification as they not
only provide accurate predictions but also offer insights into how the model
arrives at its decisions, aiding in the understanding and trustworthiness of
the classification results. In this study, we evaluate and compare the
classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 scores of five different
machine learning methods using a primary dataset (500 patients from Dhaka
Medical College Hospital). Five different supervised machine learning
techniques, including decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, naive
bayes, and XGBoost, have been used to achieve optimal results on our dataset.
Additionally, this study applied SHAP analysis to the XGBoost model to
interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of each feature on
the model's output. We compared the accuracy with which several algorithms
classified the data, as well as contrasted with other literature in this field.
After final evaluation, this study found that XGBoost achieved the best model
accuracy, which is 97%.

##### **Enhancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Mammography: Evaluation and Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks and Explainable AI**
2404.03892v3 by Maryam Ahmed,Tooba Bibi,Rizwan Ahmed Khan,Sidra Nasir

The Deep learning (DL) models for diagnosing breast cancer from mammographic
images often operate as "black boxes", making it difficult for healthcare
professionals to trust and understand their decision-making processes. The
study presents an integrated framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the enhanced diagnosis
of breast cancer using the CBIS-DDSM dataset. The methodology encompasses an
elaborate data preprocessing pipeline and advanced data augmentation techniques
to counteract dataset limitations and transfer learning using pre-trained
networks such as VGG-16, Inception-V3 and ResNet was employed. A focal point of
our study is the evaluation of XAI's effectiveness in interpreting model
predictions, highlighted by utilizing the Hausdorff measure to assess the
alignment between AI-generated explanations and expert annotations
quantitatively. This approach is critical for XAI in promoting trustworthiness
and ethical fairness in AI-assisted diagnostics. The findings from our research
illustrate the effective collaboration between CNNs and XAI in advancing
diagnostic methods for breast cancer, thereby facilitating a more seamless
integration of advanced AI technologies within clinical settings. By enhancing
the interpretability of AI driven decisions, this work lays the groundwork for
improved collaboration between AI systems and medical practitioners, ultimately
enriching patient care. Furthermore, the implications of our research extended
well beyond the current methodologies. It encourages further research into how
to combine multimodal data and improve AI explanations to meet the needs of
clinical practice.

##### **Addressing Social Misattributions of Large Language Models: An HCXAI-based Approach**
2403.17873v1 by Andrea Ferrario,Alberto Termine,Alessandro Facchini

Human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) advocates for the integration of social
aspects into AI explanations. Central to the HCXAI discourse is the Social
Transparency (ST) framework, which aims to make the socio-organizational
context of AI systems accessible to their users. In this work, we suggest
extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in
Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental
health. In fact LLMs, which are remarkably capable of simulating roles and
personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users'
perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and
dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To
address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth
'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by
its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM
capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible
development and use of LLM-based technology.

##### **Clinical Domain Knowledge-Derived Template Improves Post Hoc AI Explanations in Pneumothorax Classification**
2403.18871v1 by Han Yuan,Chuan Hong,Pengtao Jiang,Gangming Zhao,Nguyen Tuan Anh Tran,Xinxing Xu,Yet Yen Yan,Nan Liu

Background: Pneumothorax is an acute thoracic disease caused by abnormal air
collection between the lungs and chest wall. To address the opaqueness often
associated with deep learning (DL) models, explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been introduced to outline regions related to pneumothorax
diagnoses made by DL models. However, these explanations sometimes diverge from
actual lesion areas, highlighting the need for further improvement. Method: We
propose a template-guided approach to incorporate the clinical knowledge of
pneumothorax into model explanations generated by XAI methods, thereby
enhancing the quality of these explanations. Utilizing one lesion delineation
created by radiologists, our approach first generates a template that
represents potential areas of pneumothorax occurrence. This template is then
superimposed on model explanations to filter out extraneous explanations that
fall outside the template's boundaries. To validate its efficacy, we carried
out a comparative analysis of three XAI methods with and without our template
guidance when explaining two DL models in two real-world datasets. Results: The
proposed approach consistently improved baseline XAI methods across twelve
benchmark scenarios built on three XAI methods, two DL models, and two
datasets. The average incremental percentages, calculated by the performance
improvements over the baseline performance, were 97.8% in Intersection over
Union (IoU) and 94.1% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) when comparing model
explanations and ground-truth lesion areas. Conclusions: In the context of
pneumothorax diagnoses, we proposed a template-guided approach for improving AI
explanations. We anticipate that our template guidance will forge a fresh
approach to elucidating AI models by integrating clinical domain expertise.

##### **Enhancing Neural Machine Translation of Low-Resource Languages: Corpus Development, Human Evaluation and Explainable AI Architectures**
2403.01580v1 by Séamus Lankford

In the current machine translation (MT) landscape, the Transformer
architecture stands out as the gold standard, especially for high-resource
language pairs. This research delves into its efficacy for low-resource
language pairs including both the English$\leftrightarrow$Irish and
English$\leftrightarrow$Marathi language pairs. Notably, the study identifies
the optimal hyperparameters and subword model type to significantly improve the
translation quality of Transformer models for low-resource language pairs.
  The scarcity of parallel datasets for low-resource languages can hinder MT
development. To address this, gaHealth was developed, the first bilingual
corpus of health data for the Irish language. Focusing on the health domain,
models developed using this in-domain dataset exhibited very significant
improvements in BLEU score when compared with models from the LoResMT2021
Shared Task. A subsequent human evaluation using the multidimensional quality
metrics error taxonomy showcased the superior performance of the Transformer
system in reducing both accuracy and fluency errors compared to an RNN-based
counterpart.
  Furthermore, this thesis introduces adaptNMT and adaptMLLM, two open-source
applications streamlined for the development, fine-tuning, and deployment of
neural machine translation models. These tools considerably simplify the setup
and evaluation process, making MT more accessible to both developers and
translators. Notably, adaptNMT, grounded in the OpenNMT ecosystem, promotes
eco-friendly natural language processing research by highlighting the
environmental footprint of model development. Fine-tuning of MLLMs by adaptMLLM
demonstrated advancements in translation performance for two low-resource
language pairs: English$\leftrightarrow$Irish and
English$\leftrightarrow$Marathi, compared to baselines from the LoResMT2021
Shared Task.

##### **Artificial Intelligence and Diabetes Mellitus: An Inside Look Through the Retina**
2402.18600v1 by Yasin Sadeghi Bazargani,Majid Mirzaei,Navid Sobhi,Mirsaeed Abdollahi,Ali Jafarizadeh,Siamak Pedrammehr,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Ru San Tan,Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam,U. Rajendra Acharya

Diabetes mellitus (DM) predisposes patients to vascular complications.
Retinal images and vasculature reflect the body's micro- and macrovascular
health. They can be used to diagnose DM complications, including diabetic
retinopathy (DR), neuropathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease, as well as forecast the risk of cardiovascular events. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-enabled systems developed for high-throughput detection of DR
using digitized retinal images have become clinically adopted. Beyond DR
screening, AI integration also holds immense potential to address challenges
associated with the holistic care of the patient with DM. In this work, we aim
to comprehensively review the literature for studies on AI applications based
on retinal images related to DM diagnosis, prognostication, and management. We
will describe the findings of holistic AI-assisted diabetes care, including but
not limited to DR screening, and discuss barriers to implementing such systems,
including issues concerning ethics, data privacy, equitable access, and
explainability. With the ability to evaluate the patient's health status vis a
vis DM complication as well as risk prognostication of future cardiovascular
complications, AI-assisted retinal image analysis has the potential to become a
central tool for modern personalized medicine in patients with DM.

##### **Multi-stakeholder Perspective on Responsible Artificial Intelligence and Acceptability in Education**
2402.15027v2 by A. J. Karran,P. Charland,J-T. Martineau,A. Ortiz de Guinea Lopez de Arana,AM. Lesage,S. Senecal,P-M. Leger

This study investigates the acceptability of different artificial
intelligence (AI) applications in education from a multi-stakeholder
perspective, including students, teachers, and parents. Acknowledging the
transformative potential of AI in education, it addresses concerns related to
data privacy, AI agency, transparency, explainability and the ethical
deployment of AI. Through a vignette methodology, participants were presented
with four scenarios where AI's agency, transparency, explainability, and
privacy were manipulated. After each scenario, participants completed a survey
that captured their perceptions of AI's global utility, individual usefulness,
justice, confidence, risk, and intention to use each scenario's AI if
available. The data collection comprising a final sample of 1198
multi-stakeholder participants was distributed through a partner institution
and social media campaigns and focused on individual responses to four AI use
cases. A mediation analysis of the data indicated that acceptance and trust in
AI varies significantly across stakeholder groups. We found that the key
mediators between high and low levels of AI's agency, transparency, and
explainability, as well as the intention to use the different educational AI,
included perceived global utility, justice, and confidence. The study
highlights that the acceptance of AI in education is a nuanced and multifaceted
issue that requires careful consideration of specific AI applications and their
characteristics, in addition to the diverse stakeholders' perceptions.

##### **Deciphering Heartbeat Signatures: A Vision Transformer Approach to Explainable Atrial Fibrillation Detection from ECG Signals**
2402.09474v2 by Aruna Mohan,Danne Elbers,Or Zilbershot,Fatemeh Afghah,David Vorchheimer

Remote patient monitoring based on wearable single-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG) devices has significant potential for enabling the early detection of
heart disease, especially in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)
approaches for automated heart disease detection. There have been prior studies
applying AI approaches based on deep learning for heart disease detection.
However, these models are yet to be widely accepted as a reliable aid for
clinical diagnostics, in part due to the current black-box perception
surrounding many AI algorithms. In particular, there is a need to identify the
key features of the ECG signal that contribute toward making an accurate
diagnosis, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. In the present
study, we develop a vision transformer approach to identify atrial fibrillation
based on single-lead ECG data. A residual network (ResNet) approach is also
developed for comparison with the vision transformer approach. These models are
applied to the Chapman-Shaoxing dataset to classify atrial fibrillation, as
well as another common arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and normal sinus rhythm
heartbeats. The models enable the identification of the key regions of the
heartbeat that determine the resulting classification, and highlight the
importance of P-waves and T-waves, as well as heartbeat duration and signal
amplitude, in distinguishing normal sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and
sinus bradycardia.

##### **Illuminate: A novel approach for depression detection with explainable analysis and proactive therapy using prompt engineering**
2402.05127v1 by Aryan Agrawal

This paper introduces a novel paradigm for depression detection and treatment
using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer
4 (GPT-4), Llama 2 chat, and Gemini. These LLMs are fine-tuned with specialized
prompts to diagnose, explain, and suggest therapeutic interventions for
depression. A unique few-shot prompting method enhances the models' ability to
analyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM-5 criteria. In the
interaction phase, the models engage in empathetic dialogue management, drawing
from resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide,
fostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major
depressive disorders. Additionally, the research introduces the Illuminate
Database, enriched with various CBT modules, aiding in personalized therapy
recommendations. The study evaluates LLM performance using metrics such as F1
scores, Precision, Recall, Cosine similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy
for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) across different test sets, demonstrating their
effectiveness. This comprehensive approach blends cutting-edge AI with
established psychological methods, offering new possibilities in mental health
care and showcasing the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing depression
diagnosis and treatment strategies.

##### **Information That Matters: Exploring Information Needs of People Affected by Algorithmic Decisions**
2401.13324v4 by Timothée Schmude,Laura Koesten,Torsten Möller,Sebastian Tschiatschek

Explanations of AI systems rarely address the information needs of people
affected by algorithmic decision-making (ADM). This gap between conveyed
information and information that matters to affected stakeholders can impede
understanding and adherence to regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. To
address this gap, we present the "XAI Novice Question Bank": A catalog of
affected stakeholders' information needs in two ADM use cases (employment
prediction and health monitoring), covering the categories data, system
context, system usage, and system specifications. Information needs were
gathered in an interview study where participants received explanations in
response to their inquiries. Participants further reported their understanding
and decision confidence, showing that while confidence tended to increase after
receiving explanations, participants also met understanding challenges, such as
being unable to tell why their understanding felt incomplete. Explanations
further influenced participants' perceptions of the systems' risks and
benefits, which they confirmed or changed depending on the use case. When risks
were perceived as high, participants expressed particular interest in
explanations about intention, such as why and to what end a system was put in
place. With this work, we aim to support the inclusion of affected stakeholders
into explainability by contributing an overview of information and challenges
relevant to them when deciding on the adoption of ADM systems. We close by
summarizing our findings in a list of six key implications that inform the
design of future explanations for affected stakeholder audiences.

##### **Evaluating Large Language Models on the GMAT: Implications for the Future of Business Education**
2401.02985v1 by Vahid Ashrafimoghari,Necdet Gürkan,Jordan W. Suchow

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the domain
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, has opened new avenues for
application across various fields, yet its role in business education remains
underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the
performance of seven major LLMs, OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and
GPT-4 Turbo), Google's models (PaLM 2, Gemini 1.0 Pro), and Anthropic's models
(Claude 2 and Claude 2.1), on the GMAT, which is a key exam in the admission
process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs
outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other
models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top
business schools. Through a case study, this research examines GPT-4 Turbo's
ability to explain answers, evaluate responses, identify errors, tailor
instructions, and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions,
GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, and Gemini 1.0 Pro, show marked improvements in
reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors, underscoring their potential
for complex problem-solving. While AI's promise in education, assessment, and
tutoring is clear, challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs'
academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and
application of AI in education. As AI technology advances, it is imperative to
establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction, verify the accuracy of
AI-generated content, ensure worldwide access for diverse learners, and create
an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research
sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich
educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.

##### **XAI for In-hospital Mortality Prediction via Multimodal ICU Data**
2312.17624v1 by Xingqiao Li,Jindong Gu,Zhiyong Wang,Yancheng Yuan,Bo Du,Fengxiang He

Predicting in-hospital mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is
key to final clinical outcomes. AI has shown advantaged accuracy but suffers
from the lack of explainability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an
eXplainable Multimodal Mortality Predictor (X-MMP) approaching an efficient,
explainable AI solution for predicting in-hospital mortality via multimodal ICU
data. We employ multimodal learning in our framework, which can receive
heterogeneous inputs from clinical data and make decisions. Furthermore, we
introduce an explainable method, namely Layer-Wise Propagation to Transformer,
as a proper extension of the LRP method to Transformers, producing explanations
over multimodal inputs and revealing the salient features attributed to
prediction. Moreover, the contribution of each modality to clinical outcomes
can be visualized, assisting clinicians in understanding the reasoning behind
decision-making. We construct a multimodal dataset based on MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve
reasonable interpretation with competitive prediction accuracy. In particular,
our framework can be easily transferred to other clinical tasks, which
facilitates the discovery of crucial factors in healthcare research.

##### **Joining Forces for Pathology Diagnostics with AI Assistance: The EMPAIA Initiative**
2401.09450v2 by Norman Zerbe,Lars Ole Schwen,Christian Geißler,Katja Wiesemann,Tom Bisson,Peter Boor,Rita Carvalho,Michael Franz,Christoph Jansen,Tim-Rasmus Kiehl,Björn Lindequist,Nora Charlotte Pohlan,Sarah Schmell,Klaus Strohmenger,Falk Zakrzewski,Markus Plass,Michael Takla,Tobias Küster,André Homeyer,Peter Hufnagl

Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) methods in pathology have
advanced substantially. However, integration into routine clinical practice has
been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory
hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and
the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA
initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's
achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the
pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry.
In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards,
recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability
methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and
successfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different
vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized
interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real
clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia.
In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders
to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial,
clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source
interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and
streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and
broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a
sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International,
has been established to continue standardization and support broad
implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.

##### **Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual Explanations**
2312.11747v2 by Mario Alfonso Prado-Romero,Bardh Prenkaj,Giovanni Stilo

Counterfactual Explanation (CE) techniques have garnered attention as a means
to provide insights to the users engaging with AI systems. While extensively
researched in domains such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicles, Graph
Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) methods have been comparatively
under-explored. GCEs generate a new graph similar to the original one, with a
different outcome grounded on the underlying predictive model. Among these GCE
techniques, those rooted in generative mechanisms have received relatively
limited investigation despite demonstrating impressive accomplishments in other
domains, such as artistic styles and natural language modelling. The preference
for generative explainers stems from their capacity to generate counterfactual
instances during inference, leveraging autonomously acquired perturbations of
the input graph. Motivated by the rationales above, our study introduces
RSGG-CE, a novel Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual
Explanations able to produce counterfactual examples from the learned latent
space considering a partially ordered generation sequence. Furthermore, we
undertake quantitative and qualitative analyses to compare RSGG-CE's
performance against SoA generative explainers, highlighting its increased
ability to engendering plausible counterfactual candidates.

##### **Evaluating the Utility of Model Explanations for Model Development**
2312.06032v1 by Shawn Im,Jacob Andreas,Yilun Zhou

One of the motivations for explainable AI is to allow humans to make better
and more informed decisions regarding the use and deployment of AI models. But
careful evaluations are needed to assess whether this expectation has been
fulfilled. Current evaluations mainly focus on algorithmic properties of
explanations, and those that involve human subjects often employ subjective
questions to test human's perception of explanation usefulness, without being
grounded in objective metrics and measurements. In this work, we evaluate
whether explanations can improve human decision-making in practical scenarios
of machine learning model development. We conduct a mixed-methods user study
involving image data to evaluate saliency maps generated by SmoothGrad,
GradCAM, and an oracle explanation on two tasks: model selection and
counterfactual simulation. To our surprise, we did not find evidence of
significant improvement on these tasks when users were provided with any of the
saliency maps, even the synthetic oracle explanation designed to be simple to
understand and highly indicative of the answer. Nonetheless, explanations did
help users more accurately describe the models. These findings suggest caution
regarding the usefulness and potential for misunderstanding in saliency-based
explanations.

##### **Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety**
2312.06798v1 by Manas Gaur,Amit Sheth

Explainability and Safety engender Trust. These require a model to exhibit
consistency and reliability. To achieve these, it is necessary to use and
analyze data and knowledge with statistical and symbolic AI methods relevant to
the AI application - neither alone will do. Consequently, we argue and seek to
demonstrate that the NeuroSymbolic AI approach is better suited for making AI a
trusted AI system. We present the CREST framework that shows how Consistency,
Reliability, user-level Explainability, and Safety are built on NeuroSymbolic
methods that use data and knowledge to support requirements for critical
applications such as health and well-being. This article focuses on Large
Language Models (LLMs) as the chosen AI system within the CREST framework. LLMs
have garnered substantial attention from researchers due to their versatility
in handling a broad array of natural language processing (NLP) scenarios. For
example, ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM have emerged as highly promising
platforms for providing information in general and health-related queries,
respectively. Nevertheless, these models remain black boxes despite
incorporating human feedback and instruction-guided tuning. For instance,
ChatGPT can generate unsafe responses despite instituting safety guardrails.
CREST presents a plausible approach harnessing procedural and graph-based
knowledge within a NeuroSymbolic framework to shed light on the challenges
associated with LLMs.

##### **Deployment of a Robust and Explainable Mortality Prediction Model: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond**
2311.17133v1 by Jacob R. Epifano,Stephen Glass,Ravi P. Ramachandran,Sharad Patel,Aaron J. Masino,Ghulam Rasool

This study investigated the performance, explainability, and robustness of
deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models in predicting mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The first study of its kind, we found that
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and intelligent training techniques allowed our
models to maintain performance amidst significant data shifts. Our results
emphasize the importance of developing robust AI models capable of matching or
surpassing clinician predictions, even under challenging conditions. Our
exploration of model explainability revealed that stochastic models generate
more diverse and personalized explanations thereby highlighting the need for AI
models that provide detailed and individualized insights in real-world clinical
settings. Furthermore, we underscored the importance of quantifying uncertainty
in AI models which enables clinicians to make better-informed decisions based
on reliable predictions. Our study advocates for prioritizing implementation
science in AI research for healthcare and ensuring that AI solutions are
practical, beneficial, and sustainable in real-world clinical environments. By
addressing unique challenges and complexities in healthcare settings,
researchers can develop AI models that effectively improve clinical practice
and patient outcomes.

##### **Variational Autoencoders for Feature Exploration and Malignancy Prediction of Lung Lesions**
2311.15719v1 by Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Samuel D. Relton

Lung cancer is responsible for 21% of cancer deaths in the UK and five-year
survival rates are heavily influenced by the stage the cancer was identified
at. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of AI methods for accurate
and early diagnosis of lung cancer from routine scans. However, this evidence
has not translated into clinical practice with one barrier being a lack of
interpretable models. This study investigates the application Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions.
Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the
LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced
by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used
in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved
state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows
the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions
based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient
and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard
Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces
the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent
space with disentangled feature representation. Finally, we demonstrate the
potential for latent space traversals corresponding to clinically meaningful
feature changes.

##### **MRxaI: Black-Box Explainability for Image Classifiers in a Medical Setting**
2311.14471v1 by Nathan Blake,Hana Chockler,David A. Kelly,Santiago Calderon Pena,Akchunya Chanchal

Existing tools for explaining the output of image classifiers can be divided
into white-box, which rely on access to the model internals, and black-box,
agnostic to the model. As the usage of AI in the medical domain grows, so too
does the usage of explainability tools. Existing work on medical image
explanations focuses on white-box tools, such as gradcam. However, there are
clear advantages to switching to a black-box tool, including the ability to use
it with any classifier and the wide selection of black-box tools available. On
standard images, black-box tools are as precise as white-box. In this paper we
compare the performance of several black-box methods against gradcam on a brain
cancer MRI dataset. We demonstrate that most black-box tools are not suitable
for explaining medical image classifications and present a detailed analysis of
the reasons for their shortcomings. We also show that one black-box tool, a
causal explainability-based rex, performs as well as \gradcam.

##### **Moderating Model Marketplaces: Platform Governance Puzzles for AI Intermediaries**
2311.12573v2 by Robert Gorwa,Michael Veale

The AI development community is increasingly making use of hosting
intermediaries such as Hugging Face provide easy access to user-uploaded models
and training data. These model marketplaces lower technical deployment barriers
for hundreds of thousands of users, yet can be used in numerous potentially
harmful and illegal ways. In this article, we explain ways in which AI systems,
which can both `contain' content and be open-ended tools, present one of the
trickiest platform governance challenges seen to date. We provide case studies
of several incidents across three illustrative platforms -- Hugging Face,
GitHub and Civitai -- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models.
Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited)
practices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands:
licensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open
policy development. While the policy challenge at hand is a considerable one,
we conclude with some ideas as to how platforms could better mobilize resources
to act as a careful, fair, and proportionate regulatory access point.

##### **Ovarian Cancer Data Analysis using Deep Learning: A Systematic Review from the Perspectives of Key Features of Data Analysis and AI Assurance**
2311.11932v1 by Muta Tah Hira,Mohammad A. Razzaque,Mosharraf Sarker

Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep
Learning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and
cancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data
sets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been
published. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer
(e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features.
However, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these
features and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review
aims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying
important aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key
features and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used
to conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies
published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the
analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were
examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven
ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on
detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention
of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse
population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country.
- Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated
analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a
mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and
diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and -
The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only
2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability.

##### **Representing visual classification as a linear combination of words**
2311.10933v1 by Shobhit Agarwal,Yevgeniy R. Semenov,William Lotter

Explainability is a longstanding challenge in deep learning, especially in
high-stakes domains like healthcare. Common explainability methods highlight
image regions that drive an AI model's decision. Humans, however, heavily rely
on language to convey explanations of not only "where" but "what".
Additionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI
predictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in
general. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing,
and potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in
novel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a
vision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual
classification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between
images and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear
combination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its
alignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two
medical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting
descriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of
domain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the
potential for 'shortcut connections' in the public datasets used. Towards a
functional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we
find that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a
specialized medical task at a non-trivial level. Altogether, our results
emphasize the potential of using multimodal foundational models to deliver
intuitive, language-based explanations of visual tasks.

##### **Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in medical imaging AI**
2311.02115v1 by Emma A. M. Stanley,Raissa Souza,Anthony Winder,Vedant Gulve,Kimberly Amador,Matthias Wilms,Nils D. Forkert

Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical
tasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between
subgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data
are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those
biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at
ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel
analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact
of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this
framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical
imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with
known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by
using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated
bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the
efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the
simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the
CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified
as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we
demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the
manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI
models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of
biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a
novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation
strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of
clinical AI that is robust and responsible.

##### **Predicting recovery following stroke: deep learning, multimodal data and feature selection using explainable AI**
2310.19174v1 by Adam White,Margarita Saranti,Artur d'Avila Garcez,Thomas M. H. Hope,Cathy J. Price,Howard Bowman

Machine learning offers great potential for automated prediction of
post-stroke symptoms and their response to rehabilitation. Major challenges for
this endeavour include the very high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, the
relatively small size of the datasets available for learning, and how to
effectively combine neuroimaging and tabular data (e.g. demographic information
and clinical characteristics). This paper evaluates several solutions based on
two strategies. The first is to use 2D images that summarise MRI scans. The
second is to select key features that improve classification accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce the novel approach of training a convolutional
neural network (CNN) on images that combine regions-of-interest extracted from
MRIs, with symbolic representations of tabular data. We evaluate a series of
CNN architectures (both 2D and a 3D) that are trained on different
representations of MRI and tabular data, to predict whether a composite measure
of post-stroke spoken picture description ability is in the aphasic or
non-aphasic range. MRI and tabular data were acquired from 758 English speaking
stroke survivors who participated in the PLORAS study. The classification
accuracy for a baseline logistic regression was 0.678 for lesion size alone,
rising to 0.757 and 0.813 when initial symptom severity and recovery time were
successively added. The highest classification accuracy 0.854 was observed when
8 regions-of-interest was extracted from each MRI scan and combined with lesion
size, initial severity and recovery time in a 2D Residual Neural Network.Our
findings demonstrate how imaging and tabular data can be combined for high
post-stroke classification accuracy, even when the dataset is small in machine
learning terms. We conclude by proposing how the current models could be
improved to achieve even higher levels of accuracy using images from hospital
scanners.

##### **Trainable Noise Model as an XAI evaluation method: application on Sobol for remote sensing image segmentation**
2310.01828v2 by Hossein Shreim,Abdul Karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as an essential
requirement when dealing with mission-critical applications, ensuring
transparency and interpretability of the employed black box AI models. The
significance of XAI spans various domains, from healthcare to finance, where
understanding the decision-making process of deep learning algorithms is
essential. Most AI-based computer vision models are often black boxes; hence,
providing explainability of deep neural networks in image processing is crucial
for their wide adoption and deployment in medical image analysis, autonomous
driving, and remote sensing applications. Recently, several XAI methods for
image classification tasks have been introduced. On the contrary, image
segmentation has received comparatively less attention in the context of
explainability, although it is a fundamental task in computer vision
applications, especially in remote sensing. Only some research proposes
gradient-based XAI algorithms for image segmentation. This paper adapts the
recent gradient-free Sobol XAI method for semantic segmentation. To measure the
performance of the Sobol method for segmentation, we propose a quantitative XAI
evaluation method based on a learnable noise model. The main objective of this
model is to induce noise on the explanation maps, where higher induced noise
signifies low accuracy and vice versa. A benchmark analysis is conducted to
evaluate and compare performance of three XAI methods, including Seg-Grad-CAM,
Seg-Grad-CAM++ and Seg-Sobol using the proposed noise-based evaluation
technique. This constitutes the first attempt to run and evaluate XAI methods
using high-resolution satellite images.

##### **Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI**
2311.01463v1 by Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad,Ilker Yaramis,Taposh Dutta Roy

Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short
period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare
domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and
hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers
have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key
to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these
models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this
paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and
unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare.
Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of
hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future
of LLMs in healthcare may look like.

##### **When to Trust AI: Advances and Challenges for Certification of Neural Networks**
2309.11196v1 by Marta Kwiatkowska,Xiyue Zhang

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been advancing at a fast pace and it is now
poised for deployment in a wide range of applications, such as autonomous
systems, medical diagnosis and natural language processing. Early adoption of
AI technology for real-world applications has not been without problems,
particularly for neural networks, which may be unstable and susceptible to
adversarial examples. In the longer term, appropriate safety assurance
techniques need to be developed to reduce potential harm due to avoidable
system failures and ensure trustworthiness. Focusing on certification and
explainability, this paper provides an overview of techniques that have been
developed to ensure safety of AI decisions and discusses future challenges.

##### **Functional requirements to mitigate the Risk of Harm to Patients from Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**
2309.10424v1 by Juan M. García-Gómez,Vicent Blanes-Selva,José Carlos de Bartolomé Cenzano,Jaime Cebolla-Cornejo,Ascensión Doñate-Martínez

The Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services of the European
Parliament has prepared a report to the Members of the European Parliament
where they enumerate seven main risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
medicine and healthcare: patient harm due to AI errors, misuse of medical AI
tools, bias in AI and the perpetuation of existing inequities, lack of
transparency, privacy and security issues, gaps in accountability, and
obstacles in implementation.
  In this study, we propose fourteen functional requirements that AI systems
may implement to reduce the risks associated with their medical purpose: AI
passport, User management, Regulation check, Academic use only disclaimer, data
quality assessment, Clinicians double check, Continuous performance evaluation,
Audit trail, Continuous usability test, Review of retrospective/simulated
cases, Bias check, eXplainable AI, Encryption and use of field-tested
libraries, and Semantic interoperability.
  Our intention here is to provide specific high-level specifications of
technical solutions to ensure continuous good performance and use of AI systems
to benefit patients in compliance with the future EU regulatory framework.

##### **QXAI: Explainable AI Framework for Quantitative Analysis in Patient Monitoring Systems**
2309.10293v3 by Thanveer Shaik,Xiaohui Tao,Haoran Xie,Lin Li,Juan D. Velasquez,Niall Higgins

Artificial Intelligence techniques can be used to classify a patient's
physical activities and predict vital signs for remote patient monitoring.
Regression analysis based on non-linear models like deep learning models has
limited explainability due to its black-box nature. This can require
decision-makers to make blind leaps of faith based on non-linear model results,
especially in healthcare applications. In non-invasive monitoring, patient data
from tracking sensors and their predisposing clinical attributes act as input
features for predicting future vital signs. Explaining the contributions of
various features to the overall output of the monitoring application is
critical for a clinician's decision-making. In this study, an Explainable AI
for Quantitative analysis (QXAI) framework is proposed with post-hoc model
explainability and intrinsic explainability for regression and classification
tasks in a supervised learning approach. This was achieved by utilizing the
Shapley values concept and incorporating attention mechanisms in deep learning
models. We adopted the artificial neural networks (ANN) and attention-based
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models for the prediction of heart rate and
classification of physical activities based on sensor data. The deep learning
models achieved state-of-the-art results in both prediction and classification
tasks. Global explanation and local explanation were conducted on input data to
understand the feature contribution of various patient data. The proposed QXAI
framework was evaluated using PPG-DaLiA data to predict heart rate and mobile
health (MHEALTH) data to classify physical activities based on sensor data.
Monte Carlo approximation was applied to the framework to overcome the time
complexity and high computation power requirements required for Shapley value
calculations.

##### **Evaluation of Human-Understandability of Global Model Explanations using Decision Tree**
2309.09917v1 by Adarsa Sivaprasad,Ehud Reiter,Nava Tintarev,Nir Oren

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research, the predominant focus
has been on interpreting models for experts and practitioners. Model agnostic
and local explanation approaches are deemed interpretable and sufficient in
many applications. However, in domains like healthcare, where end users are
patients without AI or domain expertise, there is an urgent need for model
explanations that are more comprehensible and instil trust in the model's
operations. We hypothesise that generating model explanations that are
narrative, patient-specific and global(holistic of the model) would enable
better understandability and enable decision-making. We test this using a
decision tree model to generate both local and global explanations for patients
identified as having a high risk of coronary heart disease. These explanations
are presented to non-expert users. We find a strong individual preference for a
specific type of explanation. The majority of participants prefer global
explanations, while a smaller group prefers local explanations. A task based
evaluation of mental models of these participants provide valuable feedback to
enhance narrative global explanations. This, in turn, guides the design of
health informatics systems that are both trustworthy and actionable.

##### **An explainable three dimension framework to uncover learning patterns: A unified look in variable sulci recognition**
2309.00903v2 by Michail Mamalakis,Heloise de Vareilles,Atheer AI-Manea,Samantha C. Mitchell,Ingrid Arartz,Lynn Egeland Morch-Johnsen,Jane Garrison,Jon Simons,Pietro Lio,John Suckling,Graham Murray

Explainable AI is crucial in medical imaging. In the challenging field of
neuroscience, visual topics present a high level of complexity, particularly
within three-dimensional space. The application of neuroscience, which involves
identifying brain sulcal features from MRI, faces significant hurdles due to
varying annotation protocols among experts and the intricate three-dimension
functionality of the brain. Consequently, traditional explainability approaches
fall short in effectively validating and evaluating these networks. To address
this, we first present a mathematical formulation delineating various
categories of explanation needs across diverse computer vision tasks,
categorized into self-explanatory, semi-explanatory, non-explanatory, and
new-pattern learning applications based on the reliability of the validation
protocol. With respect to this mathematical formulation, we propose a 3D
explainability framework aimed at validating the outputs of deep learning
networks in detecting the paracingulate sulcus an essential brain anatomical
feature. The framework integrates local 3D explanations, global explanations
through dimensionality reduction, concatenated global explanations, and
statistical shape features, unveiling new insights into pattern learning. We
trained and tested two advanced 3D deep learning networks on the challenging
TOP-OSLO dataset, significantly improving sulcus detection accuracy,
particularly on the left hemisphere. During evaluation with diverse annotation
protocols for this dataset, we highlighted the crucial role of an unbiased
annotation process in achieving precise predictions and effective pattern
learning within our proposed 3D framework. The proposed framework not only
annotates the variable sulcus but also uncovers hidden AI knowledge, promising
to advance our understanding of brain anatomy and function.

##### **Leveraging A Medical Knowledge Graph into Large Language Models for Diagnosis Prediction**
2308.14321v1 by Yanjun Gao,Ruizhe Li,John Caskey,Dmitriy Dligach,Timothy Miller,Matthew M. Churpek,Majid Afshar

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and routine documentation practices play a
vital role in patients' daily care, providing a holistic record of health,
diagnoses, and treatment. However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload
healthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their
application in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of
diagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline
an innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of
automated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical
knowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: Dr.Knows, inspired by the
clinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National
Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust
repository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for
pre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in
the interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using
real-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the
accuracy of automated diagnosis generation. More importantly, our approach
offers an explainable diagnostic pathway, edging us closer to the realization
of AI-augmented diagnostic decision support systems.

##### **Deciphering knee osteoarthritis diagnostic features with explainable artificial intelligence: A systematic review**
2308.09380v1 by Yun Xin Teoh,Alice Othmani,Siew Li Goh,Juliana Usman,Khin Wee Lai

Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnosing knee
osteoarthritis (OA) have faced criticism for their lack of transparency and
interpretability, despite achieving medical-expert-like performance. This
opacity makes them challenging to trust in clinical practice. Recently,
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a specialized
technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by revealing
how the prediction is derived, thus promoting the use of AI systems in
healthcare. This paper presents the first survey of XAI techniques used for
knee OA diagnosis. The XAI techniques are discussed from two perspectives: data
interpretability and model interpretability. The aim of this paper is to
provide valuable insights into XAI's potential towards a more reliable knee OA
diagnosis approach and encourage its adoption in clinical practice.

##### **Explainable AI for clinical risk prediction: a survey of concepts, methods, and modalities**
2308.08407v1 by Munib Mesinovic,Peter Watkinson,Tingting Zhu

Recent advancements in AI applications to healthcare have shown incredible
promise in surpassing human performance in diagnosis and disease prognosis.
With the increasing complexity of AI models, however, concerns regarding their
opacity, potential biases, and the need for interpretability. To ensure trust
and reliability in AI systems, especially in clinical risk prediction models,
explainability becomes crucial. Explainability is usually referred to as an AI
system's ability to provide a robust interpretation of its decision-making
logic or the decisions themselves to human stakeholders. In clinical risk
prediction, other aspects of explainability like fairness, bias, trust, and
transparency also represent important concepts beyond just interpretability. In
this review, we address the relationship between these concepts as they are
often used together or interchangeably. This review also discusses recent
progress in developing explainable models for clinical risk prediction,
highlighting the importance of quantitative and clinical evaluation and
validation across multiple common modalities in clinical practice. It
emphasizes the need for external validation and the combination of diverse
interpretability methods to enhance trust and fairness. Adopting rigorous
testing, such as using synthetic datasets with known generative factors, can
further improve the reliability of explainability methods. Open access and
code-sharing resources are essential for transparency and reproducibility,
enabling the growth and trustworthiness of explainable research. While
challenges exist, an end-to-end approach to explainability in clinical risk
prediction, incorporating stakeholders from clinicians to developers, is
essential for success.

Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for medicine and
healthcare, the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in
real-world clinical practice. In recent years, concerns have been raised about
the technical, clinical, ethical and legal risks associated with medical AI. To
increase real world adoption, it is essential that medical AI tools are trusted
and accepted by patients, clinicians, health organisations and authorities.
This work describes the FUTURE-AI guideline as the first international
consensus framework for guiding the development and deployment of trustworthy
AI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI consortium was founded in 2021 and
currently comprises 118 inter-disciplinary experts from 51 countries
representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinicians, ethicists,
and social scientists. Over a two-year period, the consortium defined guiding
principles and best practices for trustworthy AI through an iterative process
comprising an in-depth literature review, a modified Delphi survey, and online
consensus meetings. The FUTURE-AI framework was established based on 6 guiding
principles for trustworthy AI in healthcare, i.e. Fairness, Universality,
Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Through consensus, a
set of 28 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, legal
and socio-ethical dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of
medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment,
and monitoring. FUTURE-AI is a risk-informed, assumption-free guideline which
provides a structured approach for constructing medical AI tools that will be
trusted, deployed and adopted in real-world practice. Researchers are
encouraged to take the recommendations into account in proof-of-concept stages
to facilitate future translation towards clinical practice of medical AI.

##### **Explainable AI applications in the Medical Domain: a systematic review**
2308.05411v1 by Nicoletta Prentzas,Antonis Kakas,Constantinos S. Pattichis

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine has made significant progress with
emerging applications in medical imaging, patient care, and other areas. While
these applications have proven successful in retrospective studies, very few of
them were applied in practice.The field of Medical AI faces various challenges,
in terms of building user trust, complying with regulations, using data
ethically.Explainable AI (XAI) aims to enable humans understand AI and trust
its results. This paper presents a literature review on the recent developments
of XAI solutions for medical decision support, based on a representative sample
of 198 articles published in recent years. The systematic synthesis of the
relevant articles resulted in several findings. (1) model-agnostic XAI
techniques were mostly employed in these solutions, (2) deep learning models
are utilized more than other types of machine learning models, (3)
explainability was applied to promote trust, but very few works reported the
physicians participation in the loop, (4) visual and interactive user interface
is more useful in understanding the explanation and the recommendation of the
system. More research is needed in collaboration between medical and AI
experts, that could guide the development of suitable frameworks for the
design, implementation, and evaluation of XAI solutions in medicine.

##### **Exploring the Role of Explainability in AI-Assisted Embryo Selection**
2308.02534v1 by Lucia Urcelay,Daniel Hinjos,Pablo A. Martin-Torres,Marta Gonzalez,Marta Mendez,Salva Cívico,Sergio Álvarez-Napagao,Dario Garcia-Gasulla

In Vitro Fertilization is among the most widespread treatments for
infertility. One of its main challenges is the evaluation and selection of
embryo for implantation, a process with large inter- and intra-clinician
variability. Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their
opaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where
transparency in the decision making is key. In this paper we analyze the
current work in the explainability of AI-assisted embryo analysis models,
identifying the limitations. We also discuss how these models could be
integrated in the clinical context as decision support systems, considering the
needs of clinicians and patients. Finally, we propose guidelines for the sake
of increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, pushing this technology
forward towards established clinical practice.

##### **A New Perspective on Evaluation Methods for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**
2307.14246v1 by Timo Speith,Markus Langer

Within the field of Requirements Engineering (RE), the increasing
significance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in aligning
AI-supported systems with user needs, societal expectations, and regulatory
standards has garnered recognition. In general, explainability has emerged as
an important non-functional requirement that impacts system quality. However,
the supposed trade-off between explainability and performance challenges the
presumed positive influence of explainability. If meeting the requirement of
explainability entails a reduction in system performance, then careful
consideration must be given to which of these quality aspects takes precedence
and how to compromise between them. In this paper, we critically examine the
alleged trade-off. We argue that it is best approached in a nuanced way that
incorporates resource availability, domain characteristics, and considerations
of risk. By providing a foundation for future research and best practices, this
work aims to advance the field of RE for AI.

##### **Acceptable risks in Europe's proposed AI Act: Reasonableness and other principles for deciding how much risk management is enough**
2308.02047v1 by Henry Fraser,Jose-Miguel Bello y Villarino

This paper critically evaluates the European Commission's proposed AI Act's
approach to risk management and risk acceptability for high-risk AI systems
that pose risks to fundamental rights and safety. The Act aims to promote
"trustworthy" AI with a proportionate regulatory burden. Its provisions on risk
acceptability require residual risks from high-risk systems to be reduced or
eliminated "as far as possible", having regard to the "state of the art". This
criterion, especially if interpreted narrowly, is unworkable and promotes
neither proportionate regulatory burden, nor trustworthiness. By contrast the
Parliament's most recent draft amendments to the risk management provisions
introduce "reasonableness", cost-benefit analysis, and are more transparent
about the value-laden and contextual nature of risk acceptability judgements.
This paper argues that the Parliament's approach is more workable, and better
balances the goals of proportionality and trustworthiness. It explains what
reasonableness in risk acceptability judgments would entail, drawing on
principles from negligence law and European medical devices regulation. And it
contends that the approach to risk acceptability judgments need a firm
foundation of civic legitimacy: including detailed guidance or involvement from
regulators, and meaningful input from affected stakeholders.

##### **eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in aging clock models**
2307.13704v3 by Alena Kalyakulina,Igor Yusipov,Alexey Moskalev,Claudio Franceschi,Mikhail Ivanchenko

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a rapidly progressing field of
machine learning, aiming to unravel the predictions of complex models. XAI is
especially required in sensitive applications, e.g. in health care, when
diagnosis, recommendations and treatment choices might rely on the decisions
made by artificial intelligence systems. AI approaches have become widely used
in aging research as well, in particular, in developing biological clock models
and identifying biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases. However, the
potential of XAI here awaits to be fully appreciated. We discuss the
application of XAI for developing the "aging clocks" and present a
comprehensive analysis of the literature categorized by the focus on particular
physiological systems.

##### **Interpreting and Correcting Medical Image Classification with PIP-Net**
2307.10404v2 by Meike Nauta,Johannes H. Hegeman,Jeroen Geerdink,Jörg Schlötterer,Maurice van Keulen,Christin Seifert

Part-prototype models are explainable-by-design image classifiers, and a
promising alternative to black box AI. This paper explores the applicability
and potential of interpretable machine learning, in particular PIP-Net, for
automated diagnosis support on real-world medical imaging data. PIP-Net learns
human-understandable prototypical image parts and we evaluate its accuracy and
interpretability for fracture detection and skin cancer diagnosis. We find that
PIP-Net's decision making process is in line with medical classification
standards, while only provided with image-level class labels. Because of
PIP-Net's unsupervised pretraining of prototypes, data quality problems such as
undesired text in an X-ray or labelling errors can be easily identified.
Additionally, we are the first to show that humans can manually correct the
reasoning of PIP-Net by directly disabling undesired prototypes. We conclude
that part-prototype models are promising for medical applications due to their
interpretability and potential for advanced model debugging.

##### **Explaining and visualizing black-box models through counterfactual paths**
2307.07764v3 by Bastian Pfeifer,Mateusz Krzyzinski,Hubert Baniecki,Anna Saranti,Andreas Holzinger,Przemyslaw Biecek

Explainable AI (XAI) is an increasingly important area of machine learning
research, which aims to make black-box models transparent and interpretable. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach to XAI that uses the so-called
counterfactual paths generated by conditional permutations of features. The
algorithm measures feature importance by identifying sequential permutations of
features that most influence changes in model predictions. It is particularly
suitable for generating explanations based on counterfactual paths in knowledge
graphs incorporating domain knowledge. Counterfactual paths introduce an
additional graph dimension to current XAI methods in both explaining and
visualizing black-box models. Experiments with synthetic and medical data
demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach.

##### **Beyond Known Reality: Exploiting Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Research**
2307.02131v5 by Toygar Tanyel,Serkan Ayvaz,Bilgin Keserci

The field of explainability in artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a
growing number of studies and increasing scholarly interest. However, the lack
of human-friendly and individual interpretations in explaining the outcomes of
machine learning algorithms has significantly hindered the acceptance of these
methods by clinicians in their research and clinical practice. To address this
issue, our study uses counterfactual explanations to explore the applicability
of "what if?" scenarios in medical research. Our aim is to expand our
understanding of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features used for diagnosing
pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors beyond existing boundaries. In our case
study, the proposed concept provides a novel way to examine alternative
decision-making scenarios that offer personalized and context-specific
insights, enabling the validation of predictions and clarification of
variations under diverse circumstances. Additionally, we explore the potential
use of counterfactuals for data augmentation and evaluate their feasibility as
an alternative approach in our medical research case. The results demonstrate
the promising potential of using counterfactual explanations to enhance
acceptance of AI-driven methods in clinical research.

##### **AI and Non AI Assessments for Dementia**
2307.01210v1 by Mahboobeh Parsapoor,Hamed Ghodrati,Vincenzo Dentamaro,Christopher R. Madan,Ioulietta Lazarou,Spiros Nikolopoulos,Ioannis Kompatsiaris

Current progress in the artificial intelligence domain has led to the
development of various types of AI-powered dementia assessments, which can be
employed to identify patients at the early stage of dementia. It can
revolutionize the dementia care settings. It is essential that the medical
community be aware of various AI assessments and choose them considering their
degrees of validity, efficiency, practicality, reliability, and accuracy
concerning the early identification of patients with dementia (PwD). On the
other hand, AI developers should be informed about various non-AI assessments
as well as recently developed AI assessments. Thus, this paper, which can be
readable by both clinicians and AI engineers, fills the gap in the literature
in explaining the existing solutions for the recognition of dementia to
clinicians, as well as the techniques used and the most widespread dementia
datasets to AI engineers. It follows a review of papers on AI and non-AI
assessments for dementia to provide valuable information about various dementia
assessments for both the AI and medical communities. The discussion and
conclusion highlight the most prominent research directions and the maturity of
existing solutions.

##### **Active Globally Explainable Learning for Medical Images via Class Association Embedding and Cyclic Adversarial Generation**
2306.07306v1 by Ruitao Xie,Jingbang Chen,Limai Jiang,Rui Xiao,Yi Pan,Yunpeng Cai

Explainability poses a major challenge to artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques. Current studies on explainable AI (XAI) lack the efficiency of
extracting global knowledge about the learning task, thus suffer deficiencies
such as imprecise saliency, context-aware absence and vague meaning. In this
paper, we propose the class association embedding (CAE) approach to address
these issues. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture to embed sample
features and separate them into class-related and individual-related style
vectors simultaneously. Recombining the individual-style code of a given sample
with the class-style code of another leads to a synthetic sample with preserved
individual characters but changed class assignment, following a cyclic
adversarial learning strategy. Class association embedding distills the global
class-related features of all instances into a unified domain with well
separation between classes. The transition rules between different classes can
be then extracted and further employed to individual instances. We then propose
an active XAI framework which manipulates the class-style vector of a certain
sample along guided paths towards the counter-classes, resulting in a series of
counter-example synthetic samples with identical individual characters.
Comparing these counterfactual samples with the original ones provides a
global, intuitive illustration to the nature of the classification tasks. We
adopt the framework on medical image classification tasks, which show that more
precise saliency maps with powerful context-aware representation can be
achieved compared with existing methods. Moreover, the disease pathology can be
directly visualized via traversing the paths in the class-style space.

Providing high quality explanations for AI predictions based on machine
learning is a challenging and complex task. To work well it requires, among
other factors: selecting a proper level of generality/specificity of the
explanation; considering assumptions about the familiarity of the explanation
beneficiary with the AI task under consideration; referring to specific
elements that have contributed to the decision; making use of additional
knowledge (e.g. expert evidence) which might not be part of the prediction
process; and providing evidence supporting negative hypothesis. Finally, the
system needs to formulate the explanation in a clearly interpretable, and
possibly convincing, way. Given these considerations, ANTIDOTE fosters an
integrated vision of explainable AI, where low-level characteristics of the
deep learning process are combined with higher level schemes proper of the
human argumentation capacity. ANTIDOTE will exploit cross-disciplinary
competences in deep learning and argumentation to support a broader and
innovative view of explainable AI, where the need for high-quality explanations
for clinical cases deliberation is critical. As a first result of the project,
we publish the Antidote CasiMedicos dataset to facilitate research on
explainable AI in general, and argumentation in the medical domain in
particular.

##### **XInsight: Revealing Model Insights for GNNs with Flow-based Explanations**
2306.04791v1 by Eli Laird,Ayesh Madushanka,Elfi Kraka,Corey Clark

Progress in graph neural networks has grown rapidly in recent years, with
many new developments in drug discovery, medical diagnosis, and recommender
systems. While this progress is significant, many networks are `black boxes'
with little understanding of the `what' exactly the network is learning. Many
high-stakes applications, such as drug discovery, require human-intelligible
explanations from the models so that users can recognize errors and discover
new knowledge. Therefore, the development of explainable AI algorithms is
essential for us to reap the benefits of AI.
  We propose an explainability algorithm for GNNs called eXplainable Insight
(XInsight) that generates a distribution of model explanations using GFlowNets.
Since GFlowNets generate objects with probabilities proportional to a reward,
XInsight can generate a diverse set of explanations, compared to previous
methods that only learn the maximum reward sample. We demonstrate XInsight by
generating explanations for GNNs trained on two graph classification tasks:
classifying mutagenic compounds with the MUTAG dataset and classifying acyclic
graphs with a synthetic dataset that we have open-sourced. We show the utility
of XInsight's explanations by analyzing the generated compounds using QSAR
modeling, and we find that XInsight generates compounds that cluster by
lipophilicity, a known correlate of mutagenicity. Our results show that
XInsight generates a distribution of explanations that uncovers the underlying
relationships demonstrated by the model. They also highlight the importance of
generating a diverse set of explanations, as it enables us to discover hidden
relationships in the model and provides valuable guidance for further analysis.

##### **Explainable AI using expressive Boolean formulas**
2306.03976v1 by Gili Rosenberg,J. Kyle Brubaker,Martin J. A. Schuetz,Grant Salton,Zhihuai Zhu,Elton Yechao Zhu,Serdar Kadıoğlu,Sima E. Borujeni,Helmut G. Katzgraber

We propose and implement an interpretable machine learning classification
model for Explainable AI (XAI) based on expressive Boolean formulas. Potential
applications include credit scoring and diagnosis of medical conditions. The
Boolean formula defines a rule with tunable complexity (or interpretability),
according to which input data are classified. Such a formula can include any
operator that can be applied to one or more Boolean variables, thus providing
higher expressivity compared to more rigid rule-based and tree-based
approaches. The classifier is trained using native local optimization
techniques, efficiently searching the space of feasible formulas. Shallow rules
can be determined by fast Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers, potentially powered by
special purpose hardware or quantum devices. We combine the expressivity and
efficiency of the native local optimizer with the fast operation of these
devices by executing non-local moves that optimize over subtrees of the full
Boolean formula. We provide extensive numerical benchmarking results featuring
several baselines on well-known public datasets. Based on the results, we find
that the native local rule classifier is generally competitive with the other
classifiers. The addition of non-local moves achieves similar results with
fewer iterations, and therefore using specialized or quantum hardware could
lead to a speedup by fast proposal of non-local moves.

##### **Utterance Classification with Logical Neural Network: Explainable AI for Mental Disorder Diagnosis**
2306.03902v1 by Yeldar Toleubay,Don Joven Agravante,Daiki Kimura,Baihan Lin,Djallel Bouneffouf,Michiaki Tatsubori

In response to the global challenge of mental health problems, we proposes a
Logical Neural Network (LNN) based Neuro-Symbolic AI method for the diagnosis
of mental disorders. Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental
disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with
the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and
may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network
architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with
the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system
uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder
class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve
scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction
method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses
the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more
trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.

##### **A Novel real-time arrhythmia detection model using YOLOv8**
2305.16727v3 by Guang Jun Nicholas Ang,Aritejh Kr Goil,Henryk Chan,Jieyi Jeric Lew,Xin Chun Lee,Raihan Bin Ahmad Mustaffa,Timotius Jason,Ze Ting Woon,Bingquan Shen

In a landscape characterized by heightened connectivity and mobility, coupled
with a surge in cardiovascular ailments, the imperative to curtail healthcare
expenses through remote monitoring of cardiovascular health has become more
pronounced. The accurate detection and classification of cardiac arrhythmias
are pivotal for diagnosing individuals with heart irregularities. This study
underscores the feasibility of employing electrocardiograms (ECG) measurements
in the home environment for real-time arrhythmia detection. Presenting a fresh
application for arrhythmia detection, this paper leverages the cutting-edge
You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v8 algorithm to categorize single-lead ECG signals. We
introduce a novel loss-modified YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned on the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia dataset, enabling real-time continuous monitoring. The obtained
results substantiate the efficacy of our approach, with the model attaining an
average accuracy of 99.5% and 0.992 mAP@50, and a rapid detection time of 0.002
seconds on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. Our investigation exemplifies the potential of
real-time arrhythmia detection, enabling users to visually interpret the model
output within the comfort of their homes. Furthermore, this study lays the
groundwork for an extension into a real-time explainable AI (XAI) model capable
of deployment in the healthcare sector, thereby significantly advancing the
realm of healthcare solutions.

##### **Breast Cancer Segmentation using Attention-based Convolutional Network and Explainable AI**
2305.14389v2 by Jai Vardhan,Taraka Satya Krishna Teja Malisetti

Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant health threat, with no long-term
cure currently available. Early detection is crucial, yet mammography
interpretation is hindered by high false positives and negatives. With BC
incidence projected to surpass lung cancer, improving early detection methods
is vital. Thermography, using high-resolution infrared cameras, offers promise,
especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). This work presents
an attention-based convolutional neural network for segmentation, providing
increased speed and precision in BC detection and classification. The system
enhances images and performs cancer segmentation with explainable AI. We
propose a transformer-attention-based convolutional architecture (UNet) for
fault identification and employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM) to analyze areas of bias and weakness in the UNet architecture with
IRT images. The superiority of our proposed framework is confirmed when
compared with existing deep learning frameworks.

##### **What Symptoms and How Long? An Interpretable AI Approach for Depression Detection in Social Media**
2305.13127v2 by Junwei Kuang,Jiaheng Xie,Zhijun Yan

Depression is the most prevalent and serious mental illness, which induces
grave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for
early intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision
inherently necessitates interpretability. Although a few depression detection
studies attempt to explain the decision based on the importance score or
attention weights, these explanations misalign with the clinical depression
diagnosis criterion that is based on depressive symptoms. To fill this gap, we
follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel Multi-Scale
Temporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet innovatively detects and
interprets depressive symptoms as well as how long they last. Extensive
empirical analyses using a large-scale dataset show that MSTPNet outperforms
state-of-the-art depression detection methods with an F1-score of 0.851. This
result also reveals new symptoms that are unnoted in the survey approach, such
as sharing admiration for a different life. We further conduct a user study to
demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study
contributes to IS literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for
depression detection in social media. In practice, our proposed method can be
implemented in social media platforms to provide personalized online resources
for detected depressed patients.

##### **Echoes of Biases: How Stigmatizing Language Affects AI Performance**
2305.10201v4 by Yizhi Liu,Weiguang Wang,Guodong Gordon Gao,Ritu Agarwal

Electronic health records (EHRs) serve as an essential data source for the
envisioned artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation in healthcare.
However, clinician biases reflected in EHR notes can lead to AI models
inheriting and amplifying these biases, perpetuating health disparities. This
study investigates the impact of stigmatizing language (SL) in EHR notes on
mortality prediction using a Transformer-based deep learning model and
explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our findings demonstrate that SL written by
clinicians adversely affects AI performance, particularly so for black
patients, highlighting SL as a source of racial disparity in AI model
development. To explore an operationally efficient way to mitigate SL's impact,
we investigate patterns in the generation of SL through a clinicians'
collaborative network, identifying central clinicians as having a stronger
impact on racial disparity in the AI model. We find that removing SL written by
central clinicians is a more efficient bias reduction strategy than eliminating
all SL in the entire corpus of data. This study provides actionable insights
for responsible AI development and contributes to understanding clinician
behavior and EHR note writing in healthcare.

##### **Explaining the ghosts: Feminist intersectional XAI and cartography as methods to account for invisible labour**
2305.03376v1 by Goda Klumbyte,Hannah Piehl,Claude Draude

Contemporary automation through AI entails a substantial amount of
behind-the-scenes human labour, which is often both invisibilised and
underpaid. Since invisible labour, including labelling and maintenance work, is
an integral part of contemporary AI systems, it remains important to sensitise
users to its role. We suggest that this could be done through explainable AI
(XAI) design, particularly feminist intersectional XAI. We propose the method
of cartography, which stems from feminist intersectional research, to draw out
a systemic perspective of AI and include dimensions of AI that pertain to
invisible labour.

##### **Towards Explainable and Safe Conversational Agents for Mental Health: A Survey**
2304.13191v1 by Surjodeep Sarkar,Manas Gaur,L. Chen,Muskan Garg,Biplav Srivastava,Bhaktee Dongaonkar

Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) are seeing continual advancements to
support the overburdened global healthcare system that gets 60 million primary
care visits, and 6 million Emergency Room (ER) visits annually. These systems
are built by clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) researchers for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). At present, the role
of VMHAs is to provide emotional support through information, focusing less on
developing a reflective conversation with the patient. A more comprehensive,
safe and explainable approach is required to build responsible VMHAs to ask
follow-up questions or provide a well-informed response. This survey offers a
systematic critical review of the existing conversational agents in mental
health, followed by new insights into the improvements of VMHAs with contextual
knowledge, datasets, and their emerging role in clinical decision support. We
also provide new directions toward enriching the user experience of VMHAs with
explainability, safety, and wholesome trustworthiness. Finally, we provide
evaluation metrics and practical considerations for VMHAs beyond the current
literature to build trust between VMHAs and patients in active communications.

##### **A Brief Review of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**
2304.01543v1 by Zahra Sadeghi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Mehmet Akif Cifci,Samina Kausar,Rizwan Rehman,Priyakshi Mahanta,Pranjal Kumar Bora,Ammar Almasri,Rami S. Alkhawaldeh,Sadiq Hussain,Bilal Alatas,Afshin Shoeibi,Hossein Moosaei,Milan Hladik,Saeid Nahavandi,Panos M. Pardalos

XAI refers to the techniques and methods for building AI applications which
assist end users to interpret output and predictions of AI models. Black box AI
applications in high-stakes decision-making situations, such as medical domain
have increased the demand for transparency and explainability since wrong
predictions may have severe consequences. Model explainability and
interpretability are vital successful deployment of AI models in healthcare
practices. AI applications' underlying reasoning needs to be transparent to
clinicians in order to gain their trust. This paper presents a systematic
review of XAI aspects and challenges in the healthcare domain. The primary
goals of this study are to review various XAI methods, their challenges, and
related machine learning models in healthcare. The methods are discussed under
six categories: Features-oriented methods, global methods, concept models,
surrogate models, local pixel-based methods, and human-centric methods. Most
importantly, the paper explores XAI role in healthcare problems to clarify its
necessity in safety-critical applications. The paper intends to establish a
comprehensive understanding of XAI-related applications in the healthcare field
by reviewing the related experimental results. To facilitate future research
for filling research gaps, the importance of XAI models from different
viewpoints and their limitations are investigated.

##### **Reveal to Revise: An Explainable AI Life Cycle for Iterative Bias Correction of Deep Models**
2303.12641v2 by Frederik Pahde,Maximilian Dreyer,Wojciech Samek,Sebastian Lapuschkin

State-of-the-art machine learning models often learn spurious correlations
embedded in the training data. This poses risks when deploying these models for
high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications like skin cancer
detection. To tackle this problem, we propose Reveal to Revise (R2R), a
framework entailing the entire eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) life
cycle, enabling practitioners to iteratively identify, mitigate, and
(re-)evaluate spurious model behavior with a minimal amount of human
interaction. In the first step (1), R2R reveals model weaknesses by finding
outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by
the model. Secondly (2), the responsible artifacts are detected and spatially
localized in the input data, which is then leveraged to (3) revise the model
behavior. Concretely, we apply the methods of RRR, CDEP and ClArC for model
correction, and (4) (re-)evaluate the model's performance and remaining
sensitivity towards the artifact. Using two medical benchmark datasets for
Melanoma detection and bone age estimation, we apply our R2R framework to VGG,
ResNet and EfficientNet architectures and thereby reveal and correct real
dataset-intrinsic artifacts, as well as synthetic variants in a controlled
setting. Completing the XAI life cycle, we demonstrate multiple R2R iterations
to mitigate different biases. Code is available on

##### **Explainable AI for Time Series via Virtual Inspection Layers**
2303.06365v1 by Johanna Vielhaben,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Grégoire Montavon,Wojciech Samek

The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has greatly advanced
in recent years, but progress has mainly been made in computer vision and
natural language processing. For time series, where the input is often not
interpretable, only limited research on XAI is available. In this work, we put
forward a virtual inspection layer, that transforms the time series to an
interpretable representation and allows to propagate relevance attributions to
this representation via local XAI methods like layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP). In this way, we extend the applicability of a family of XAI methods to
domains (e.g. speech) where the input is only interpretable after a
transformation. Here, we focus on the Fourier transformation which is
prominently applied in the interpretation of time series and LRP and refer to
our method as DFT-LRP. We demonstrate the usefulness of DFT-LRP in various time
series classification settings like audio and electronic health records. We
showcase how DFT-LRP reveals differences in the classification strategies of
models trained in different domains (e.g., time vs. frequency domain) or helps
to discover how models act on spurious correlations in the data.

##### **Towards Trust of Explainable AI in Thyroid Nodule Diagnosis**
2303.04731v1 by Truong Thanh Hung Nguyen,Van Binh Truong,Vo Thanh Khang Nguyen,Quoc Hung Cao,Quoc Khanh Nguyen

The ability to explain the prediction of deep learning models to end-users is
an important feature to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for
the medical decision-making process, which is usually considered
non-transparent and challenging to comprehend. In this paper, we apply
state-of-the-art eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to explain
the prediction of the black-box AI models in the thyroid nodule diagnosis
application. We propose new statistic-based XAI methods, namely Kernel Density
Estimation and Density map, to explain the case of no nodule detected. XAI
methods' performances are considered under a qualitative and quantitative
comparison as feedback to improve the data quality and the model performance.
Finally, we survey to assess doctors' and patients' trust in XAI explanations
of the model's decisions on thyroid nodule images.

##### **Cybersecurity of AI medical devices: risks, legislation, and challenges**
2303.03140v1 by Elisabetta Biasin,Erik Kamenjasevic,Kaspar Rosager Ludvigsen

Medical devices and artificial intelligence systems rapidly transform
healthcare provisions. At the same time, due to their nature, AI in or as
medical devices might get exposed to cyberattacks, leading to patient safety
and security risks. This book chapter is divided into three parts. The first
part starts by setting the scene where we explain the role of cybersecurity in
healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI that
is considered a medical device by itself or supports one. To illustrate the
risks such medical devices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of
datasets, social engineering, and data or source code extraction. In the second
part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union's regulatory
framework relevant for ensuring the cybersecurity of AI as or in medical
devices (MDR, NIS Directive, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, the AI Act proposal and
the NIS 2 Directive proposal). Finally, the third part of the paper examines
possible challenges stemming from the EU regulatory framework. In particular,
we look toward the challenges deriving from the two legislative proposals and
their interaction with the existing legislation concerning AI medical devices'
cybersecurity. They are structured as answers to the following questions: (1)
how will the AI Act interact with the MDR regarding the cybersecurity and
safety requirements?; (2) how should we interpret incident notification
requirements from the NIS 2 Directive proposal and MDR?; and (3) what are the
consequences of the evolving term of critical infrastructures?

##### **LAVA: Granular Neuron-Level Explainable AI for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment from Fundus Images**
2302.03008v2 by Nooshin Yousefzadeh,Charlie Tran,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Jinghua Chen,Ruogu Fang,My T. Thai

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the
leading cause of dementia. Early diagnosis is critical for patients to benefit
from potential intervention and treatment. The retina has been hypothesized as
a diagnostic site for AD detection owing to its anatomical connection with the
brain. Developed AI models for this purpose have yet to provide a rational
explanation about the decision and neither infer the stage of disease's
progression. Along this direction, we propose a novel model-agnostic
explainable-AI framework, called Granular Neuron-level Explainer (LAVA), an
interpretation prototype that probes into intermediate layers of the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to assess the AD continuum directly
from the retinal imaging without longitudinal or clinical evaluation. This
method is applied to validate the retinal vasculature as a biomarker and
diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) evaluation. UK Biobank
cognitive tests and vascular morphological features suggest LAVA shows strong
promise and effectiveness in identifying AD stages across the progression
continuum.

##### **Diagrammatization: Rationalizing with diagrammatic AI explanations for abductive-deductive reasoning on hypotheses**
2302.01241v2 by Brian Y. Lim,Joseph P. Cahaly,Chester Y. F. Sng,Adam Chew

Many visualizations have been developed for explainable AI (XAI), but they
often require further reasoning by users to interpret. We argue that XAI should
support diagrammatic and abductive reasoning for the AI to perform hypothesis
generation and evaluation to reduce the interpretability gap. We propose
Diagrammatization to i) perform Peircean abductive-deductive reasoning, ii)
follow domain conventions, and iii) explain with diagrams visually or verbally.
We implemented DiagramNet for a clinical application to predict cardiac
diagnoses from heart auscultation, and explain with shape-based murmur
diagrams. In modeling studies, we found that DiagramNet not only provides
faithful murmur shape explanations, but also has better prediction performance
than baseline models. We further demonstrate the interpretability and
trustworthiness of diagrammatic explanations in a qualitative user study with
medical students, showing that clinically-relevant, diagrammatic explanations
are preferred over technical saliency map explanations. This work contributes
insights into providing domain-conventional abductive explanations for
user-centric XAI.

##### **LesionAid: Vision Transformers-based Skin Lesion Generation and Classification**
2302.01104v1 by Ghanta Sai Krishna,Kundrapu Supriya,Mallikharjuna Rao K,Meetiksha Sorgile

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of human cancer. It is
recognized mainly visually, beginning with clinical screening and continuing
with the dermoscopic examination, histological assessment, and specimen
collection. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform highly segregated
and potentially universal tasks against a classified finegrained object. This
research proposes a novel multi-class prediction framework that classifies skin
lesions based on ViT and ViTGAN. Vision transformers-based GANs (Generative
Adversarial Networks) are utilized to tackle the class imbalance. The framework
consists of four main phases: ViTGANs, Image processing, and explainable AI.
Phase 1 consists of generating synthetic images to balance all the classes in
the dataset. Phase 2 consists of applying different data augmentation
techniques and morphological operations to increase the size of the data.
Phases 3 & 4 involve developing a ViT model for edge computing systems that can
identify patterns and categorize skin lesions from the user's skin visible in
the image. In phase 3, after classifying the lesions into the desired class
with ViT, we will use explainable AI (XAI) that leads to more explainable
results (using activation maps, etc.) while ensuring high predictive accuracy.
Real-time images of skin diseases can capture by a doctor or a patient using
the camera of a mobile application to perform an early examination and
determine the cause of the skin lesion. The whole framework is compared with
the existing frameworks for skin lesion detection.

##### **SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis**
2302.00785v1 by Roxana Daneshjou,Mert Yuksekgonul,Zhuo Ran Cai,Roberto Novoa,James Zou

For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings,
such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or
allow fine-grained error analysis are critical. Many recent methods for
interpretability/explainability and fine-grained error analysis use concepts,
which are meta-labels that are semantically meaningful to humans. However,
there are only a few datasets that include concept-level meta-labels and most
of these meta-labels are relevant for natural images that do not require domain
expertise. Densely annotated datasets in medicine focused on meta-labels that
are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease
is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to
describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset
densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple
disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely
annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick
17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at
least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two
dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin
lesions. Examples include "plaque", "scale", and "erosion". The same concepts
were also used to label 656 skin disease images from the Diverse Dermatology
Images dataset, providing an additional external dataset with diverse skin tone
representations. We review the potential applications for the SkinCon dataset,
such as probing models, concept-based explanations, and concept bottlenecks.
Furthermore, we use SkinCon to demonstrate two of these use cases: debugging
mistakes of an existing dermatology AI model with concepts and developing
interpretable models with post-hoc concept bottleneck models.

##### **Decision-Focused Evaluation: Analyzing Performance of Deployed Restless Multi-Arm Bandits**
2301.07835v1 by Paritosh Verma,Shresth Verma,Aditya Mate,Aparna Taneja,Milind Tambe

Restless multi-arm bandits (RMABs) is a popular decision-theoretic framework
that has been used to model real-world sequential decision making problems in
public health, wildlife conservation, communication systems, and beyond.
Deployed RMAB systems typically operate in two stages: the first predicts the
unknown parameters defining the RMAB instance, and the second employs an
optimization algorithm to solve the constructed RMAB instance.
  In this work we provide and analyze the results from a first-of-its-kind
deployment of an RMAB system in public health domain, aimed at improving
maternal and child health. Our analysis is focused towards understanding the
relationship between prediction accuracy and overall performance of deployed
RMAB systems. This is crucial for determining the value of investing in
improving predictive accuracy towards improving the final system performance,
and is useful for diagnosing, monitoring deployed RMAB systems.
  Using real-world data from our deployed RMAB system, we demonstrate that an
improvement in overall prediction accuracy may even be accompanied by a
degradation in the performance of RMAB system -- a broad investment of
resources to improve overall prediction accuracy may not yield expected
results. Following this, we develop decision-focused evaluation metrics to
evaluate the predictive component and show that it is better at explaining
(both empirically and theoretically) the overall performance of a deployed RMAB
system.

##### **Exemplars and Counterexemplars Explanations for Image Classifiers, Targeting Skin Lesion Labeling**
2302.03033v1 by Carlo Metta,Riccardo Guidotti,Yuan Yin,Patrick Gallinari,Salvatore Rinzivillo

Explainable AI consists in developing mechanisms allowing for an interaction
between decision systems and humans by making the decisions of the formers
understandable. This is particularly important in sensitive contexts like in
the medical domain. We propose a use case study, for skin lesion diagnosis,
illustrating how it is possible to provide the practitioner with explanations
on the decisions of a state of the art deep neural network classifier trained
to characterize skin lesions from examples. Our framework consists of a trained
classifier onto which an explanation module operates. The latter is able to
offer the practitioner exemplars and counterexemplars for the classification
diagnosis thus allowing the physician to interact with the automatic diagnosis
system. The exemplars are generated via an adversarial autoencoder. We
illustrate the behavior of the system on representative examples.

##### **Monotonicity for AI ethics and society: An empirical study of the monotonic neural additive model in criminology, education, health care, and finance**
2301.07060v1 by Dangxing Chen,Luyao Zhang

Algorithm fairness in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is
essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,
fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)
community has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity,
especially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses
another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a
vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide
human decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first
systematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive
models (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both
individual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics
and society. We have found, through a hybrid method of theoretical reasoning,
simulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity
axioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,
health care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary
research at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and
human-computer interactions (HCIs). By evidencing the catastrophic consequences
if monotonicity is not met, we address the significance of monotonicity
requirements in AI applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MNAMs are an
effective fairness-aware ML approach by imposing monotonicity restrictions
integrating human intelligence.

##### **Rationalizing Predictions by Adversarial Information Calibration**
2301.06009v1 by Lei Sha,Oana-Maria Camburu,Thomas Lukasiewicz

Explaining the predictions of AI models is paramount in safety-critical
applications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for
a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an
instance that lead the model to give its prediction on that instance. For
example, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive
rationale for the prediction of ``Theft''. Previous works on generating
extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects
the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that
makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One
disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select
features comes from the comparison of the answers given by the predictor to the
ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from
the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train
two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand
in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor
model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first
model is used as a guide for the second model. We use an adversarial technique
to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the
difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected
features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose a
language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent
rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task, a hate speech
recognition task as well as on three tasks from the legal domain show the
effectiveness of our approach to rationale extraction.

##### **Semantic match: Debugging feature attribution methods in XAI for healthcare**
2301.02080v3 by Giovanni Cinà,Tabea E. Röber,Rob Goedhart,Ş. İlker Birbil

The recent spike in certified Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for
healthcare has renewed the debate around adoption of this technology. One
thread of such debate concerns Explainable AI (XAI) and its promise to render
AI devices more transparent and trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical
AI space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI
techniques and especially feature attribution methods, questioning their use
and inclusion in guidelines and standards. Despite valid concerns, we argue
that existing criticism on the viability of post-hoc local explainability
methods throws away the baby with the bathwater by generalizing a problem that
is specific to image data. We begin by characterizing the problem as a lack of
semantic match between explanations and human understanding. To understand when
feature importance can be used reliably, we introduce a distinction between
feature importance of low- and high-level features. We argue that for data
types where low-level features come endowed with a clear semantics, such as
tabular data like Electronic Health Records (EHRs), semantic match can be
obtained, and thus feature attribution methods can still be employed in a
meaningful and useful way. Finally, we sketch a procedure to test whether
semantic match has been achieved.

##### **Context-dependent Explainability and Contestability for Trustworthy Medical Artificial Intelligence: Misclassification Identification of Morbidity Recognition Models in Preterm Infants**
2212.08821v1 by Isil Guzey,Ozlem Ucar,Nukhet Aladag Ciftdemir,Betul Acunas

Although machine learning (ML) models of AI achieve high performances in
medicine, they are not free of errors. Empowering clinicians to identify
incorrect model recommendations is crucial for engendering trust in medical AI.
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to address this requirement by clarifying AI
reasoning to support the end users. Several studies on biomedical imaging
achieved promising results recently. Nevertheless, solutions for models using
tabular data are not sufficient to meet the requirements of clinicians yet.
This paper proposes a methodology to support clinicians in identifying failures
of ML models trained with tabular data. We built our methodology on three main
pillars: decomposing the feature set by leveraging clinical context latent
space, assessing the clinical association of global explanations, and Latent
Space Similarity (LSS) based local explanations. We demonstrated our
methodology on ML-based recognition of preterm infant morbidities caused by
infection. The risk of mortality, lifelong disability, and antibiotic
resistance due to model failures was an open research question in this domain.
We achieved to identify misclassification cases of two models with our
approach. By contextualizing local explanations, our solution provides
clinicians with actionable insights to support their autonomy for informed
final decisions.

##### **It is not "accuracy vs. explainability" -- we need both for trustworthy AI systems**
2212.11136v2 by D. Petkovic

We are witnessing the emergence of an AI economy and society where AI
technologies are increasingly impacting health care, business, transportation
and many aspects of everyday life. Many successes have been reported where AI
systems even surpassed the accuracy of human experts. However, AI systems may
produce errors, can exhibit bias, may be sensitive to noise in the data, and
often lack technical and judicial transparency resulting in reduction in trust
and challenges in their adoption. These recent shortcomings and concerns have
been documented in scientific but also in general press such as accidents with
self driving cars, biases in healthcare, hiring and face recognition systems
for people of color, seemingly correct medical decisions later found to be made
due to wrong reasons etc. This resulted in emergence of many government and
regulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy
and robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight,
elimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in
delivery of trustworthy AI systems motivated intense research on explainable AI
systems (XAI). Aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how
AI systems make their decisions. In this paper we first briefly summarize
current XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments of accuracy vs.
explainability for being mutually exclusive and being focused only on deep
learning. We then present our recommendations for the use of XAI in full
lifecycle of high stakes trustworthy AI systems delivery, e.g. development,
validation and certification, and trustworthy production and maintenance.

##### **SimpleMind adds thinking to deep neural networks**
2212.00951v1 by Youngwon Choi,M. Wasil Wahi-Anwar,Matthew S. Brown

Deep neural networks (DNNs) detect patterns in data and have shown
versatility and strong performance in many computer vision applications.
However, DNNs alone are susceptible to obvious mistakes that violate simple,
common sense concepts and are limited in their ability to use explicit
knowledge to guide their search and decision making. While overall DNN
performance metrics may be good, these obvious errors, coupled with a lack of
explainability, have prevented widespread adoption for crucial tasks such as
medical image analysis. The purpose of this paper is to introduce SimpleMind,
an open-source software framework for Cognitive AI focused on medical image
understanding. It allows creation of a knowledge base that describes expected
characteristics and relationships between image objects in an intuitive
human-readable form. The SimpleMind framework brings thinking to DNNs by: (1)
providing methods for reasoning with the knowledge base about image content,
such as spatial inferencing and conditional reasoning to check DNN outputs; (2)
applying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents,
that are chained together to accomplish image preprocessing, DNN prediction,
and result post-processing, and (3) performing automatic co-optimization of all
knowledge base parameters to adapt agents to specific problems. SimpleMind
enables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing
cross checking between DNN outputs. This machine reasoning improves the
reliability and trustworthiness of DNNs through an interpretable model and
explainable decisions. Example applications are provided that demonstrate how
SimpleMind supports and improves deep neural networks by embedding them within
a Cognitive AI framework.

##### **Attribution-based XAI Methods in Computer Vision: A Review**
2211.14736v1 by Kumar Abhishek,Deeksha Kamath

The advancements in deep learning-based methods for visual perception tasks
have seen astounding growth in the last decade, with widespread adoption in a
plethora of application areas from autonomous driving to clinical decision
support systems. Despite their impressive performance, these deep
learning-based models remain fairly opaque in their decision-making process,
making their deployment in human-critical tasks a risky endeavor. This in turn
makes understanding the decisions made by these models crucial for their
reliable deployment. Explainable AI (XAI) methods attempt to address this by
offering explanations for such black-box deep learning methods. In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive survey of attribution-based XAI methods in computer
vision and review the existing literature for gradient-based,
perturbation-based, and contrastive methods for XAI, and provide insights on
the key challenges in developing and evaluating robust XAI methods.

##### **Privacy Meets Explainability: A Comprehensive Impact Benchmark**
2211.04110v1 by Saifullah Saifullah,Dominique Mercier,Adriano Lucieri,Andreas Dengel,Sheraz Ahmed

Since the mid-10s, the era of Deep Learning (DL) has continued to this day,
bringing forth new superlatives and innovations each year. Nevertheless, the
speed with which these innovations translate into real applications lags behind
this fast pace. Safety-critical applications, in particular, underlie strict
regulatory and ethical requirements which need to be taken care of and are
still active areas of debate. eXplainable AI (XAI) and privacy-preserving
machine learning (PPML) are both crucial research fields, aiming at mitigating
some of the drawbacks of prevailing data-hungry black-box models in DL. Despite
brisk research activity in the respective fields, no attention has yet been
paid to their interaction. This work is the first to investigate the impact of
private learning techniques on generated explanations for DL-based models. In
an extensive experimental analysis covering various image and time series
datasets from multiple domains, as well as varying privacy techniques, XAI
methods, and model architectures, the effects of private training on generated
explanations are studied. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in
explanations through the introduction of privacy. Apart from reporting
individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for
the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the
interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this work is a first step
towards overcoming the remaining hurdles for practically applicable AI in
safety-critical domains.

##### **Predicting Treatment Adherence of Tuberculosis Patients at Scale**
2211.02943v2 by Mihir Kulkarni,Satvik Golechha,Rishi Raj,Jithin Sreedharan,Ankit Bhardwaj,Santanu Rathod,Bhavin Vadera,Jayakrishna Kurada,Sanjay Mattoo,Rajendra Joshi,Kirankumar Rade,Alpan Raval

Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause of
death, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new
cases reported globally in $2020$. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the
medication regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus,
proactively identifying patients at risk of dropping off their medication
regimen enables corrective measures to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy
measure of extreme non-adherence and a dataset of nearly $700,000$ patients
from four states in India, we formulate and solve the machine learning (ML)
problem of early prediction of non-adherence based on a custom rank-based
metric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines, achieving a $\sim
100\%$ lift over rule-based baselines and $\sim 214\%$ over a random
classifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We
deal with various issues in the process, including data quality,
high-cardinality categorical data, low target prevalence, distribution shift,
variation across cohorts, algorithmic fairness, and the need for robustness and
explainability. Our findings indicate that risk stratification of non-adherent
patients is a viable, deployable-at-scale ML solution. As the official AI
partner of India's Central TB Division, we are working on multiple city and
state-level pilots with the goal of pan-India deployment.

##### **Explainable AI over the Internet of Things (IoT): Overview, State-of-the-Art and Future Directions**
2211.01036v2 by Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal,Quoc-Viet Pham,Rukhsana Ruby,Zhaohui Yang,Chunmei Xu,Zhaoyang Zhang

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is transforming the field of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enhancing the trust of end-users in machines.
As the number of connected devices keeps on growing, the Internet of Things
(IoT) market needs to be trustworthy for the end-users. However, existing
literature still lacks a systematic and comprehensive survey work on the use of
XAI for IoT. To bridge this lacking, in this paper, we address the XAI
frameworks with a focus on their characteristics and support for IoT. We
illustrate the widely-used XAI services for IoT applications, such as security
enhancement, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and
Internet of City Things (IoCT). We also suggest the implementation choice of
XAI models over IoT systems in these applications with appropriate examples and
summarize the key inferences for future works. Moreover, we present the
cutting-edge development in edge XAI structures and the support of
sixth-generation (6G) communication services for IoT applications, along with
key inferences. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic
compilation on the development of XAI-based frameworks tailored for the demands
of future IoT use cases.

##### **Human-centered XAI for Burn Depth Characterization**
2210.13535v2 by Maxwell J. Jacobson,Daniela Chanci Arrubla,Maria Romeo Tricas,Gayle Gordillo,Yexiang Xue,Chandan Sen,Juan Wachs

Approximately 1.25 million people in the United States are treated each year
for burn injuries. Precise burn injury classification is an important aspect of
the medical AI field. In this work, we propose an explainable human-in-the-loop
framework for improving burn ultrasound classification models. Our framework
leverages an explanation system based on the LIME classification explainer to
corroborate and integrate a burn expert's knowledge -- suggesting new features
and ensuring the validity of the model. Using this framework, we discover that
B-mode ultrasound classifiers can be enhanced by supplying textural features.
More specifically, we confirm that texture features based on the Gray Level
Co-occurance Matrix (GLCM) of ultrasound frames can increase the accuracy of
transfer learned burn depth classifiers. We test our hypothesis on real data
from porcine subjects. We show improvements in the accuracy of burn depth
classification -- from ~88% to ~94% -- once modified according to our
framework.

##### **What Do End-Users Really Want? Investigation of Human-Centered XAI for Mobile Health Apps**
2210.03506v1 by Katharina Weitz,Alexander Zellner,Elisabeth André

In healthcare, AI systems support clinicians and patients in diagnosis,
treatment, and monitoring, but many systems' poor explainability remains
challenging for practical application. Overcoming this barrier is the goal of
explainable AI (XAI). However, an explanation can be perceived differently and,
thus, not solve the black-box problem for everyone. The domain of
Human-Centered AI deals with this problem by adapting AI to users. We present a
user-centered persona concept to evaluate XAI and use it to investigate
end-users preferences for various explanation styles and contents in a mobile
health stress monitoring application. The results of our online survey show
that users' demographics and personality, as well as the type of explanation,
impact explanation preferences, indicating that these are essential features
for XAI design. We subsumed the results in three prototypical user personas:
power-, casual-, and privacy-oriented users. Our insights bring an interactive,
human-centered XAI closer to practical application.

##### **Explainable AI based Glaucoma Detection using Transfer Learning and LIME**
2210.03332v1 by Touhidul Islam Chayan,Anita Islam,Eftykhar Rahman,Md. Tanzim Reza,Tasnim Sakib Apon,MD. Golam Rabiul Alam

Glaucoma is the second driving reason for partial or complete blindness among
all the visual deficiencies which mainly occurs because of excessive pressure
in the eye due to anxiety or depression which damages the optic nerve and
creates complications in vision. Traditional glaucoma screening is a
time-consuming process that necessitates the medical professionals' constant
attention, and even so time to time due to the time constrains and pressure
they fail to classify correctly that leads to wrong treatment. Numerous efforts
have been made to automate the entire glaucoma classification procedure
however, these existing models in general have a black box characteristics that
prevents users from understanding the key reasons behind the prediction and
thus medical practitioners generally can not rely on these system. In this
article after comparing with various pre-trained models, we propose a transfer
learning model that is able to classify Glaucoma with 94.71\% accuracy. In
addition, we have utilized Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanations(LIME) that introduces explainability in our system. This
improvement enables medical professionals obtain important and comprehensive
information that aid them in making judgments. It also lessen the opacity and
fragility of the traditional deep learning models.

2209.15398v1 by Lennart Brocki,Wistan Marchadour,Jonas Maison,Bogdan Badic,Panagiotis Papadimitroulas,Mathieu Hatt,Franck Vermet,Neo Christopher Chung

Deep learning has shown superb performance in detecting objects and
classifying images, ensuring a great promise for analyzing medical imaging.
Translating the success of deep learning to medical imaging, in which doctors
need to understand the underlying process, requires the capability to interpret
and explain the prediction of neural networks. Interpretability of deep neural
networks often relies on estimating the importance of input features (e.g.,
pixels) with respect to the outcome (e.g., class probability). However, a
number of importance estimators (also known as saliency maps) have been
developed and it is unclear which ones are more relevant for medical imaging
applications. In the present work, we investigated the performance of several
importance estimators in explaining the classification of computed tomography
(CT) images by a convolutional deep network, using three distinct evaluation
metrics. First, the model-centric fidelity measures a decrease in the model
accuracy when certain inputs are perturbed. Second, concordance between
importance scores and the expert-defined segmentation masks is measured on a
pixel level by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Third, we
measure a region-wise overlap between a XRAI-based map and the segmentation
mask by Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC). Overall, two versions of SmoothGrad
topped the fidelity and ROC rankings, whereas both Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad excelled in DSC evaluation. Interestingly, there was a critical
discrepancy between model-centric (fidelity) and human-centric (ROC and DSC)
evaluation. Expert expectation and intuition embedded in segmentation maps does
not necessarily align with how the model arrived at its prediction.
Understanding this difference in interpretability would help harnessing the
power of deep learning in medicine.

##### **An Interactive Interpretability System for Breast Cancer Screening with Deep Learning**
2210.08979v1 by Yuzhe Lu,Adam Perer

Deep learning methods, in particular convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as a powerful tool in medical image computing tasks. While these
complex models provide excellent performance, their black-box nature may hinder
real-world adoption in high-stakes decision-making. In this paper, we propose
an interactive system to take advantage of state-of-the-art interpretability
techniques to assist radiologists with breast cancer screening. Our system
integrates a deep learning model into the radiologists' workflow and provides
novel interactions to promote understanding of the model's decision-making
process. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system can take advantage of user
interactions progressively to provide finer-grained explainability reports with
little labeling overhead. Due to the generic nature of the adopted
interpretability technique, our system is domain-agnostic and can be used for
many different medical image computing tasks, presenting a novel perspective on
how we can leverage visual analytics to transform originally static
interpretability techniques to augment human decision making and promote the
adoption of medical AI.

##### **Explainable AI for clinical and remote health applications: a survey on tabular and time series data**
2209.06528v1 by Flavio Di Martino,Franca Delmastro

Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of
healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI
systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions
and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive
and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same
attention across different research areas and data types, especially in
healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are
based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly
analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI
methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the
healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5
years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided
to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical
validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality
evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure
effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main
research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI
methods.

2208.14742v1 by Gaetan Dissez,Nicole Tay,Tom Dyer,Matthew Tam,Richard Dittrich,David Doyne,James Hoare,Jackson J. Pat,Stephanie Patterson,Amanda Stockham,Qaiser Malik,Tom Naunton Morgan,Paul Williams,Liliana Garcia-Mondragon,Jordan Smith,George Pearse,Simon Rasalingham

Objectives: The present study evaluated the impact of a commercially
available explainable AI algorithm in augmenting the ability of clinicians to
identify lung cancer on chest X-rays (CXR).
  Design: This retrospective study evaluated the performance of 11 clinicians
for detecting lung cancer from chest radiographs, with and without assistance
from a commercially available AI algorithm (red dot, Behold.ai) that predicts
suspected lung cancer from CXRs. Clinician performance was evaluated against
clinically confirmed diagnoses.
  Setting: The study analysed anonymised patient data from an NHS hospital; the
dataset consisted of 400 chest radiographs from adult patients (18 years and
above) who had a CXR performed in 2020, with corresponding clinical text
reports.
  Participants: A panel of readers consisting of 11 clinicians (consultant
radiologists, radiologist trainees and reporting radiographers) participated in
this study.
  Main outcome measures: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and
precision for detecting lung cancer on CXRs by clinicians, with and without AI
input. Agreement rates between clinicians and performance standard deviation
were also evaluated, with and without AI input.
  Results: The use of the AI algorithm by clinicians led to an improved overall
performance for lung tumour detection, achieving an overall increase of 17.4%
of lung cancers being identified on CXRs which would have otherwise been
missed, an overall increase in detection of smaller tumours, a 24% and 13%
increased detection of stage 1 and stage 2 lung cancers respectively, and
standardisation of clinician performance.
  Conclusions: This study showed great promise in the clinical utility of AI
algorithms in improving early lung cancer diagnosis and promoting health equity
through overall improvement in reader performances, without impacting
downstream imaging resources.

##### **GAN-based generative modelling for dermatological applications -- comparative study**
2208.11702v1 by Sandra Carrasco Limeros,Sylwia Majchrowska,Mohamad Khir Zoubi,Anna Rosén,Juulia Suvilehto,Lisa Sjöblom,Magnus Kjellberg

The lack of sufficiently large open medical databases is one of the biggest
challenges in AI-powered healthcare. Synthetic data created using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) appears to be a good solution to mitigate the
issues with privacy policies. The other type of cure is decentralized protocol
across multiple medical institutions without exchanging local data samples. In
this paper, we explored unconditional and conditional GANs in centralized and
decentralized settings. The centralized setting imitates studies on large but
highly unbalanced skin lesion dataset, while the decentralized one simulates a
more realistic hospital scenario with three institutions. We evaluated models'
performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, speed of training, and predictive
ability of classifiers trained on the generated synthetic data. In addition we
provided explainability through exploration of latent space and embeddings
projection focused both on global and local explanations. Calculated distance
between real images and their projections in the latent space proved the
authenticity and generalization of trained GANs, which is one of the main
concerns in this type of applications. The open source code for conducted
studies is publicly available at

##### **Planning and Scheduling in Digital Health with Answer Set Programming**
2208.03099v1 by Marco Mochi

In the hospital world there are several complex combinatory problems, and
solving these problems is important to increase the degree of patients'
satisfaction and the quality of care offered. The problems in the healthcare
are complex since to solve them several constraints and different type of
resources should be taken into account. Moreover, the solutions must be
evaluated in a small amount of time to ensure the usability in real scenarios.
We plan to propose solutions to these kind of problems both expanding already
tested solutions and by modelling solutions for new problems, taking into
account the literature and by using real data when available. Solving these
kind of problems is important but, since the European Commission established
with the General Data Protection Regulation that each person has the right to
ask for explanation of the decision taken by an AI, without developing
Explainability methodologies the usage of AI based solvers e.g. those based on
Answer Set programming will be limited. Thus, another part of the research will
be devoted to study and propose new methodologies for explaining the solutions
obtained.

##### **AI Approaches in Processing and Using Data in Personalized Medicine**
2208.04698v1 by Mirjana Ivanovic,Serge Autexier,Miltiadis Kokkonidis

In modern dynamic constantly developing society, more and more people suffer
from chronic and serious diseases and doctors and patients need special and
sophisticated medical and health support. Accordingly, prominent health
stakeholders have recognized the importance of development of such services to
make patients life easier. Such support requires the collection of huge amount
of patients complex data like clinical, environmental, nutritional, daily
activities, variety of data from smart wearable devices, data from clothing
equipped with sensors etc. Holistic patients data must be properly aggregated,
processed, analyzed, and presented to the doctors and caregivers to recommend
adequate treatment and actions to improve patients health related parameters
and general wellbeing. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques offer the
opportunity to analyze such big data, consume them, and derive new knowledge to
support personalized medical decisions. New approaches like those based on
advanced machine learning, federated learning, transfer learning, explainable
artificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of health and
medical data in future. In this paper, we will present some crucial aspects and
characteristic examples in the area of application of a range of artificial
intelligence approaches in personalized medical decisions.

##### **TRUST-LAPSE: An Explainable and Actionable Mistrust Scoring Framework for Model Monitoring**
2207.11290v2 by Nandita Bhaskhar,Daniel L. Rubin,Christopher Lee-Messer

Continuous monitoring of trained ML models to determine when their
predictions should and should not be trusted is essential for their safe
deployment. Such a framework ought to be high-performing, explainable, post-hoc
and actionable. We propose TRUST-LAPSE, a "mistrust" scoring framework for
continuous model monitoring. We assess the trustworthiness of each input
sample's model prediction using a sequence of latent-space embeddings.
Specifically, (a) our latent-space mistrust score estimates mistrust using
distance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity metrics (cosine
similarity) in the latent-space and (b) our sequential mistrust score
determines deviations in correlations over the sequence of past input
representations in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm for
actionable continuous monitoring. We evaluate TRUST-LAPSE via two downstream
tasks: (1) distributionally shifted input detection, and (2) data drift
detection. We evaluate across diverse domains - audio and vision using public
datasets and further benchmark our approach on challenging, real-world
electroencephalograms (EEG) datasets for seizure detection. Our latent-space
mistrust scores achieve state-of-the-art results with AUROCs of 84.1 (vision),
73.9 (audio), and 77.1 (clinical EEGs), outperforming baselines by over 10
points. We expose critical failures in popular baselines that remain
insensitive to input semantic content, rendering them unfit for real-world
model monitoring. We show that our sequential mistrust scores achieve high
drift detection rates; over 90% of the streams show < 20% error for all
domains. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show
that our mistrust scores are more robust and provide explainability for easy
adoption into practice.

##### **Revealing Unfair Models by Mining Interpretable Evidence**
2207.05811v1 by Mohit Bajaj,Lingyang Chu,Vittorio Romaniello,Gursimran Singh,Jian Pei,Zirui Zhou,Lanjun Wang,Yong Zhang

The popularity of machine learning has increased the risk of unfair models
getting deployed in high-stake applications, such as justice system,
drug/vaccination design, and medical diagnosis. Although there are effective
methods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and
explain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing
unfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical
step towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle
the novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence
(RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data
instances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable,
we also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules
that characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from
the other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on
many real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid
evidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it
is much more scalable than all of the baseline methods.

##### **From Correlation to Causation: Formalizing Interpretable Machine Learning as a Statistical Process**
2207.04969v1 by Lukas Klein,Mennatallah El-Assady,Paul F. Jäger

Explainable AI (XAI) is a necessity in safety-critical systems such as in
clinical diagnostics due to a high risk for fatal decisions. Currently,
however, XAI resembles a loose collection of methods rather than a well-defined
process. In this work, we elaborate on conceptual similarities between the
largest subgroup of XAI, interpretable machine learning (IML), and classical
statistics. Based on these similarities, we present a formalization of IML
along the lines of a statistical process. Adopting this statistical view allows
us to interpret machine learning models and IML methods as sophisticated
statistical tools. Based on this interpretation, we infer three key questions,
which we identify as crucial for the success and adoption of IML in
safety-critical settings. By formulating these questions, we further aim to
spark a discussion about what distinguishes IML from classical statistics and
what our perspective implies for the future of the field.

##### **Pose Priors from Language Models**
2405.03689v1 by Sanjay Subramanian,Evonne Ng,Lea Müller,Dan Klein,Shiry Ginosar,Trevor Darrell

We present a zero-shot pose optimization method that enforces accurate
physical contact constraints when estimating the 3D pose of humans. Our central
insight is that since language is often used to describe physical interaction,
large pretrained text-based models can act as priors on pose estimation.
  We can thus leverage this insight to improve pose estimation by converting
natural language descriptors, generated by a large multimodal model (LMM), into
tractable losses to constrain the 3D pose optimization. Despite its simplicity,
our method produces surprisingly compelling pose reconstructions of people in
close contact, correctly capturing the semantics of the social and physical
interactions. We demonstrate that our method rivals more complex
state-of-the-art approaches that require expensive human annotation of contact
points and training specialized models. Moreover, unlike previous approaches,
our method provides a unified framework for resolving self-contact and
person-to-person contact.

##### **Large Language Models Reveal Information Operation Goals, Tactics, and Narrative Frames**
2405.03688v1 by Keith Burghardt,Kai Chen,Kristina Lerman

Adversarial information operations can destabilize societies by undermining
fair elections, manipulating public opinions on policies, and promoting scams.
Despite their widespread occurrence and potential impacts, our understanding of
influence campaigns is limited by manual analysis of messages and subjective
interpretation of their observable behavior. In this paper, we explore whether
these limitations can be mitigated with large language models (LLMs), using
GPT-3.5 as a case-study for coordinated campaign annotation. We first use
GPT-3.5 to scrutinize 126 identified information operations spanning over a
decade. We utilize a number of metrics to quantify the close (if imperfect)
agreement between LLM and ground truth descriptions. We next extract
coordinated campaigns from two large multilingual datasets from X (formerly
Twitter) that respectively discuss the 2022 French election and 2023 Balikaran
Philippine-U.S. military exercise in 2023. For each coordinated campaign, we
use GPT-3.5 to analyze posts related to a specific concern and extract goals,
tactics, and narrative frames, both before and after critical events (such as
the date of an election). While the GPT-3.5 sometimes disagrees with subjective
interpretation, its ability to summarize and interpret demonstrates LLMs'
potential to extract higher-order indicators from text to provide a more
complete picture of the information campaigns compared to previous methods.

##### **Language-Image Models with 3D Understanding**
2405.03685v1 by Jang Hyun Cho,Boris Ivanovic,Yulong Cao,Edward Schmerling,Yue Wang,Xinshuo Weng,Boyi Li,Yurong You,Philipp Krähenbühl,Yan Wang,Marco Pavone

Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown incredible capabilities
in a variety of 2D vision and language tasks. We extend MLLMs' perceptual
capabilities to ground and reason about images in 3-dimensional space. To that
end, we first develop a large-scale pre-training dataset for 2D and 3D called
LV3D by combining multiple existing 2D and 3D recognition datasets under a
common task formulation: as multi-turn question-answering. Next, we introduce a
new MLLM named Cube-LLM and pre-train it on LV3D. We show that pure data
scaling makes a strong 3D perception capability without 3D specific
architectural design or training objective. Cube-LLM exhibits intriguing
properties similar to LLMs: (1) Cube-LLM can apply chain-of-thought prompting
to improve 3D understanding from 2D context information. (2) Cube-LLM can
follow complex and diverse instructions and adapt to versatile input and output
formats. (3) Cube-LLM can be visually prompted such as 2D box or a set of
candidate 3D boxes from specialists. Our experiments on outdoor benchmarks
demonstrate that Cube-LLM significantly outperforms existing baselines by 21.3
points of AP-BEV on the Talk2Car dataset for 3D grounded reasoning and 17.7
points on the DriveLM dataset for complex reasoning about driving scenarios,
respectively. Cube-LLM also shows competitive results in general MLLM
benchmarks such as refCOCO for 2D grounding with (87.0) average score, as well
as visual question answering benchmarks such as VQAv2, GQA, SQA, POPE, etc. for
complex reasoning. Our project is available at

##### **Towards A Human-in-the-Loop LLM Approach to Collaborative Discourse Analysis**
2405.03677v1 by Clayton Cohn,Caitlin Snyder,Justin Montenegro,Gautam Biswas

LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in contextualizing their outputs using
human input, often matching or beating human-level performance on a variety of
tasks. However, LLMs have not yet been used to characterize synergistic
learning in students' collaborative discourse. In this exploratory work, we
take a first step towards adopting a human-in-the-loop prompt engineering
approach with GPT-4-Turbo to summarize and categorize students' synergistic
learning during collaborative discourse. Our preliminary findings suggest
GPT-4-Turbo may be able to characterize students' synergistic learning in a
manner comparable to humans and that our approach warrants further
investigation.

##### **MemoryMamba: Memory-Augmented State Space Model for Defect Recognition**
2405.03673v1 by Qianning Wang,He Hu,Yucheng Zhou

As automation advances in manufacturing, the demand for precise and
sophisticated defect detection technologies grows. Existing vision models for
defect recognition methods are insufficient for handling the complexities and
variations of defects in contemporary manufacturing settings. These models
especially struggle in scenarios involving limited or imbalanced defect data.
In this work, we introduce MemoryMamba, a novel memory-augmented state space
model (SSM), designed to overcome the limitations of existing defect
recognition models. MemoryMamba integrates the state space model with the
memory augmentation mechanism, enabling the system to maintain and retrieve
essential defect-specific information in training. Its architecture is designed
to capture dependencies and intricate defect characteristics, which are crucial
for effective defect detection. In the experiments, MemoryMamba was evaluated
across four industrial datasets with diverse defect types and complexities. The
model consistently outperformed other methods, demonstrating its capability to
adapt to various defect recognition scenarios.

##### **ScrewMimic: Bimanual Imitation from Human Videos with Screw Space Projection**
2405.03666v1 by Arpit Bahety,Priyanka Mandikal,Ben Abbatematteo,Roberto Martín-Martín

Bimanual manipulation is a longstanding challenge in robotics due to the
large number of degrees of freedom and the strict spatial and temporal
synchronization required to generate meaningful behavior. Humans learn bimanual
manipulation skills by watching other humans and by refining their abilities
through play. In this work, we aim to enable robots to learn bimanual
manipulation behaviors from human video demonstrations and fine-tune them
through interaction. Inspired by seminal work in psychology and biomechanics,
we propose modeling the interaction between two hands as a serial kinematic
linkage -- as a screw motion, in particular, that we use to define a new action
space for bimanual manipulation: screw actions. We introduce ScrewMimic, a
framework that leverages this novel action representation to facilitate
learning from human demonstration and self-supervised policy fine-tuning. Our
experiments demonstrate that ScrewMimic is able to learn several complex
bimanual behaviors from a single human video demonstration, and that it
outperforms baselines that interpret demonstrations and fine-tune directly in
the original space of motion of both arms. For more information and video

##### **Can LLMs Deeply Detect Complex Malicious Queries? A Framework for Jailbreaking via Obfuscating Intent**
2405.03654v2 by Shang Shang,Xinqiang Zhao,Zhongjiang Yao,Yepeng Yao,Liya Su,Zijing Fan,Xiaodan Zhang,Zhengwei Jiang

To demonstrate and address the underlying maliciousness, we propose a
theoretical hypothesis and analytical approach, and introduce a new black-box
jailbreak attack methodology named IntentObfuscator, exploiting this identified
flaw by obfuscating the true intentions behind user prompts.This approach
compels LLMs to inadvertently generate restricted content, bypassing their
built-in content security measures. We detail two implementations under this
framework: "Obscure Intention" and "Create Ambiguity", which manipulate query
complexity and ambiguity to evade malicious intent detection effectively. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the IntentObfuscator method across
several models, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Qwen and Baichuan, achieving
an average jailbreak success rate of 69.21\%. Notably, our tests on
ChatGPT-3.5, which claims 100 million weekly active users, achieved a
remarkable success rate of 83.65\%. We also extend our validation to diverse
types of sensitive content like graphic violence, racism, sexism, political
sensitivity, cybersecurity threats, and criminal skills, further proving the
substantial impact of our findings on enhancing 'Red Team' strategies against
LLM content security frameworks.

##### **When LLMs Meet Cybersecurity: A Systematic Literature Review**
2405.03644v1 by Jie Zhang,Haoyu Bu,Hui Wen,Yu Chen,Lun Li,Hongsong Zhu

The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new
avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an
ever-evolving threat landscape and need for innovative technologies. Despite
initial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a
lack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper bridge this
gap by providing a systematic literature review, encompassing an analysis of
over 180 works, spanning across 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios.
Our comprehensive overview addresses three critical research questions: the
construction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, LLMs' applications in various
cybersecurity tasks, and the existing challenges and further research in this
area. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in
enhancing cybersecurity practices, and serve as a valuable resource for
applying LLMs in this doamin. We also maintain and regularly updated list of
practical guides on LLMs for cybersecurity at

##### **Detecting Android Malware: From Neural Embeddings to Hands-On Validation with BERTroid**
2405.03620v1 by Meryam Chaieb,Mostafa Anouar Ghorab,Mohamed Aymen Saied

As cyber threats and malware attacks increasingly alarm both individuals and
businesses, the urgency for proactive malware countermeasures intensifies. This
has driven a rising interest in automated machine learning solutions.
Transformers, a cutting-edge category of attention-based deep learning methods,
have demonstrated remarkable success. In this paper, we present BERTroid, an
innovative malware detection model built on the BERT architecture. Overall,
BERTroid emerged as a promising solution for combating Android malware. Its
ability to outperform state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its potential as
a proactive defense mechanism against malicious software attacks. Additionally,
we evaluate BERTroid on multiple datasets to assess its performance across
diverse scenarios. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, our approach has
demonstrated promising resilience against the rapid evolution of malware on
Android systems. While the machine learning model captures broad patterns, we
emphasize the role of manual validation for deeper comprehension and insight
into these behaviors. This human intervention is critical for discerning
intricate and context-specific behaviors, thereby validating and reinforcing
the model's findings.

##### **A Controlled Experiment on the Energy Efficiency of the Source Code Generated by Code Llama**
2405.03616v1 by Vlad-Andrei Cursaru,Laura Duits,Joel Milligan,Damla Ural,Berta Rodriguez Sanchez,Vincenzo Stoico,Ivano Malavolta

Context. Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate code. LLMs recently became essential to increase the
productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software
development. Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only
to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their
software. However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy
efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools. Released in August 2023,
Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.
  Goal. In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy
efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.
  Method. We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks
implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. We ask Code Llama to generate the
code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures. Therefore, we
execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.
  Results. Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code
Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific
code problem at hand. Also, human implementations tend to be more energy
efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human
counterpart. Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate
energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well
as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of
generated code.
  Conclusions. According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does
not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so. Therefore,
software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code
before integrating it into the software system under development.

##### **GREEN: Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation**
2405.03595v1 by Sophie Ostmeier,Justin Xu,Zhihong Chen,Maya Varma,Louis Blankemeier,Christian Bluethgen,Arne Edward Michalson,Michael Moseley,Curtis Langlotz,Akshay S Chaudhari,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck

Evaluating radiology reports is a challenging problem as factual correctness
is extremely important due to the need for accurate medical communication about
medical images. Existing automatic evaluation metrics either suffer from
failing to consider factual correctness (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or are limited
in their interpretability (e.g., F1CheXpert and F1RadGraph). In this paper, we
introduce GREEN (Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation), a
radiology report generation metric that leverages the natural language
understanding of language models to identify and explain clinically significant
errors in candidate reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to
current metrics, GREEN offers: 1) a score aligned with expert preferences, 2)
human interpretable explanations of clinically significant errors, enabling
feedback loops with end-users, and 3) a lightweight open-source method that
reaches the performance of commercial counterparts. We validate our GREEN
metric by comparing it to GPT-4, as well as to error counts of 6 experts and
preferences of 2 experts. Our method demonstrates not only higher correlation
with expert error counts, but simultaneously higher alignment with expert
preferences when compared to previous approaches."

##### **Enabling High-Sparsity Foundational Llama Models with Efficient Pretraining and Deployment**
2405.03594v1 by Abhinav Agarwalla,Abhay Gupta,Alexandre Marques,Shubhra Pandit,Michael Goin,Eldar Kurtic,Kevin Leong,Tuan Nguyen,Mahmoud Salem,Dan Alistarh,Sean Lie,Mark Kurtz

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP), but their size creates computational bottlenecks. We introduce a novel
approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs
that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70%
sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT
one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of
the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We
exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that
closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference
acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine
and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are
realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use
of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for
sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results
across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code
generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality.
This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without
sacrificing accuracy.

##### **Deep Space Separable Distillation for Lightweight Acoustic Scene Classification**
2405.03567v1 by ShuQi Ye,Yuan Tian

Acoustic scene classification (ASC) is highly important in the real world.
Recently, deep learning-based methods have been widely employed for acoustic
scene classification. However, these methods are currently not lightweight
enough as well as their performance is not satisfactory. To solve these
problems, we propose a deep space separable distillation network. Firstly, the
network performs high-low frequency decomposition on the log-mel spectrogram,
significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining model
performance. Secondly, we specially design three lightweight operators for ASC,
including Separable Convolution (SC), Orthonormal Separable Convolution (OSC),
and Separable Partial Convolution (SPC). These operators exhibit highly
efficient feature extraction capabilities in acoustic scene classification
tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a
performance gain of 9.8% compared to the currently popular deep learning
methods, while also having smaller parameter count and computational
complexity.

##### **AlphaMath Almost Zero: process Supervision without process**
2405.03553v1 by Guoxin Chen,Minpeng Liao,Chengxi Li,Kai Fan

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
enhanced their mathematical reasoning abilities. However, these models still
struggle with complex problems that require multiple reasoning steps,
frequently leading to logical or numerical errors. While numerical mistakes can
largely be addressed by integrating a code interpreter, identifying logical
errors within intermediate steps is more challenging. Moreover, manually
annotating these steps for training is not only expensive but also demands
specialized expertise. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that
eliminates the need for manual annotation by leveraging the Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) framework to generate both the process supervision and evaluation
signals automatically. Essentially, when a LLM is well pre-trained, only the
mathematical questions and their final answers are required to generate our
training data, without requiring the solutions. We proceed to train a
step-level value model designed to improve the LLM's inference process in
mathematical domains. Our experiments indicate that using automatically
generated solutions by LLMs enhanced with MCTS significantly improves the
model's proficiency in dealing with intricate mathematical reasoning tasks.

##### **MAmmoTH2: Scaling Instructions from the Web**
2405.03548v1 by Xiang Yue,Tuney Zheng,Ge Zhang,Wenhu Chen

Instruction tuning improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), with data quality and scalability being the crucial factors. Most
instruction tuning data come from human crowd-sourcing or GPT-4 distillation.
We propose a paradigm to efficiently harvest 10 million naturally existing
instruction data from the pre-training web corpus to enhance LLM reasoning. Our
approach involves (1) recalling relevant documents, (2) extracting
instruction-response pairs, and (3) refining the extracted pairs using
open-source LLMs. Fine-tuning base LLMs on this dataset, we build MAmmoTH2
models, which significantly boost performance on reasoning benchmarks. Notably,
MAmmoTH2-7B's (Mistral) performance increases from 11% to 34% on MATH and from
36% to 67% on GSM8K without training on any in-domain data. Further training
MAmmoTH2 on public instruction tuning datasets yields MAmmoTH2-Plus, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on several reasoning and chatbot benchmarks. Our
work demonstrates how to harvest large-scale, high-quality instruction data
without costly human annotation or GPT-4 distillation, providing a new paradigm
for building better instruction tuning data.

##### **Position Paper: Leveraging Foundational Models for Black-Box Optimization: Benefits, Challenges, and Future Directions**
2405.03547v1 by Xingyou Song,Yingtao Tian,Robert Tjarko Lange,Chansoo Lee,Yujin Tang,Yutian Chen

Undeniably, Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred an extraordinary wave
of innovation in the machine learning research domain, resulting in substantial
impact across diverse fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, and
computer vision. Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking
a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research.
  However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box
optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though
integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for
exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box
optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their
relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways
foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include
harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to
enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as
Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing
performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.

##### **Exploring the Efficacy of Federated-Continual Learning Nodes with Attention-Based Classifier for Robust Web Phishing Detection: An Empirical Investigation**
2405.03537v1 by Jesher Joshua M,Adhithya R,Sree Dananjay S,M Revathi

Web phishing poses a dynamic threat, requiring detection systems to quickly
adapt to the latest tactics. Traditional approaches of accumulating data and
periodically retraining models are outpaced. We propose a novel paradigm
combining federated learning and continual learning, enabling distributed nodes
to continually update models on streams of new phishing data, without
accumulating data. These locally adapted models are then aggregated at a
central server via federated learning. To enhance detection, we introduce a
custom attention-based classifier model with residual connections, tailored for
web phishing, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture intricate phishing
patterns. We evaluate our hybrid learning paradigm across continual learning
strategies (cumulative, replay, MIR, LwF) and model architectures through an
empirical investigation. Our main contributions are: (1) a new hybrid
federated-continual learning paradigm for robust web phishing detection, and
(2) a novel attention + residual connections based model explicitly designed
for this task, attaining 0.93 accuracy, 0.90 precision, 0.96 recall and 0.93
f1-score with the LwF strategy, outperforming traditional approaches in
detecting emerging phishing threats while retaining past knowledge.

##### **A Rate-Distortion-Classification Approach for Lossy Image Compression**
2405.03500v1 by Yuefeng Zhang

In lossy image compression, the objective is to achieve minimal signal
distortion while compressing images to a specified bit rate. The increasing
demand for visual analysis applications, particularly in classification tasks,
has emphasized the significance of considering semantic distortion in
compressed images. To bridge the gap between image compression and visual
analysis, we propose a Rate-Distortion-Classification (RDC) model for lossy
image compression, offering a unified framework to optimize the trade-off
between rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The RDC model is
extensively analyzed both statistically on a multi-distribution source and
experimentally on the widely used MNIST dataset. The findings reveal that the
RDC model exhibits desirable properties, including monotonic non-increasing and
convex functions, under certain conditions. This work provides insights into
the development of human-machine friendly compression methods and Video Coding
for Machine (VCM) approaches, paving the way for end-to-end image compression
techniques in real-world applications.

##### **A Lightweight Neural Architecture Search Model for Medical Image Classification**
2405.03462v1 by Lunchen Xie,Eugenio Lomurno,Matteo Gambella,Danilo Ardagna,Manuel Roveri,Matteo Matteucci,Qingjiang Shi

Accurate classification of medical images is essential for modern
diagnostics. Deep learning advancements led clinicians to increasingly use
sophisticated models to make faster and more accurate decisions, sometimes
replacing human judgment. However, model development is costly and repetitive.
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides solutions by automating the design of
deep learning architectures. This paper presents ZO-DARTS+, a differentiable
NAS algorithm that improves search efficiency through a novel method of
generating sparse probabilities by bi-level optimization. Experiments on five
public medical datasets show that ZO-DARTS+ matches the accuracy of
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing search times by up to three times.

##### **Large Language Models (LLMs) as Agents for Augmented Democracy**
2405.03452v2 by Jairo Gudiño-Rosero,Umberto Grandi,César A. Hidalgo

We explore the capabilities of an augmented democracy system built on
off-the-shelf LLMs fine-tuned on data summarizing individual preferences across
67 policy proposals collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections.
We use a train-test cross-validation setup to estimate the accuracy with which
the LLMs predict both: a subject's individual political choices and the
aggregate preferences of the full sample of participants. At the individual
level, the accuracy of the out of sample predictions lie in the range 69%-76%
and are significantly better at predicting the preferences of liberal and
college educated participants. At the population level, we aggregate
preferences using an adaptation of the Borda score and compare the ranking of
policy proposals obtained from a probabilistic sample of participants and from
data augmented using LLMs. We find that the augmented data predicts the
preferences of the full population of participants better than probabilistic
samples alone when these represent less than 30% to 40% of the total
population. These results indicate that LLMs are potentially useful for the
construction of systems of augmented democracy.

##### **Robotic Constrained Imitation Learning for the Peg Transfer Task in Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery**
2405.03440v1 by Kento Kawaharazuka,Kei Okada,Masayuki Inaba

In this study, we present an implementation strategy for a robot that
performs peg transfer tasks in Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) via
imitation learning, aimed at the development of an autonomous robot for
laparoscopic surgery. Robotic laparoscopic surgery presents two main
challenges: (1) the need to manipulate forceps using ports established on the
body surface as fulcrums, and (2) difficulty in perceiving depth information
when working with a monocular camera that displays its images on a monitor.
Especially, regarding issue (2), most prior research has assumed the
availability of depth images or models of a target to be operated on.
Therefore, in this study, we achieve more accurate imitation learning with only
monocular images by extracting motion constraints from one exemplary motion of
skilled operators, collecting data based on these constraints, and conducting
imitation learning based on the collected data. We implemented an overall
system using two Franka Emika Panda Robot Arms and validated its effectiveness.

##### **A method for quantifying the generalization capabilities of generative models for solving Ising models**
2405.03435v1 by Qunlong Ma,Zhi Ma,Ming Gao

For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can
be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the
training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently
proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models,
there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization
capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of
a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to
quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures
combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between
the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which,
together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a
quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct
numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined
with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when
solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of
the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used
to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of
great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of
searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising
models.

##### **ReCycle: Fast and Efficient Long Time Series Forecasting with Residual Cyclic Transformers**
2405.03429v1 by Arvid Weyrauch,Thomas Steens,Oskar Taubert,Benedikt Hanke,Aslan Eqbal,Ewa Götz,Achim Streit,Markus Götz,Charlotte Debus

Transformers have recently gained prominence in long time series forecasting
by elevating accuracies in a variety of use cases. Regrettably, in the race for
better predictive performance the overhead of model architectures has grown
onerous, leading to models with computational demand infeasible for most
practical applications. To bridge the gap between high method complexity and
realistic computational resources, we introduce the Residual Cyclic
Transformer, ReCycle. ReCycle utilizes primary cycle compression to address the
computational complexity of the attention mechanism in long time series. By
learning residuals from refined smoothing average techniques, ReCycle surpasses
state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of application use cases. The reliable
and explainable fallback behavior ensured by simple, yet robust, smoothing
average techniques additionally lowers the barrier for user acceptance. At the
same time, our approach reduces the run time and energy consumption by more
than an order of magnitude, making both training and inference feasible on
low-performance, low-power and edge computing devices. Code is available at
https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/ReCycle

##### **Gaussian Stochastic Weight Averaging for Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models**
2405.03425v1 by Emre Onal,Klemens Flöge,Emma Caldwell,Arsen Sheverdin,Vincent Fortuin

Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence and
poor calibration, particularly when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
with Gaussian Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWAG), facilitating approximate
Bayesian inference in LLMs. Through extensive testing across several Natural
Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, we demonstrate that our straightforward
and computationally efficient approach improves model generalization and
calibration. We further show that our method exhibits greater robustness
against distribution shift, as reflected in its performance on
out-of-distribution tasks.

##### **Automated Computation of Therapies Using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in the Medical Domain**
2405.03406v1 by Malte Luttermann,Edgar Baake,Juljan Bouchagiar,Benjamin Gebel,Philipp Grüning,Dilini Manikwadura,Franziska Schollemann,Elisa Teifke,Philipp Rostalski,Ralf Möller

Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic approach to identify
and analyse potential failures and their effects in a system or process. The
FMEA approach, however, requires domain experts to manually analyse the FMEA
model to derive risk-reducing actions that should be applied. In this paper, we
provide a formal framework to allow for automatic planning and acting in FMEA
models. More specifically, we cast the FMEA model into a Markov decision
process which can then be solved by existing solvers. We show that the FMEA
approach can not only be used to support medical experts during the modelling
process but also to automatically derive optimal therapies for the treatment of
patients.

##### **E2GNN: Efficient Graph Neural Network Ensembles for Semi-Supervised Classification**
2405.03401v1 by Xin Zhang,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan

This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under
the popular semi-supervised setting. Ensemble learning has shown superiority in
improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by
combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar
idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons.
First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling
multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when
GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited.
In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be
sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions.
To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to
assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and
unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a
given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly
combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer
perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled
nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or
new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models
may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter
out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing
this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN
ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.
Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across
different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority
of E2GNN.

##### **Don't Waste Your Time: Early Stopping Cross-Validation**
2405.03389v1 by Edward Bergman,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter

State-of-the-art automated machine learning systems for tabular data often
employ cross-validation; ensuring that measured performances generalize to
unseen data, or that subsequent ensembling does not overfit. However, using
k-fold cross-validation instead of holdout validation drastically increases the
computational cost of validating a single configuration. While ensuring better
generalization and, by extension, better performance, the additional cost is
often prohibitive for effective model selection within a time budget. We aim to
make model selection with cross-validation more effective. Therefore, we study
early stopping the process of cross-validation during model selection. We
investigate the impact of early stopping on random search for two algorithms,
MLP and random forest, across 36 classification datasets. We further analyze
the impact of the number of folds by considering 3-, 5-, and 10-folds. In
addition, we investigate the impact of early stopping with Bayesian
optimization instead of random search and also repeated cross-validation. Our
exploratory study shows that even a simple-to-understand and easy-to-implement
method consistently allows model selection to converge faster; in ~94% of all
datasets, on average by ~214%. Moreover, stopping cross-validation enables
model selection to explore the search space more exhaustively by considering
+167% configurations on average within one hour, while also obtaining better
overall performance.

##### **The high dimensional psychological profile and cultural bias of ChatGPT**
2405.03387v1 by Hang Yuan,Zhongyue Che,Shao Li,Yue Zhang,Xiaomeng Hu,Siyang Luo

Given the rapid advancement of large-scale language models, artificial
intelligence (AI) models, like ChatGPT, are playing an increasingly prominent
role in human society. However, to ensure that artificial intelligence models
benefit human society, we must first fully understand the similarities and
differences between the human-like characteristics exhibited by artificial
intelligence models and real humans, as well as the cultural stereotypes and
biases that artificial intelligence models may exhibit in the process of
interacting with humans. This study first measured ChatGPT in 84 dimensions of
psychological characteristics, revealing differences between ChatGPT and human
norms in most dimensions as well as in high-dimensional psychological
representations. Additionally, through the measurement of ChatGPT in 13
dimensions of cultural values, it was revealed that ChatGPT's cultural value
patterns are dissimilar to those of various countries/regions worldwide.
Finally, an analysis of ChatGPT's performance in eight decision-making tasks
involving interactions with humans from different countries/regions revealed
that ChatGPT exhibits clear cultural stereotypes in most decision-making tasks
and shows significant cultural bias in third-party punishment and ultimatum
games. The findings indicate that, compared to humans, ChatGPT exhibits a
distinct psychological profile and cultural value orientation, and it also
shows cultural biases and stereotypes in interpersonal decision-making. Future
research endeavors should emphasize enhanced technical oversight and augmented
transparency in the database and algorithmic training procedures to foster more
efficient cross-cultural communication and mitigate social disparities.

##### **Snake Learning: A Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Learning Framework for 6G**
2405.03372v1 by Xiaoxue Yu,Xingfu Yi,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang

In the evolution towards 6G, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with
advanced network infrastructure emerges as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
network intelligence and resource utilization. Existing distributed learning
frameworks like Federated Learning and Split Learning often struggle with
significant challenges in dynamic network environments including high
synchronization demands, costly communication overheads, severe computing
resource consumption, and data heterogeneity across network nodes. These
obstacles hinder the applications of ubiquitous computing capabilities of 6G
networks, especially in light of the trend of escalating model parameters and
training data volumes. To address these challenges effectively, this paper
introduces "Snake Learning", a cost-effective distributed learning framework.
Specifically, Snake Learning respects the heterogeneity of inter-node computing
capability and local data distribution in 6G networks, and sequentially trains
the designated part of model layers on individual nodes. This layer-by-layer
serpentine update mechanism contributes to significantly reducing the
requirements for storage, memory and communication during the model training
phase, and demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency for both Computer
Vision (CV) training and Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning tasks across
homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.

##### **Explainable Fake News Detection With Large Language Model via Defense Among Competing Wisdom**
2405.03371v1 by Bo Wang,Jing Ma,Hongzhan Lin,Zhiwei Yang,Ruichao Yang,Yuan Tian,Yi Chang

Most fake news detection methods learn latent feature representations based
on neural networks, which makes them black boxes to classify a piece of news
without giving any justification. Existing explainable systems generate
veracity justifications from investigative journalism, which suffer from
debunking delayed and low efficiency. Recent studies simply assume that the
justification is equivalent to the majority opinions expressed in the wisdom of
crowds. However, the opinions typically contain some inaccurate or biased
information since the wisdom of crowds is uncensored. To detect fake news from
a sea of diverse, crowded and even competing narratives, in this paper, we
propose a novel defense-based explainable fake news detection framework.
Specifically, we first propose an evidence extraction module to split the
wisdom of crowds into two competing parties and respectively detect salient
evidences. To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a
prompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate
justifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally,
we propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling
the defense among these justifications. Extensive experiments conducted on two
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of fake news detection and provides
high-quality justifications.

##### **MedDoc-Bot: A Chat Tool for Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models in the Context of the Pediatric Hypertension Guideline**
2405.03359v1 by Mohamed Yaseen Jabarulla,Steffen Oeltze-Jafra,Philipp Beerbaum,Theodor Uden

This research focuses on evaluating the non-commercial open-source large
language models (LLMs) Meditron, MedAlpaca, Mistral, and Llama-2 for their
efficacy in interpreting medical guidelines saved in PDF format. As a specific
test scenario, we applied these models to the guidelines for hypertension in
children and adolescents provided by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
Leveraging Streamlit, a Python library, we developed a user-friendly medical
document chatbot tool (MedDoc-Bot). This tool enables authorized users to
upload PDF files and pose questions, generating interpretive responses from
four locally stored LLMs. A pediatric expert provides a benchmark for
evaluation by formulating questions and responses extracted from the ESC
guidelines. The expert rates the model-generated responses based on their
fidelity and relevance. Additionally, we evaluated the METEOR and chrF metric
scores to assess the similarity of model responses to reference answers. Our
study found that Llama-2 and Mistral performed well in metrics evaluation.
However, Llama-2 was slower when dealing with text and tabular data. In our
human evaluation, we observed that responses created by Mistral, Meditron, and
Llama-2 exhibited reasonable fidelity and relevance. This study provides
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for future
developments in medical document interpretation. Open-Source Code:

##### **Enhancing Q-Learning with Large Language Model Heuristics**
2405.03341v1 by Xiefeng Wu

Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making
tasks but requires extensive sampling for significant improvements. Although
reward shaping is a powerful technique for enhancing learning efficiency, it
can introduce biases that affect agent performance. Furthermore,
potential-based reward shaping is constrained as it does not allow for reward
modifications based on actions or terminal states, potentially limiting its
effectiveness in complex environments. Additionally, large language models
(LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning, but this is generally limited to simpler
tasks. They also exhibit low inference speeds and occasionally produce
hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided
Q-learning} that employs LLMs as heuristic to aid in learning the Q-function
for reinforcement learning. It combines the advantages of both technologies
without introducing performance bias. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates
that the LLM heuristic provides action-level guidance. Additionally, our
architecture has the capability to convert the impact of hallucinations into
exploration costs. Moreover, the converged Q function corresponds to the MDP
optimal Q function. Experiment results demonstrated that our algorithm enables
agents to avoid ineffective exploration, enhances sampling efficiency, and is
well-suited for complex control tasks.

##### **Functional Equivalence with NARS**
2405.03340v1 by Robert Johansson,Patrick Hammer,Tony Lofthouse

This study explores the concept of functional equivalence within the
framework of the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), specifically through
OpenNARS for Applications (ONA). Functional equivalence allows organisms to
categorize and respond to varied stimuli based on their utility rather than
perceptual similarity, thus enhancing cognitive efficiency and adaptability. In
this study, ONA was modified to allow the derivation of functional equivalence.
This paper provides practical examples of the capability of ONA to apply
learned knowledge across different functional situations, demonstrating its
utility in complex problem-solving and decision-making. An extended example is
included, where training of ONA aimed to learn basic human-like language
abilities, using a systematic procedure in relating spoken words, objects and
written words. The research carried out as part of this study extends the
understanding of functional equivalence in AGI systems, and argues for its
necessity for level of flexibility in learning and adapting necessary for
human-level AGI.

##### **Enhancing Spatiotemporal Disease Progression Models via Latent Diffusion and Prior Knowledge**
2405.03328v1 by Lemuel Puglisi,Daniel C. Alexander,Daniele Ravì

In this work, we introduce Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel
spatiotemporal disease progression model based on latent diffusion. BrLP is
designed to predict the evolution of diseases at the individual level on 3D
brain MRIs. Existing deep generative models developed for this task are
primarily data-driven and face challenges in learning disease progressions.
BrLP addresses these challenges by incorporating prior knowledge from disease
models to enhance the accuracy of predictions. To implement this, we propose to
integrate an auxiliary model that infers volumetric changes in various brain
regions. Additionally, we introduce Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), a novel
technique to improve spatiotemporal consistency of the predicted progression.
BrLP is trained and evaluated on a large dataset comprising 11,730 T1-weighted
brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects, collected from three publicly available,
longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease (AD) studies. In our experiments, we compare
the MRI scans generated by BrLP with the actual follow-up MRIs available from
the subjects, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal settings. BrLP
demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, with an increase
of 22% in volumetric accuracy across AD-related brain regions and 43% in image
similarity to the ground-truth scans. The ability of BrLP to generate
conditioned 3D scans at the subject level, along with the novelty of
integrating prior knowledge to enhance accuracy, represents a significant
advancement in disease progression modeling, opening new avenues for precision
medicine. The code of BrLP is available at the following link:

##### **Artificial Intelligence in the Autonomous Navigation of Endovascular Interventions: A Systematic Review**
2405.03305v1 by Harry Robertshaw,Lennart Karstensen,Benjamin Jackson,Hadi Sadati,Kawal Rhode,Sebastien Ourselin,Alejandro Granados,Thomas C Booth

Purpose: Autonomous navigation of devices in endovascular interventions can
decrease operation times, improve decision-making during surgery, and reduce
operator radiation exposure while increasing access to treatment. This
systematic review explores recent literature to assess the impact, challenges,
and opportunities artificial intelligence (AI) has for the autonomous
endovascular intervention navigation.
  Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried. Eligibility criteria
included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous
navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions. Following
PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2. PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.
  Results: Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria. Reinforcement
learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as
data-driven models for autonomous navigation. Studies predominantly utilised
physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models. Experiments
within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority
of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used
in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study.
We observed that risk of bias and poor generalisability were present across
studies. No procedures were performed on patients in any of the studies
reviewed. Studies lacked patient selection criteria, reference standards, and
reproducibility, resulting in low clinical evidence levels.
  Conclusions: AI's potential in autonomous endovascular navigation is
promising, but in an experimental proof-of-concept stage, with a technology
readiness level of 3. We highlight that reference standards with
well-identified performance metrics are crucial to allow for comparisons of
data-driven algorithms proposed in the years to come.

##### **Coefficient Decomposition for Spectral Graph Convolution**
2405.03296v1 by Feng Huang,Wen Zhang

Spectral graph convolutional network (SGCN) is a kind of graph neural
networks (GNN) based on graph signal filters, and has shown compelling
expressivity for modeling graph-structured data. Most SGCNs adopt polynomial
filters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus
on which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models'
architecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in
terms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis
are stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in
existing SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition
operation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop
novel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor
decomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable
performance improvements.

##### **Animate Your Thoughts: Decoupled Reconstruction of Dynamic Natural Vision from Slow Brain Activity**
2405.03280v1 by Yizhuo Lu,Changde Du,Chong Wang,Xuanliu Zhu,Liuyun Jiang,Huiguang He

Reconstructing human dynamic vision from brain activity is a challenging task
with great scientific significance. The difficulty stems from two primary
issues: (1) vision-processing mechanisms in the brain are highly intricate and
not fully revealed, making it challenging to directly learn a mapping between
fMRI and video; (2) the temporal resolution of fMRI is significantly lower than
that of natural videos. To overcome these issues, this paper propose a
two-stage model named Mind-Animator, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance on three public datasets. Specifically, during the fMRI-to-feature
stage, we decouple semantic, structural, and motion features from fMRI through
fMRI-vision-language tri-modal contrastive learning and sparse causal
attention. In the feature-to-video stage, these features are merged to videos
by an inflated Stable Diffusion. We substantiate that the reconstructed video
dynamics are indeed derived from fMRI, rather than hallucinations of the
generative model, through permutation tests. Additionally, the visualization of
voxel-wise and ROI-wise importance maps confirms the neurobiological
interpretability of our model.

##### **Lifelong Knowledge Editing for LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Continuous Prompt Learning**
2405.03279v1 by Qizhou Chen,Taolin Zhang,Dongyang Li,Longtao Huang,Hui Xue,Chengyu Wang,Xiaofeng He

Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large
language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model
editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing
requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing;
nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to
catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance.
Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by
slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the
model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous
Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in
lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and
informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to
efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further
integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to
calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository
contains relevant knowledge. Our retriever and prompt encoder are jointly
trained to achieve editing properties, i.e., reliability, generality, and
locality. In our experiments, RECIPE is assessed extensively across multiple
LLMs and editing datasets, where it achieves superior editing performance.
RECIPE also demonstrates its capability to maintain the overall performance of
LLMs alongside showcasing fast editing and inference speed.

##### **Exploring the Frontiers of Softmax: Provable Optimization, Applications in Diffusion Model, and Beyond**
2405.03251v1 by Jiuxiang Gu,Chenyang Li,Yingyu Liang,Zhenmei Shi,Zhao Song

The softmax activation function plays a crucial role in the success of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the self-attention mechanism of the
widely adopted Transformer architecture. However, the underlying learning
dynamics that contribute to the effectiveness of softmax remain largely
unexplored. As a step towards better understanding, this paper provides a
theoretical study of the optimization and generalization properties of
two-layer softmax neural networks, providing theoretical insights into their
superior performance as other activation functions, such as ReLU and
exponential. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, our analysis
reveals that the normalization effect of the softmax function leads to a good
perturbation property of the induced NTK matrix, resulting in a good convex
region of the loss landscape. Consequently, softmax neural networks can learn
the target function in the over-parametrization regime. To demonstrate the
broad applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply them to the task of
learning score estimation functions in diffusion models, a promising approach
for generative modeling. Our analysis shows that gradient-based algorithms can
learn the score function with a provable accuracy. Our work provides a deeper
understanding of the effectiveness of softmax neural networks and their
potential in various domains, paving the way for further advancements in
natural language processing and beyond.

##### **Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Adaptive Compression under Dynamic Bandwidth**
2405.03248v1 by Ying Zhuansun,Dandan Li,Xiaohong Huang,Caijun Sun

Federated learning can train models without directly providing local data to
the server. However, the frequent updating of the local model brings the
problem of large communication overhead. Recently, scholars have achieved the
communication efficiency of federated learning mainly by model compression. But
they ignore two problems: 1) network state of each client changes dynamically;
2) network state among clients is not the same. The clients with poor bandwidth
update local model slowly, which leads to low efficiency. To address this
challenge, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning algorithm
with adaptive compression under dynamic bandwidth (called AdapComFL).
Concretely, each client performs bandwidth awareness and bandwidth prediction.
Then, each client adaptively compresses its local model via the improved sketch
mechanism based on his predicted bandwidth. Further, the server aggregates
sketched models with different sizes received. To verify the effectiveness of
the proposed method, the experiments are based on real bandwidth data which are
collected from the network topology we build, and benchmark datasets which are
obtained from open repositories. We show the performance of AdapComFL
algorithm, and compare it with existing algorithms. The experimental results
show that our AdapComFL achieves more efficient communication as well as
competitive accuracy compared to existing algorithms.

##### **Deep Learning for Detecting and Early Predicting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease from Spirogram Time Series: A UK Biobank Study**
2405.03239v1 by Shuhao Mei,Yuxi Zhou,Jiahao Xu,Yuxuan Wan,Shan Cao,Qinghao Zhao,Shijia Geng,Junqing Xie,Shenda Hong

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung
condition that causes airflow obstruction. The existing methods can only detect
patients who already have COPD based on obvious features shown in the spirogram
(In this article, the spirogram specifically involves measuring Volume-Flow
curve time series). Early prediction of COPD risk is vital for monitoring COPD
disease progression, slowing it down, or even preventing its onset. However,
these methods fail to early predict an individual's probability of COPD in the
future based on subtle features in the spirogram. To address this gap, for the
first time, we propose DeepSpiro, a method based on deep learning for early
prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four parts. First, we
construct Volume-Flow curves guided by Time-Volume instability smoothing
(SpiroSmoother) to enhance the stability of the original Volume-Flow curves
precisely. Second, we extract critical features from the evolution of
varied-length key patches (SpiroEncoder) to capture the key temporal evolution
from original high-dimensional dynamic sequences to a unified low-dimensional
temporal representation. Third, we explain the model based on temporal
attention and heterogeneous feature fusion (SpiroExplainer), which integrates
information from heterogeneous data such as spirogram and demographic
information. Fourth, we predict the risk of COPD based on the evolution of key
patch concavity (SpiroPredictor), enabling accurate prediction of the risk of
disease in high-risk patients who are not yet diagnosed, for up to 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 years, and beyond. We conduct experiments on the UK Biobank dataset. Results
show that DeepSpiro achieves an AUC value of 0.8328 in the task of detecting
COPD. In early prediction tasks, high-risk and low-risk groups show significant
differences in the future, with a p-value of <0.001.

##### **A Philosophical Introduction to Language Models - Part II: The Way Forward**
2405.03207v1 by Raphaël Millière,Cameron Buckner

In this paper, the second of two companion pieces, we explore novel
philosophical questions raised by recent progress in large language models
(LLMs) that go beyond the classical debates covered in the first part. We focus
particularly on issues related to interpretability, examining evidence from
causal intervention methods about the nature of LLMs' internal representations
and computations. We also discuss the implications of multimodal and modular
extensions of LLMs, recent debates about whether such systems may meet minimal
criteria for consciousness, and concerns about secrecy and reproducibility in
LLM research. Finally, we discuss whether LLM-like systems may be relevant to
modeling aspects of human cognition, if their architectural characteristics and
learning scenario are adequately constrained.

2405.03206v1 by Quang-Dan Tran,Van-Quan Nguyen,Quang-Huy Pham,K. B. Thang Nguyen,Trong-Hop Do

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integrated into our
daily lives, serving as invaluable assistants in completing tasks. Widely
embraced by users, the abuse of LLMs is inevitable, particularly in using them
to generate text content for various purposes, leading to difficulties in
distinguishing between text generated by LLMs and that written by humans. In
this study, we present a dataset named ViDetect, comprising 6.800 samples of
Vietnamese essay, with 3.400 samples authored by humans and the remainder
generated by LLMs, serving the purpose of detecting text generated by AI. We
conducted evaluations using state-of-the-art methods, including ViT5, BartPho,
PhoBERT, mDeberta V3, and mBERT. These results contribute not only to the
growing body of research on detecting text generated by AI but also demonstrate
the adaptability and effectiveness of different methods in the Vietnamese
language context. This research lays the foundation for future advancements in
AI-generated text detection and provides valuable insights for researchers in
the field of natural language processing.

##### **Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions**
2405.03205v1 by Ruizhe Li,Yanjun Gao

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have
demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including
multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional
bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they
consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This
anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as
it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the
choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability
approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for
this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention
heads, using the "logit lens" method to trace and modify the specific value
vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and
recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first
choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not
only correct the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for
the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first
comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias in MCQs within the GPT-2
models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that
significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/Anchored_Bias_GPT2.

##### **QuadraNet V2: Efficient and Sustainable Training of High-Order Neural Networks with Quadratic Adaptation**
2405.03192v1 by Chenhui Xu,Xinyao Wang,Fuxun Yu,JInjun Xiong,Xiang Chen

Machine learning is evolving towards high-order models that necessitate
pre-training on extensive datasets, a process associated with significant
overheads. Traditional models, despite having pre-trained weights, are becoming
obsolete due to architectural differences that obstruct the effective transfer
and initialization of these weights. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel framework, QuadraNet V2, which leverages quadratic neural networks to
create efficient and sustainable high-order learning models. Our method
initializes the primary term of the quadratic neuron using a standard neural
network, while the quadratic term is employed to adaptively enhance the
learning of data non-linearity or shifts. This integration of pre-trained
primary terms with quadratic terms, which possess advanced modeling
capabilities, significantly augments the information characterization capacity
of the high-order network. By utilizing existing pre-trained weights, QuadraNet
V2 reduces the required GPU hours for training by 90\% to 98.4\% compared to
training from scratch, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.

types of checkers are presented. The first type of checker follows the idea of
property testing. The second type of checker follows the idea of program
checking. Their applications are demonstrated in two separate contexts, entity
extraction and paraphrase decision, respectively.

Ali Eslami,Daniel Tse,Shruthi Prabhakara,Cory McLean,Dave Steiner,Rory Pilgrim,Christopher Kelly,Shekoofeh Azizi,Daniel Golden

Many clinical tasks require an understanding of specialized data, such as
medical images and genomics, which is not typically found in general-purpose
large multimodal models. Building upon Gemini's multimodal models, we develop
several models within the new Med-Gemini family that inherit core capabilities
of Gemini and are optimized for medical use via fine-tuning with 2D and 3D
radiology, histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology and genomic data.
Med-Gemini-2D sets a new standard for AI-based chest X-ray (CXR) report
generation based on expert evaluation, exceeding previous best results across
two separate datasets by an absolute margin of 1% and 12%, where 57% and 96% of
AI reports on normal cases, and 43% and 65% on abnormal cases, are evaluated as
"equivalent or better" than the original radiologists' reports. We demonstrate
the first ever large multimodal model-based report generation for 3D computed
tomography (CT) volumes using Med-Gemini-3D, with 53% of AI reports considered
clinically acceptable, although additional research is needed to meet expert
radiologist reporting quality. Beyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D
surpasses the previous best performance in CXR visual question answering (VQA)
and performs well in CXR classification and radiology VQA, exceeding SoTA or
baselines on 17 of 20 tasks. In histopathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology
image classification, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses baselines across 18 out of 20
tasks and approaches task-specific model performance. Beyond imaging,
Med-Gemini-Polygenic outperforms the standard linear polygenic risk score-based
approach for disease risk prediction and generalizes to genetically correlated
diseases for which it has never been trained. Although further development and
evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical medical domain, our results
highlight the potential of Med-Gemini across a wide range of medical tasks.

##### **Exploring the Potential of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in Identifying Misleading News Headlines**
2405.03153v1 by Md Main Uddin Rony,Md Mahfuzul Haque,Mohammad Ali,Ahmed Shatil Alam,Naeemul Hassan

In the digital age, the prevalence of misleading news headlines poses a
significant challenge to information integrity, necessitating robust detection
mechanisms. This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
identifying misleading versus non-misleading news headlines. Utilizing a
dataset of 60 articles, sourced from both reputable and questionable outlets
across health, science & tech, and business domains, we employ three LLMs-
ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini-for classification. Our analysis reveals
significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating
superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on
misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered
evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of
misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human
judgment. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI ethics, emphasizing
the need for models that are not only technically advanced but also ethically
aligned and sensitive to the subtleties of human interpretation.

##### **Time Series Stock Price Forecasting Based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) Optimization**
2405.03151v1 by Xinye Sha

In this paper, a time series algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and
Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) optimization is used to forecast stock
prices effectively, taking into account the trend of the big data era. The data
are first analyzed by descriptive statistics, and then the model is built and
trained and tested on the dataset. After optimization and adjustment, the mean
absolute error (MAE) of the model gradually decreases from 0.11 to 0.01 and
tends to be stable, indicating that the model prediction effect is gradually
close to the real value. The results on the test set show that the time series
algorithm optimized based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory
Network (LSTM) is able to accurately predict the stock prices, and is highly
consistent with the actual price trends and values, with strong generalization
ability. The MAE on the test set is 2.41, the MSE is 9.84, the RMSE is 3.13,
and the R2 is 0.87. This research result not only provides a novel stock price
prediction method, but also provides a useful reference for financial market
analysis using computer technology and big data.

##### **Quantifying the Capabilities of LLMs across Scale and Precision**
2405.03146v1 by Sher Badshah,Hassan Sajjad

Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the
performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters.
One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational
requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in
resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these
limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of
Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these
approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on
model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a
comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and
quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of
open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.
Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural
language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination
reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts,
suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We
found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and
can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and
they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision
under similar memory requirements.

##### **Automatic Ultrasound Curve Angle Measurement via Affinity Clustering for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Evaluation**
2405.03141v2 by Yihao Zhou,Timothy Tin-Yan Lee,Kelly Ka-Lee Lai,Chonglin Wu,Hin Ting Lau,De Yang,Chui-Yi Chan,Winnie Chiu-Wing Chu,Jack Chun-Yiu Cheng,Tsz-Ping Lam,Yong-Ping Zheng

The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However,
the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge
due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been
validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis
assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out
manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic
system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this
end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle
(UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate
landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An
affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area
to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks.
Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered
affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for
UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for
landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic
UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can
potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.

##### **CRAFT: Extracting and Tuning Cultural Instructions from the Wild**
2405.03138v1 by Bin Wang,Geyu Lin,Zhengyuan Liu,Chengwei Wei,Nancy F. Chen

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved as the foundation of
various natural language processing (NLP) applications. Despite their wide use
cases, their understanding of culturally-related concepts and reasoning remains
limited. Meantime, there is a significant need to enhance these models'
cultural reasoning capabilities, especially concerning underrepresented
regions. This paper introduces a novel pipeline for extracting high-quality,
culturally-related instruction tuning datasets from vast unstructured corpora.
We utilize a self-instruction generation pipeline to identify cultural concepts
and trigger instruction. By integrating with a general-purpose instruction
tuning dataset, our model demonstrates enhanced capabilities in recognizing and
understanding regional cultural nuances, thereby enhancing its reasoning
capabilities. We conduct experiments across three regions: Singapore, the
Philippines, and the United States, achieving performance improvement of up to
6%. Our research opens new avenues for extracting cultural instruction tuning
sets directly from unstructured data, setting a precedent for future
innovations in the field.

##### **Lory: Fully Differentiable Mixture-of-Experts for Autoregressive Language Model Pre-training**
2405.03133v1 by Zexuan Zhong,Mengzhou Xia,Danqi Chen,Mike Lewis

Mixture-of-experts (MoE) models facilitate efficient scaling; however,
training the router network introduces the challenge of optimizing a
non-differentiable, discrete objective. Recently, a fully-differentiable MoE
architecture, SMEAR, was proposed (Muqeeth et al., 2023), which softly merges
experts in the parameter space; nevertheless, its effectiveness was only
demonstrated in downstream fine-tuning on classification tasks. In this paper,
we present Lory, the first approach that scales such architectures to
autoregressive language model pre-training. Lory introduces two key techniques:
(1) a causal segment routing strategy that achieves high efficiency for expert
merging operations while preserving the autoregressive nature of language
models; (2) a similarity-based data batching method that encourages expert
specialization by grouping similar documents in training instances. We
pre-train a series of Lory models on 150B tokens from scratch, with up to 32
experts and 30B (1.5B active) parameters. Experimental results show significant
performance gains over parameter-matched dense models on both perplexity
(+13.9%) and a variety of downstream tasks (+1.5%-11.1%). Despite segment-level
routing, Lory models achieve competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art MoE models with token-level routing. We further demonstrate
that the trained experts in Lory capture domain-level specialization without
supervision. Our work highlights the potential of fully-differentiable MoE
architectures for language model pre-training and advocates future research in
this area.

##### **WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Large Language Models with Mixture of Experts**
2405.03131v1 by Nan Xue,Yaping Sun,Zhiyong Chen,Meixia Tao,Xiaodong Xu,Liang Qian,Shuguang Cui,Ping Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various
natural language processing tasks, but how wireless communications can support
LLMs has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we propose a wireless
distributed LLMs paradigm based on Mixture of Experts (MoE), named WDMoE,
deploying LLMs collaboratively across edge servers of base station (BS) and
mobile devices in the wireless communications system. Specifically, we
decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by deploying the gating network and the
preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks
across the devices. This arrangement leverages the parallel capabilities of
expert networks on distributed devices. Moreover, to overcome the instability
of wireless communications, we design an expert selection policy by taking into
account both the performance of the model and the end-to-end latency, which
includes both transmission delay and inference delay. Evaluations conducted
across various LLMs and multiple datasets demonstrate that WDMoE not only
outperforms existing models, such as Llama 2 with 70 billion parameters, but
also significantly reduces end-to-end latency.

##### **AniTalker: Animate Vivid and Diverse Talking Faces through Identity-Decoupled Facial Motion Encoding**
2405.03121v1 by Tao Liu,Feilong Chen,Shuai Fan,Chenpeng Du,Qi Chen,Xie Chen,Kai Yu

The paper introduces AniTalker, an innovative framework designed to generate
lifelike talking faces from a single portrait. Unlike existing models that
primarily focus on verbal cues such as lip synchronization and fail to capture
the complex dynamics of facial expressions and nonverbal cues, AniTalker
employs a universal motion representation. This innovative representation
effectively captures a wide range of facial dynamics, including subtle
expressions and head movements. AniTalker enhances motion depiction through two
self-supervised learning strategies: the first involves reconstructing target
video frames from source frames within the same identity to learn subtle motion
representations, and the second develops an identity encoder using metric
learning while actively minimizing mutual information between the identity and
motion encoders. This approach ensures that the motion representation is
dynamic and devoid of identity-specific details, significantly reducing the
need for labeled data. Additionally, the integration of a diffusion model with
a variance adapter allows for the generation of diverse and controllable facial
animations. This method not only demonstrates AniTalker's capability to create
detailed and realistic facial movements but also underscores its potential in
crafting dynamic avatars for real-world applications. Synthetic results can be
viewed at https://github.com/X-LANCE/AniTalker.

In this paper, we propose modelling human translation production as a

replicates the temporal dynamics of keystroke production across sensorimotor,

##### **FairMonitor: A Dual-framework for Detecting Stereotypes and Biases in Large Language Models**
2405.03098v1 by Yanhong Bai,Jiabao Zhao,Jinxin Shi,Zhentao Xie,Xingjiao Wu,Liang He

Detecting stereotypes and biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial
for enhancing fairness and reducing adverse impacts on individuals or groups
when these models are applied. Traditional methods, which rely on embedding
spaces or are based on probability metrics, fall short in revealing the nuanced
and implicit biases present in various contexts. To address this challenge, we
propose the FairMonitor framework and adopt a static-dynamic detection method
for a comprehensive evaluation of stereotypes and biases in LLMs. The static
component consists of a direct inquiry test, an implicit association test, and
an unknown situation test, including 10,262 open-ended questions with 9
sensitive factors and 26 educational scenarios. And it is effective for
evaluating both explicit and implicit biases. Moreover, we utilize the
multi-agent system to construst the dynamic scenarios for detecting subtle
biases in more complex and realistic setting. This component detects the biases
based on the interaction behaviors of LLMs across 600 varied educational
scenarios. The experimental results show that the cooperation of static and
dynamic methods can detect more stereotypes and biased in LLMs.

##### **To Each (Textual Sequence) Its Own: Improving Memorized-Data Unlearning in Large Language Models**
2405.03097v1 by George-Octavian Barbulescu,Peter Triantafillou

LLMs have been found to memorize training textual sequences and regurgitate
verbatim said sequences during text generation time. This fact is known to be
the cause of privacy and related (e.g., copyright) problems. Unlearning in LLMs
then takes the form of devising new algorithms that will properly deal with
these side-effects of memorized data, while not hurting the model's utility. We
offer a fresh perspective towards this goal, namely, that each textual sequence
to be forgotten should be treated differently when being unlearned based on its
degree of memorization within the LLM. We contribute a new metric for measuring
unlearning quality, an adversarial attack showing that SOTA algorithms lacking
this perspective fail for privacy, and two new unlearning methods based on
Gradient Ascent and Task Arithmetic, respectively. A comprehensive performance
evaluation across an extensive suite of NLP tasks then mapped the solution
space, identifying the best solutions under different scales in model
capacities and forget set sizes and quantified the gains of the new approaches.

##### **Compressing Long Context for Enhancing RAG with AMR-based Concept Distillation**
2405.03085v1 by Kaize Shi,Xueyao Sun,Qing Li,Guandong Xu

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in information
acquisition. However, their overreliance on potentially flawed parametric
knowledge leads to hallucinations and inaccuracies, particularly when handling
long-tail, domain-specific queries. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external, non-parametric knowledge.
Nevertheless, the retrieved long-context documents often contain noisy,
irrelevant information alongside vital knowledge, negatively diluting LLMs'
attention. Inspired by the supportive role of essential concepts in
individuals' reading comprehension, we propose a novel concept-based RAG
framework with the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)-based concept
distillation algorithm. The proposed algorithm compresses the cluttered raw
retrieved documents into a compact set of crucial concepts distilled from the
informative nodes of AMR by referring to reliable linguistic features. The
concepts explicitly constrain LLMs to focus solely on vital information in the
inference process. We conduct extensive experiments on open-domain
question-answering datasets to empirically evaluate the proposed method's
effectiveness. The results indicate that the concept-based RAG framework
outperforms other baseline methods, particularly as the number of supporting
documents increases, while also exhibiting robustness across various backbone
LLMs. This emphasizes the distilled concepts are informative for augmenting the
RAG process by filtering out interference information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR to enhance the RAG,
presenting a potential solution to augment inference performance with
semantic-based context compression.

##### **On Probabilistic and Causal Reasoning with Summation Operators**
2405.03069v1 by Duligur Ibeling,Thomas F. Icard,Milan Mossé

Ibeling et al. (2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of
causation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning
(specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as
difficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its
merely probabilistic or "correlational" counterpart. Introducing a summation
operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the
$do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of
marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier
complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization.
We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of
probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these
again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for
random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the
ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these
languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving
open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023).

##### **AC-MAMBASEG: An adaptive convolution and Mamba-based architecture for enhanced skin lesion segmentation**
2405.03011v1 by Viet-Thanh Nguyen,Van-Truong Pham,Thi-Thao Tran

Skin lesion segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis
systems for dermatological diseases. Accurate segmentation of skin lesions from
medical images is essential for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment
planning. In this paper, we propose a new model for skin lesion segmentation
namely AC-MambaSeg, an enhanced model that has the hybrid CNN-Mamba backbone,
and integrates advanced components such as Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM), Attention Gate, and Selective Kernel Bottleneck. AC-MambaSeg leverages
the Vision Mamba framework for efficient feature extraction, while CBAM and
Selective Kernel Bottleneck enhance its ability to focus on informative regions
and suppress background noise. We evaluate the performance of AC-MambaSeg on
diverse datasets of skin lesion images including ISIC-2018 and PH2; then
compare it against existing segmentation methods. Our model shows promising
potential for improving computer-aided diagnosis systems and facilitating early
detection and treatment of dermatological diseases. Our source code will be
made available at: https://github.com/vietthanh2710/AC-MambaSeg.

##### **High Order Reasoning for Time Critical Recommendation in Evidence-based Medicine**
2405.03010v1 by Manjiang Yu,Xue Li

In time-critical decisions, human decision-makers can interact with
AI-enabled situation-aware software to evaluate many imminent and possible
scenarios, retrieve billions of facts, and estimate different outcomes based on
trillions of parameters in a fraction of a second. In high-order reasoning,
"what-if" questions can be used to challenge the assumptions or pre-conditions
of the reasoning, "why-not" questions can be used to challenge on the method
applied in the reasoning, "so-what" questions can be used to challenge the
purpose of the decision, and "how-about" questions can be used to challenge the
applicability of the method. When above high-order reasoning questions are
applied to assist human decision-making, it can help humans to make
time-critical decisions and avoid false-negative or false-positive types of
errors. In this paper, we present a model of high-order reasoning to offer
recommendations in evidence-based medicine in a time-critical fashion for the
applications in ICU. The Large Language Model (LLM) is used in our system. The
experiments demonstrated the LLM exhibited optimal performance in the "What-if"
scenario, achieving a similarity of 88.52% with the treatment plans of human
doctors. In the "Why-not" scenario, the best-performing model tended to opt for
alternative treatment plans in 70% of cases for patients who died after being
discharged from the ICU. In the "So-what" scenario, the optimal model provided
a detailed analysis of the motivation and significance of treatment plans for
ICU patients, with its reasoning achieving a similarity of 55.6% with actual
diagnostic information. In the "How-about" scenario, the top-performing LLM
demonstrated a content similarity of 66.5% in designing treatment plans
transferring for similar diseases. Meanwhile, LLMs managed to predict the life
status of patients after their discharge from the ICU with an accuracy of 70%.

##### **Explainable Malware Detection with Tailored Logic Explained Networks**
2405.03009v1 by Peter Anthony,Francesco Giannini,Michelangelo Diligenti,Martin Homola,Marco Gori,Stefan Balogh,Jan Mojzis

Malware detection is a constant challenge in cybersecurity due to the rapid
development of new attack techniques. Traditional signature-based approaches
struggle to keep pace with the sheer volume of malware samples. Machine
learning offers a promising solution, but faces issues of generalization to
unseen samples and a lack of explanation for the instances identified as
malware. However, human-understandable explanations are especially important in
security-critical fields, where understanding model decisions is crucial for
trust and legal compliance. While deep learning models excel at malware
detection, their black-box nature hinders explainability. Conversely,
interpretable models often fall short in performance. To bridge this gap in
this application domain, we propose the use of Logic Explained Networks (LENs),
which are a recently proposed class of interpretable neural networks providing
explanations in the form of First-Order Logic (FOL) rules. This paper extends
the application of LENs to the complex domain of malware detection,
specifically using the large-scale EMBER dataset. In the experimental results
we show that LENs achieve robustness that exceeds traditional interpretable
methods and that are rivaling black-box models. Moreover, we introduce a
tailored version of LENs that is shown to generate logic explanations with
higher fidelity with respect to the model's predictions.

##### **On the performativity of SDG classifications in large bibliometric databases**
2405.03007v1 by Matteo Ottaviani,Stephan Stahlschmidt

Large bibliometric databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex,
facilitate bibliometric analyses, but are performative, affecting the
visibility of scientific outputs and the impact measurement of participating
entities. Recently, these databases have taken up the UN's Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) in their respective classifications, which have been
criticised for their diverging nature. This work proposes using the feature of
large language models (LLMs) to learn about the "data bias" injected by diverse
SDG classifications into bibliometric data by exploring five SDGs. We build a
LLM that is fine-tuned in parallel by the diverse SDG classifications inscribed
into the databases' SDG classifications. Our results show high sensitivity in
model architecture, classified publications, fine-tuning process, and natural
language generation. The wide arbitrariness at different levels raises concerns
about using LLM in research practice.

##### **Safe Reinforcement Learning with Learned Non-Markovian Safety Constraints**
2405.03005v1 by Siow Meng Low,Akshat Kumar

In safe Reinforcement Learning (RL), safety cost is typically defined as a
function dependent on the immediate state and actions. In practice, safety
constraints can often be non-Markovian due to the insufficient fidelity of
state representation, and safety cost may not be known. We therefore address a
general setting where safety labels (e.g., safe or unsafe) are associated with
state-action trajectories. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety
model that specifically performs credit assignment to assess contributions of
partial state-action trajectories on safety. This safety model is trained using
a labeled safety dataset. Second, using RL-as-inference strategy we derive an
effective algorithm for optimizing a safe policy using the learned safety
model. Finally, we devise a method to dynamically adapt the tradeoff
coefficient between reward maximization and safety compliance. We rewrite the
constrained optimization problem into its dual problem and derive a
gradient-based method to dynamically adjust the tradeoff coefficient during
training. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach is highly
scalable and able to satisfy sophisticated non-Markovian safety constraints.

##### **Exploring prompts to elicit memorization in masked language model-based named entity recognition**
2405.03004v1 by Yuxi Xia,Anastasiia Sedova,Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo,Vasiliki Kougia,Lisa Nußbaumer,Benjamin Roth

Training data memorization in language models impacts model capability
(generalization) and safety (privacy risk). This paper focuses on analyzing
prompts' impact on detecting the memorization of 6 masked language model-based
named entity recognition models. Specifically, we employ a diverse set of 400
automatically generated prompts, and a pairwise dataset where each pair
consists of one person's name from the training set and another name out of the
set. A prompt completed with a person's name serves as input for getting the
model's confidence in predicting this name. Finally, the prompt performance of
detecting model memorization is quantified by the percentage of name pairs for
which the model has higher confidence for the name from the training set. We
show that the performance of different prompts varies by as much as 16
percentage points on the same model, and prompt engineering further increases
the gap. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that prompt performance is
model-dependent but does generalize across different name sets. A comprehensive
analysis indicates how prompt performance is influenced by prompt properties,
contained tokens, and the model's self-attention weights on the prompt.

##### **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Discrete Fourier Transform**
2405.03003v1 by Ziqi Gao,Qichao Wang,Aochuan Chen,Zijing Liu,Bingzhe Wu,Liang Chen,Jia Li

Low-rank adaptation~(LoRA) has recently gained much interest in fine-tuning
foundation models. It effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters by
incorporating low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$ to represent the weight change,
i.e., $\Delta W=BA$. Despite LoRA's progress, it faces storage challenges when
handling extensive customization adaptations or larger base models. In this
work, we aim to further compress trainable parameters by enjoying the powerful
expressiveness of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we introduce FourierFT,
which treats $\Delta W$ as a matrix in the spatial domain and learns only a
small fraction of its spectral coefficients. With the trained spectral
coefficients, we implement the inverse discrete Fourier transform to recover
$\Delta W$. Empirically, our FourierFT method shows comparable or better
performance with fewer parameters than LoRA on various tasks, including natural
language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and
image classification. For example, when performing instruction tuning on the
LLaMA2-7B model, FourierFT surpasses LoRA with only 0.064M trainable
parameters, compared to LoRA's 33.5M. Our code is released at
\url{https://github.com/Chaos96/fourierft}.

##### **MedAdapter: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation of Large Language Models towards Medical Reasoning**
2405.03000v1 by Wenqi Shi,Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Yue Yu,Hang Wu,Carl Yang,May D. Wang

Despite their improved capabilities in generation and reasoning, adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the biomedical domain remains challenging due
to their immense size and corporate privacy. In this work, we propose
MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards
biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter
effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized
adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate
that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in
biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and
11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or
sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance
when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and
complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the
challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data
privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective,
and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.

##### **RepAugment: Input-Agnostic Representation-Level Augmentation for Respiratory Sound Classification**
2405.02996v1 by June-Woo Kim,Miika Toikkanen,Sangmin Bae,Minseok Kim,Ho-Young Jung

Recent advancements in AI have democratized its deployment as a healthcare
assistant. While pretrained models from large-scale visual and audio datasets
have demonstrably generalized to this task, surprisingly, no studies have
explored pretrained speech models, which, as human-originated sounds,
intuitively would share closer resemblance to lung sounds. This paper explores
the efficacy of pretrained speech models for respiratory sound classification.
We find that there is a characterization gap between speech and lung sound
samples, and to bridge this gap, data augmentation is essential. However, the
most widely used augmentation technique for audio and speech, SpecAugment,
requires 2-dimensional spectrogram format and cannot be applied to models
pretrained on speech waveforms. To address this, we propose RepAugment, an
input-agnostic representation-level augmentation technique that outperforms
SpecAugment, but is also suitable for respiratory sound classification with
waveform pretrained models. Experimental results show that our approach
outperforms the SpecAugment, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the
accuracy of minority disease classes, reaching up to 7.14%.

##### **Can Large Language Models Make the Grade? An Empirical Study Evaluating LLMs Ability to Mark Short Answer Questions in K-12 Education**
2405.02985v1 by Owen Henkel,Adam Boxer,Libby Hills,Bill Roberts

This paper presents reports on a series of experiments with a novel dataset
evaluating how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can mark (i.e. grade) open
text responses to short answer questions, Specifically, we explore how well
different combinations of GPT version and prompt engineering strategies
performed at marking real student answers to short answer across different
domain areas (Science and History) and grade-levels (spanning ages 5-16) using
a new, never-used-before dataset from Carousel, a quizzing platform. We found
that GPT-4, with basic few-shot prompting performed well (Kappa, 0.70) and,
importantly, very close to human-level performance (0.75). This research builds
on prior findings that GPT-4 could reliably score short answer reading
comprehension questions at a performance-level very close to that of expert
human raters. The proximity to human-level performance, across a variety of
subjects and grade levels suggests that LLMs could be a valuable tool for
supporting low-stakes formative assessment tasks in K-12 education and has
important implications for real-world education delivery.

##### **E-TSL: A Continuous Educational Turkish Sign Language Dataset with Baseline Methods**
2405.02984v1 by Şükrü Öztürk,Hacer Yalim Keles

This study introduces the continuous Educational Turkish Sign Language
(E-TSL) dataset, collected from online Turkish language lessons for 5th, 6th,
and 8th grades. The dataset comprises 1,410 videos totaling nearly 24 hours and
includes performances from 11 signers. Turkish, an agglutinative language,
poses unique challenges for sign language translation, particularly with a
vocabulary where 64% are singleton words and 85% are rare words, appearing less
than five times. We developed two baseline models to address these challenges:
the Pose to Text Transformer (P2T-T) and the Graph Neural Network based
Transformer (GNN-T) models. The GNN-T model achieved 19.13% BLEU-1 score and
3.28% BLEU-4 score, presenting a significant challenge compared to existing
benchmarks. The P2T-T model, while demonstrating slightly lower performance in
BLEU scores, achieved a higher ROUGE-L score of 22.09%. Additionally, we
benchmarked our model using the well-known PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset to
validate our approach.

##### **Multi-Agent RL-Based Industrial AIGC Service Offloading over Wireless Edge Networks**
2405.02972v1 by Siyuan Li,Xi Lin,Hansong Xu,Kun Hua,Xiaomin Jin,Gaolei Li,Jianhua Li

Currently, the generative model has garnered considerable attention due to
its application in addressing the challenge of scarcity of abnormal samples in
the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, challenges persist regarding
the edge deployment of generative models and the optimization of joint edge
AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks. In this paper, we focus on the edge
optimization of AIGC task execution and propose GMEL, a generative model-driven
industrial AIGC collaborative edge learning framework. This framework aims to
facilitate efficient few-shot learning by leveraging realistic sample synthesis
and edge-based optimization capabilities. First, a multi-task AIGC
computational offloading model is presented to ensure the efficient execution
of heterogeneous AIGC tasks on edge servers. Then, we propose an
attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) algorithm aimed
at refining offloading policies within the IoT system, thereby supporting
generative model-driven edge learning. Finally, our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing the total
system latency of the edge-based AIGC task completion.

##### **Agent Hospital: A Simulacrum of Hospital with Evolvable Medical Agents**
2405.02957v1 by Junkai Li,Siyu Wang,Meng Zhang,Weitao Li,Yunghwei Lai,Xinhui Kang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu

In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital
that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses,
and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our
central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within
the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the
simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases
and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful
and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment
performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More
interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital
is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten
thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved
doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the
MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way
for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical
scenarios.

##### **Unraveling the Dominance of Large Language Models Over Transformer Models for Bangla Natural Language Inference: A Comprehensive Study**
2405.02937v2 by Fatema Tuj Johora Faria,Mukaffi Bin Moin,Asif Iftekher Fahim,Pronay Debnath,Faisal Muhammad Shah

Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a cornerstone of Natural Language
Processing (NLP), providing insights into the entailment relationships between
text pairings. It is a critical component of Natural Language Understanding
(NLU), demonstrating the ability to extract information from spoken or written
interactions. NLI is mainly concerned with determining the entailment
relationship between two statements, known as the premise and hypothesis. When
the premise logically implies the hypothesis, the pair is labeled "entailment".
If the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the pair receives the
"contradiction" label. When there is insufficient evidence to establish a
connection, the pair is described as "neutral". Despite the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, their effectiveness in NLI remains
constrained by issues like low-resource domain accuracy, model overconfidence,
and difficulty in capturing human judgment disagreements. This study addresses
the underexplored area of evaluating LLMs in low-resourced languages such as
Bengali. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we assess the performance of
prominent LLMs and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in Bengali NLP tasks,
focusing on natural language inference. Utilizing the XNLI dataset, we conduct
zero-shot and few-shot evaluations, comparing LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo and
Gemini 1.5 Pro with models such as BanglaBERT, Bangla BERT Base, DistilBERT,
mBERT, and sahajBERT. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can achieve
comparable or superior performance to fine-tuned SOTA models in few-shot
scenarios, further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of LLMs
in languages with modest resources like Bengali. This study underscores the
importance of continued efforts in exploring LLM capabilities across diverse
linguistic contexts.

##### **On the tractability of SHAP explanations under Markovian distributions**
2405.02936v1 by Reda Marzouk,Colin de La Higuera

Thanks to its solid theoretical foundation, the SHAP framework is arguably
one the most widely utilized frameworks for local explainability of ML models.
Despite its popularity, its exact computation is known to be very challenging,
proven to be NP-Hard in various configurations. Recent works have unveiled
positive complexity results regarding the computation of the SHAP score for
specific model families, encompassing decision trees, random forests, and some
classes of boolean circuits. Yet, all these positive results hinge on the
assumption of feature independence, often simplistic in real-world scenarios.
In this article, we investigate the computational complexity of the SHAP score
by relaxing this assumption and introducing a Markovian perspective. We show
that, under the Markovian assumption, computing the SHAP score for the class of
Weighted automata, Disjoint DNFs and Decision Trees can be performed in
polynomial time, offering a first positive complexity result for the problem of
SHAP score computation that transcends the limitations of the feature
independence assumption.

##### **Relay Decoding: Concatenating Large Language Models for Machine Translation**
2405.02933v1 by Chengpeng Fu,Xiaocheng Feng,Yichong Huang,Wenshuai Huo,Baohang Li,Hui Wang,Bin Qin,Ting Liu

Leveraging large language models for machine translation has demonstrated
promising results. However, it does require the large language models to
possess the capability of handling both the source and target languages in
machine translation. When it is challenging to find large models that support
the desired languages, resorting to continuous learning methods becomes a
costly endeavor. To mitigate these expenses, we propose an innovative approach
called RD (Relay Decoding), which entails concatenating two distinct large
models that individually support the source and target languages. By
incorporating a simple mapping layer to facilitate the connection between these
two models and utilizing a limited amount of parallel data for training, we
successfully achieve superior results in the machine translation task.
Experimental results conducted on the Multi30k and WikiMatrix datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

##### **Unified Dynamic Scanpath Predictors Outperform Individually Trained Neural Models**
2405.02929v2 by Fares Abawi,Di Fu,Stefan Wermter

Previous research on scanpath prediction has mainly focused on group models,
disregarding the fact that the scanpaths and attentional behaviors of
individuals are diverse. The disregard of these differences is especially
detrimental to social human-robot interaction, whereby robots commonly emulate
human gaze based on heuristics or predefined patterns. However, human gaze
patterns are heterogeneous and varying behaviors can significantly affect the
outcomes of such human-robot interactions. To fill this gap, we developed a
deep learning-based social cue integration model for saliency prediction to
instead predict scanpaths in videos. Our model learned scanpaths by recursively
integrating fixation history and social cues through a gating mechanism and
sequential attention. We evaluated our approach on gaze datasets of dynamic
social scenes, observed under the free-viewing condition. The introduction of
fixation history into our models makes it possible to train a single unified
model rather than the resource-intensive approach of training individual models
for each set of scanpaths. We observed that the late neural integration
approach surpasses early fusion when training models on a large dataset, in
comparison to a smaller dataset with a similar distribution. Results also
indicate that a single unified model, trained on all the observers' scanpaths,
performs on par or better than individually trained models. We hypothesize that
this outcome is a result of the group saliency representations instilling
universal attention in the model, while the supervisory signal and fixation
history guide it to learn personalized attentional behaviors, providing the
unified model a benefit over individual models due to its implicit
representation of universal attention.

##### **A Two-Stage Prediction-Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Multi-Intent NLU**
2405.02925v1 by Guanhua Chen,Yutong Yao,Derek F. Wong,Lidia S. Chao

Multi-intent natural language understanding (NLU) presents a formidable
challenge due to the model confusion arising from multiple intents within a
single utterance. While previous works train the model contrastively to
increase the margin between different multi-intent labels, they are less suited
to the nuances of multi-intent NLU. They ignore the rich information between
the shared intents, which is beneficial to constructing a better embedding
space, especially in low-data scenarios. We introduce a two-stage
Prediction-Aware Contrastive Learning (PACL) framework for multi-intent NLU to
harness this valuable knowledge. Our approach capitalizes on shared intent
information by integrating word-level pre-training and prediction-aware
contrastive fine-tuning. We construct a pre-training dataset using a word-level
data augmentation strategy. Subsequently, our framework dynamically assigns
roles to instances during contrastive fine-tuning while introducing a
prediction-aware contrastive loss to maximize the impact of contrastive
learning. We present experimental results and empirical analysis conducted on
three widely used datasets, demonstrating that our method surpasses the
performance of three prominent baselines on both low-data and full-data
scenarios.

##### **Overconfidence is Key: Verbalized Uncertainty Evaluation in Large Language and Vision-Language Models**
2405.02917v1 by Tobias Groot,Matias Valdenegro-Toro

Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs/VLMs) have revolutionized the field
of AI by their ability to generate human-like text and understand images, but
ensuring their reliability is crucial. This paper aims to evaluate the ability
of LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM 2) and VLMs (GPT4V and Gemini Pro
Vision) to estimate their verbalized uncertainty via prompting. We propose the
new Japanese Uncertain Scenes (JUS) dataset, aimed at testing VLM capabilities
via difficult queries and object counting, and the Net Calibration Error (NCE)
to measure direction of miscalibration. Results show that both LLMs and VLMs
have a high calibration error and are overconfident most of the time,
indicating a poor capability for uncertainty estimation. Additionally we
develop prompts for regression tasks, and we show that VLMs have poor
calibration when producing mean/standard deviation and 95% confidence
intervals.

##### **Sentiment Analysis Across Languages: Evaluation Before and After Machine Translation to English**
2405.02887v1 by Aekansh Kathunia,Mohammad Kaif,Nalin Arora,N Narotam

People communicate in more than 7,000 languages around the world, with around
780 languages spoken in India alone. Despite this linguistic diversity,
research on Sentiment Analysis has predominantly focused on English text data,
resulting in a disproportionate availability of sentiment resources for
English. This paper examines the performance of transformer models in Sentiment
Analysis tasks across multilingual datasets and text that has undergone machine
translation. By comparing the effectiveness of these models in different
linguistic contexts, we gain insights into their performance variations and
potential implications for sentiment analysis across diverse languages. We also
discuss the shortcomings and potential for future work towards the end.

##### **Revisiting a Pain in the Neck: Semantic Phrase Processing Benchmark for Language Models**
2405.02861v1 by Yang Liu,Melissa Xiaohui Qin,Hongming Li,Chao Huang

We introduce LexBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite enabled to test
language models (LMs) on ten semantic phrase processing tasks. Unlike prior
studies, it is the first work to propose a framework from the comparative
perspective to model the general semantic phrase (i.e., lexical collocation)
and three fine-grained semantic phrases, including idiomatic expression, noun
compound, and verbal construction. Thanks to \ourbenchmark, we assess the
performance of 15 LMs across model architectures and parameter scales in
classification, extraction, and interpretation tasks. Through the experiments,
we first validate the scaling law and find that, as expected, large models
excel better than the smaller ones in most tasks. Second, we investigate
further through the scaling semantic relation categorization and find that
few-shot LMs still lag behind vanilla fine-tuned models in the task. Third,
through human evaluation, we find that the performance of strong models is
comparable to the human level regarding semantic phrase processing. Our
benchmarking findings can serve future research aiming to improve the generic
capability of LMs on semantic phrase comprehension. Our source code and data
are available at https://github.com/jacklanda/LexBench

##### **Language Evolution for Evading Social Media Regulation via LLM-based Multi-agent Simulation**
2405.02858v1 by Jinyu Cai,Jialong Li,Mingyue Zhang,Munan Li,Chen-Shu Wang,Kenji Tei

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Sina Weibo play a crucial
role in global communication but often encounter strict regulations in
geopolitically sensitive regions. This situation has prompted users to
ingeniously modify their way of communicating, frequently resorting to coded
language in these regulated social media environments. This shift in
communication is not merely a strategy to counteract regulation, but a vivid
manifestation of language evolution, demonstrating how language naturally
evolves under societal and technological pressures. Studying the evolution of
language in regulated social media contexts is of significant importance for
ensuring freedom of speech, optimizing content moderation, and advancing
linguistic research. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation framework
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the evolution of user language in
regulated social media environments. The framework employs LLM-driven agents:
supervisory agent who enforce dialogue supervision and participant agents who
evolve their language strategies while engaging in conversation, simulating the
evolution of communication styles under strict regulations aimed at evading
social media regulation. The study evaluates the framework's effectiveness
through a range of scenarios from abstract scenarios to real-world situations.
Key findings indicate that LLMs are capable of simulating nuanced language
dynamics and interactions in constrained settings, showing improvement in both
evading supervision and information accuracy as evolution progresses.
Furthermore, it was found that LLM agents adopt different strategies for
different scenarios.

##### **Modelling Opaque Bilateral Market Dynamics in Financial Trading: Insights from a Multi-Agent Simulation Study**
2405.02849v1 by Alicia Vidler,Toby Walsh

Exploring complex adaptive financial trading environments through multi-agent
based simulation methods presents an innovative approach within the realm of
quantitative finance. Despite the dominance of multi-agent reinforcement
learning approaches in financial markets with observable data, there exists a
set of systematically significant financial markets that pose challenges due to
their partial or obscured data availability. We, therefore, devise a
multi-agent simulation approach employing small-scale meta-heuristic methods.
This approach aims to represent the opaque bilateral market for Australian
government bond trading, capturing the bilateral nature of bank-to-bank
trading, also referred to as "over-the-counter" (OTC) trading, and commonly
occurring between "market makers". The uniqueness of the bilateral market,
characterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields
valuable insights for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The
inherent rigidity of this market structure, which is at odds with the global
proliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance,
underscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore
the implications of market rigidity on market structure and consider the
element of stability, in market design. This extends the ongoing discourse on
complex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of
their dynamics and implications.

Shifting the focus from principles to practical implementation, responsible
artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered considerable attention across
academia, industry, and society at large. Despite being in its nascent stages,
this emerging field grapples with nebulous concepts and intricate knowledge
frameworks. By analyzing three prevailing concepts - explainable AI,
trustworthy AI, and ethical AI, this study defined responsible AI and
identified its core principles. Methodologically, this study successfully
demonstrated the implementation of leveraging AI's capabilities into
bibliometrics for enhanced knowledge discovery and the cross-validation of
experimentally examined models with domain insights. Empirically, this study
investigated 17,799 research articles contributed by the AI community since
2015. This involves recognizing key technological players and their
relationships, unveiling the topical landscape and hierarchy of responsible AI,
charting its evolution, and elucidating the interplay between the
responsibility principles and primary AI techniques. An analysis of a core
cohort comprising 380 articles from multiple disciplines captures the most
recent advancements in responsible AI. As one of the pioneering bibliometric
studies dedicated to exploring responsible AI, this study will provide
comprehensive macro-level insights, enhancing the understanding of responsible
AI while furnishing valuable knowledge support for AI regulation and governance
initiatives.

##### **Sim2Real Transfer for Audio-Visual Navigation with Frequency-Adaptive Acoustic Field Prediction**
2405.02821v1 by Changan Chen,Jordi Ramos,Anshul Tomar,Kristen Grauman

Sim2real transfer has received increasing attention lately due to the success
of learning robotic tasks in simulation end-to-end. While there has been a lot
of progress in transferring vision-based navigation policies, the existing
sim2real strategy for audio-visual navigation performs data augmentation
empirically without measuring the acoustic gap. The sound differs from light in
that it spans across much wider frequencies and thus requires a different
solution for sim2real. We propose the first treatment of sim2real for
audio-visual navigation by disentangling it into acoustic field prediction
(AFP) and waypoint navigation. We first validate our design choice in the
SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal
navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral
difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models
that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a
frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band
for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy
distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real
data. Lastly, we build a real robot platform and show that the transferred
policy can successfully navigate to sounding objects. This work demonstrates
the potential of building intelligent agents that can see, hear, and act
entirely from simulation, and transferring them to the real world.

##### **Stochastic RAG: End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Expected Utility Maximization**
2405.02816v1 by Hamed Zamani,Michael Bendersky

This paper introduces Stochastic RAG--a novel approach for end-to-end
optimization of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models that relaxes the
simplifying assumptions of marginalization and document independence, made in
most prior work. Stochastic RAG casts the retrieval process in RAG as a
stochastic sampling without replacement process. Through this formulation, we
employ straight-through Gumbel-top-k that provides a differentiable
approximation for sampling without replacement and enables effective end-to-end
optimization for RAG. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse
datasets on a wide range of tasks, from open-domain question answering to fact
verification to slot-filling for relation extraction and to dialogue systems.
By applying this optimization method to a recent and effective RAG model, we
advance state-of-the-art results on six out of seven datasets.

2405.02815v1 by Zhusi Zhong,Jie Li,Zhuoqi Ma,Scott Collins,Harrison Bai,Paul Zhang,Terrance Healey,Xinbo Gao,Michael K. Atalay,Zhicheng Jiao

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global public health, necessitating
accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce
mortality rates. This paper introduces an interpretable deep survival
prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in
COVID-19 prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. By integrating a large-scale
pretrained image encoder, Risk-specific Grad-CAM, and anatomical region
detection techniques, our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes
that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but
critical abnormal regions. Our model's predictive results provide enhanced
clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to
make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with better understanding
of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center
survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and
qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and
time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our
explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival
analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical
decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.

##### **NegativePrompt: Leveraging Psychology for Large Language Models Enhancement via Negative Emotional Stimuli**
2405.02814v1 by Xu Wang,Cheng Li,Yi Chang,Jindong Wang,Yuan Wu

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to a wide spectrum of
applications, ranging from traditional computing tasks to advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) applications. This widespread adoption has spurred extensive
research into LLMs across various disciplines, including the social sciences.
Notably, studies have revealed that LLMs possess emotional intelligence, which
can be further developed through positive emotional stimuli. This discovery
raises an intriguing question: can negative emotions similarly influence LLMs,
potentially enhancing their performance? In response to this question, we
introduce NegativePrompt, a novel approach underpinned by psychological
principles, involving ten specifically designed negative emotional stimuli. We
embark on rigorous experimental evaluations of five LLMs including
Flan-T5-Large, Vicuna, Llama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, across a set of 45 tasks.
The results are revealing: NegativePrompt markedly enhances the performance of
LLMs, evidenced by relative improvements of 12.89% in Instruction Induction
tasks and 46.25% in BIG-Bench tasks. Moreover, we conduct attention
visualization experiments to decipher the underlying mechanisms of
NegativePrompt's influence. Our research contributes significantly to the
understanding of LLMs and emotion interaction, demonstrating the practical
efficacy of NegativePrompt as an emotion-driven method and offering novel
insights for the enhancement of LLMs in real-world applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangxu0820/NegativePrompt.

2405.02807v1 by Leye Zhang,Xiangxiang Tian,Hongjun Zhang

Attempt to use convolutional neural network to achieve kinematic analysis of
plane bar structure. Through 3dsMax animation software and OpenCV module,
self-build image dataset of geometrically stable system and geometrically
unstable system. we construct and train convolutional neural network model
based on the TensorFlow and Keras deep learning platform framework. The model
achieves 100% accuracy on the training set, validation set, and test set. The
accuracy on the additional test set is 93.7%, indicating that convolutional
neural network can learn and master the relevant knowledge of kinematic
analysis of structural mechanics. In the future, the generalization ability of
the model can be improved through the diversity of dataset, which has the
potential to surpass human experts for complex structures. Convolutional neural
network has certain practical value in the field of kinematic analysis of
structural mechanics. Using visualization technology, we reveal how
convolutional neural network learns and recognizes structural features. Using
pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning, we found that
the generalization ability is inferior to the self-built model.

##### **Mozart's Touch: A Lightweight Multi-modal Music Generation Framework Based on Pre-Trained Large Models**
2405.02801v2 by Tianze Xu,Jiajun Li,Xuesong Chen,Xinrui Yao,Shuchang Liu

In recent years, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has witnessed rapid
advancements, facilitating the generation of music, images, and other forms of
artistic expression across various industries. However, researches on general
multi-modal music generation model remain scarce. To fill this gap, we propose
a multi-modal music generation framework Mozart's Touch. It could generate
aligned music with the cross-modality inputs, such as images, videos and text.
Mozart's Touch is composed of three main components: Multi-modal Captioning
Module, Large Language Model (LLM) Understanding & Bridging Module, and Music
Generation Module. Unlike traditional approaches, Mozart's Touch requires no
training or fine-tuning pre-trained models, offering efficiency and
transparency through clear, interpretable prompts. We also introduce
"LLM-Bridge" method to resolve the heterogeneous representation problems
between descriptive texts of different modalities. We conduct a series of
objective and subjective evaluations on the proposed model, and results
indicate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art
models. Our codes and examples is availble at:

##### **ImageInWords: Unlocking Hyper-Detailed Image Descriptions**
2405.02793v1 by Roopal Garg,Andrea Burns,Burcu Karagol Ayan,Yonatan Bitton,Ceslee Montgomery,Yasumasa Onoe,Andrew Bunner,Ranjay Krishna,Jason Baldridge,Radu Soricut

Despite the longstanding adage "an image is worth a thousand words," creating
accurate and hyper-detailed image descriptions for training Vision-Language
models remains challenging. Current datasets typically have web-scraped
descriptions that are short, low-granularity, and often contain details
unrelated to the visual content. As a result, models trained on such data
generate descriptions replete with missing information, visual inconsistencies,
and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce ImageInWords (IIW), a
carefully designed human-in-the-loop annotation framework for curating
hyper-detailed image descriptions and a new dataset resulting from this
process. We validate the framework through evaluations focused on the quality
of the dataset and its utility for fine-tuning with considerations for
readability, comprehensiveness, specificity, hallucinations, and
human-likeness. Our dataset significantly improves across these dimensions
compared to recently released datasets (+66%) and GPT-4V outputs (+48%).
Furthermore, models fine-tuned with IIW data excel by +31% against prior work
along the same human evaluation dimensions. Given our fine-tuned models, we
also evaluate text-to-image generation and vision-language reasoning. Our
model's descriptions can generate images closest to the original, as judged by
both automated and human metrics. We also find our model produces more
compositionally rich descriptions, outperforming the best baseline by up to 6%
on ARO, SVO-Probes, and Winoground datasets.

##### **Efficient Text-driven Motion Generation via Latent Consistency Training**
2405.02791v1 by Mengxian Hu,Minghao Zhu,Xun Zhou,Qingqing Yan,Shu Li,Chengju Liu,Qijun Chen

Motion diffusion models have recently proven successful for text-driven human
motion generation. Despite their excellent generation performance, they are
challenging to infer in real time due to the multi-step sampling mechanism that
involves tens or hundreds of repeat function evaluation iterations. To this
end, we investigate a motion latent consistency Training (MLCT) for motion
generation to alleviate the computation and time consumption during iteration
inference. It applies diffusion pipelines to low-dimensional motion latent
spaces to mitigate the computational burden of each function evaluation.
Explaining the diffusion process with probabilistic flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) theory, the MLCT allows extremely few steps infer between the
prior distribution to the motion latent representation distribution via
maintaining consistency of the outputs over the trajectory of PF-ODE.
Especially, we introduce a quantization constraint to optimize motion latent
representations that are bounded, regular, and well-reconstructed compared to
traditional variational constraints. Furthermore, we propose a conditional
PF-ODE trajectory simulation method, which improves the conditional generation
performance with minimal additional training costs. Extensive experiments on
two human motion generation benchmarks show that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance with less than 10\% time cost.

##### **Get more for less: Principled Data Selection for Warming Up Fine-Tuning in LLMs**
2405.02774v1 by Feiyang Kang,Hoang Anh Just,Yifan Sun,Himanshu Jahagirdar,Yuanzhi Zhang,Rongxing Du,Anit Kumar Sahu,Ruoxi Jia

This work focuses on leveraging and selecting from vast, unlabeled, open data
to pre-fine-tune a pre-trained language model. The goal is to minimize the need
for costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving
desired performance levels. While many data selection algorithms have been
designed for small-scale applications, rendering them unsuitable for our
context, some emerging methods do cater to language data scales. However, they
often prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this
strategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield
limited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different
distribution. Differing from prior work, our key idea is to select data that
nudges the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution. We show
the optimality of this approach for fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology across a diverse array of tasks
(NLU, NLG, zero-shot) with models up to 2.7B, showing that it consistently
surpasses other selection methods. Moreover, our proposed method is
significantly faster than existing techniques, scaling to millions of samples
within a single GPU hour. Our code is open-sourced (Code repository:
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/ ). While fine-tuning offers
significant potential for enhancing performance across diverse tasks, its
associated costs often limit its widespread adoption; with this work, we hope
to lay the groundwork for cost-effective fine-tuning, making its benefits more
accessible.

##### **Beyond Unimodal Learning: The Importance of Integrating Multiple Modalities for Lifelong Learning**
2405.02766v1 by Fahad Sarfraz,Bahram Zonooz,Elahe Arani

While humans excel at continual learning (CL), deep neural networks (DNNs)
exhibit catastrophic forgetting. A salient feature of the brain that allows
effective CL is that it utilizes multiple modalities for learning and
inference, which is underexplored in DNNs. Therefore, we study the role and
interactions of multiple modalities in mitigating forgetting and introduce a
benchmark for multimodal continual learning. Our findings demonstrate that
leveraging multiple views and complementary information from multiple
modalities enables the model to learn more accurate and robust representations.
This makes the model less vulnerable to modality-specific regularities and
considerably mitigates forgetting. Furthermore, we observe that individual
modalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness to distribution shift.
Finally, we propose a method for integrating and aligning the information from
different modalities by utilizing the relational structural similarities
between the data points in each modality. Our method sets a strong baseline
that enables both single- and multimodal inference. Our study provides a
promising case for further exploring the role of multiple modalities in
enabling CL and provides a standard benchmark for future research.

##### **Detecting Edited Knowledge in Language Models**
2405.02765v1 by Paul Youssef,Zhixue Zhao,Jörg Schlötterer,Christin Seifert

Knowledge editing techniques (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or
inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KE also faces
potential malicious applications, e.g. inserting misinformation and toxic
content. Moreover, in the context of responsible AI, it is instructive for
end-users to know whether a generated output is driven by edited knowledge or
first-hand knowledge from pre-training. To this end, we study detecting edited
knowledge in language models by introducing a novel task: given an edited model
and a specific piece of knowledge the model generates, our objective is to
classify the knowledge as either "non-edited" (based on the pre-training), or
``edited'' (based on subsequent editing). We initiate the task with two
state-of-the-art KEs, two language models, and two datasets. We further propose
a simple classifier, RepReg, a logistic regression model that takes hidden
state representations as input features. Our results reveal that RepReg
establishes a strong baseline, achieving a peak accuracy of 99.81%, and 97.79%
in out-of-domain settings. Second, RepReg achieves near-optimal performance
with a limited training set (200 training samples), and it maintains its
performance even in out-of-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging
to separate edited and non-edited knowledge when they contain the same subject
or object.

##### **Assessing Adversarial Robustness of Large Language Models: An Empirical Study**
2405.02764v1 by Zeyu Yang,Zhao Meng,Xiaochen Zheng,Roger Wattenhofer

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their robustness against adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. We
presents a novel white-box style attack approach that exposes vulnerabilities
in leading open-source LLMs, including Llama, OPT, and T5. We assess the impact
of model size, structure, and fine-tuning strategies on their resistance to
adversarial perturbations. Our comprehensive evaluation across five diverse
text classification tasks establishes a new benchmark for LLM robustness. The
findings of this study have far-reaching implications for the reliable
deployment of LLMs in real-world applications and contribute to the advancement
of trustworthy AI systems.

##### **Implicit Safe Set Algorithm for Provably Safe Reinforcement Learning**
2405.02754v1 by Weiye Zhao,Tairan He,Feihan Li,Changliu Liu

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
many continuous control tasks. However, a significant obstacle to the
real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL
agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping,
designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety
specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast,
existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent
satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require
explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which
are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a
model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for
synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout
training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier
certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box
dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically
prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence
to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and
discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the
state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations
while gaining $95\% \pm 9\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art
safe DRL methods. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm scales well to
high-dimensional systems with parallel computing.

##### **Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Large Language Models through Contrastive Decoding**
2405.02750v1 by Zheng Zhao,Emilio Monti,Jens Lehmann,Haytham Assem

Large language models (LLMs) tend to inadequately integrate input context
during text generation, relying excessively on encoded prior knowledge in model
parameters, potentially resulting in generated text with factual
inconsistencies or contextually unfaithful content. LLMs utilize two primary
knowledge sources: 1) prior (parametric) knowledge from pretraining, and 2)
contextual (non-parametric) knowledge from input prompts. The study addresses
the open question of how LLMs effectively balance these knowledge sources
during the generation process, specifically in the context of open-domain
question answering. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach
integrating contrastive decoding with adversarial irrelevant passages as
negative samples to enhance robust context grounding during generation.
Notably, our method operates at inference time without requiring further
training. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its applicability
and effectiveness, providing empirical evidence showcasing its superiority over
existing methodologies. Our code is publicly available at:
https://github.com/amazon-science/ContextualUnderstanding-ContrastiveDecoding.

##### **GREEN: Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation**
2405.03595v1 by Sophie Ostmeier,Justin Xu,Zhihong Chen,Maya Varma,Louis Blankemeier,Christian Bluethgen,Arne Edward Michalson,Michael Moseley,Curtis Langlotz,Akshay S Chaudhari,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck

Evaluating radiology reports is a challenging problem as factual correctness
is extremely important due to the need for accurate medical communication about
medical images. Existing automatic evaluation metrics either suffer from
failing to consider factual correctness (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or are limited
in their interpretability (e.g., F1CheXpert and F1RadGraph). In this paper, we
introduce GREEN (Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation), a
radiology report generation metric that leverages the natural language
understanding of language models to identify and explain clinically significant
errors in candidate reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to
current metrics, GREEN offers: 1) a score aligned with expert preferences, 2)
human interpretable explanations of clinically significant errors, enabling
feedback loops with end-users, and 3) a lightweight open-source method that
reaches the performance of commercial counterparts. We validate our GREEN
metric by comparing it to GPT-4, as well as to error counts of 6 experts and
preferences of 2 experts. Our method demonstrates not only higher correlation
with expert error counts, but simultaneously higher alignment with expert
preferences when compared to previous approaches."

##### **RepVGG-GELAN: Enhanced GELAN with VGG-STYLE ConvNets for Brain Tumour Detection**
2405.03541v1 by Thennarasi Balakrishnan,Sandeep Singh Sengar

Object detection algorithms particularly those based on YOLO have
demonstrated remarkable efficiency in balancing speed and accuracy. However,
their application in brain tumour detection remains underexplored. This study
proposes RepVGG-GELAN, a novel YOLO architecture enhanced with RepVGG, a
reparameterized convolutional approach for object detection tasks particularly
focusing on brain tumour detection within medical images. RepVGG-GELAN
leverages the RepVGG architecture to improve both speed and accuracy in
detecting brain tumours. Integrating RepVGG into the YOLO framework aims to
achieve a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance.
This study includes a spatial pyramid pooling-based Generalized Efficient Layer
Aggregation Network (GELAN) architecture which further enhances the capability
of RepVGG. Experimental evaluation conducted on a brain tumour dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of RepVGG-GELAN surpassing existing RCS-YOLO in
terms of precision and speed. Specifically, RepVGG-GELAN achieves an increased
precision of 4.91% and an increased AP50 of 2.54% over the latest existing
approach while operating at 240.7 GFLOPs. The proposed RepVGG-GELAN with GELAN
architecture presents promising results establishing itself as a
state-of-the-art solution for accurate and efficient brain tumour detection in
medical images. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/ThensiB/RepVGG-GELAN.

##### **A Lightweight Neural Architecture Search Model for Medical Image Classification**
2405.03462v1 by Lunchen Xie,Eugenio Lomurno,Matteo Gambella,Danilo Ardagna,Manuel Roveri,Matteo Matteucci,Qingjiang Shi

Accurate classification of medical images is essential for modern
diagnostics. Deep learning advancements led clinicians to increasingly use
sophisticated models to make faster and more accurate decisions, sometimes
replacing human judgment. However, model development is costly and repetitive.
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides solutions by automating the design of
deep learning architectures. This paper presents ZO-DARTS+, a differentiable
NAS algorithm that improves search efficiency through a novel method of
generating sparse probabilities by bi-level optimization. Experiments on five
public medical datasets show that ZO-DARTS+ matches the accuracy of
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing search times by up to three times.

##### **Automated Computation of Therapies Using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in the Medical Domain**
2405.03406v1 by Malte Luttermann,Edgar Baake,Juljan Bouchagiar,Benjamin Gebel,Philipp Grüning,Dilini Manikwadura,Franziska Schollemann,Elisa Teifke,Philipp Rostalski,Ralf Möller

Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic approach to identify
and analyse potential failures and their effects in a system or process. The
FMEA approach, however, requires domain experts to manually analyse the FMEA
model to derive risk-reducing actions that should be applied. In this paper, we
provide a formal framework to allow for automatic planning and acting in FMEA
models. More specifically, we cast the FMEA model into a Markov decision
process which can then be solved by existing solvers. We show that the FMEA
approach can not only be used to support medical experts during the modelling
process but also to automatically derive optimal therapies for the treatment of
patients.

##### **MedDoc-Bot: A Chat Tool for Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models in the Context of the Pediatric Hypertension Guideline**
2405.03359v1 by Mohamed Yaseen Jabarulla,Steffen Oeltze-Jafra,Philipp Beerbaum,Theodor Uden

This research focuses on evaluating the non-commercial open-source large
language models (LLMs) Meditron, MedAlpaca, Mistral, and Llama-2 for their
efficacy in interpreting medical guidelines saved in PDF format. As a specific
test scenario, we applied these models to the guidelines for hypertension in
children and adolescents provided by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).
Leveraging Streamlit, a Python library, we developed a user-friendly medical
document chatbot tool (MedDoc-Bot). This tool enables authorized users to
upload PDF files and pose questions, generating interpretive responses from
four locally stored LLMs. A pediatric expert provides a benchmark for
evaluation by formulating questions and responses extracted from the ESC
guidelines. The expert rates the model-generated responses based on their
fidelity and relevance. Additionally, we evaluated the METEOR and chrF metric
scores to assess the similarity of model responses to reference answers. Our
study found that Llama-2 and Mistral performed well in metrics evaluation.
However, Llama-2 was slower when dealing with text and tabular data. In our
human evaluation, we observed that responses created by Mistral, Meditron, and
Llama-2 exhibited reasonable fidelity and relevance. This study provides
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for future
developments in medical document interpretation. Open-Source Code:

##### **Artificial Intelligence in the Autonomous Navigation of Endovascular Interventions: A Systematic Review**
2405.03305v1 by Harry Robertshaw,Lennart Karstensen,Benjamin Jackson,Hadi Sadati,Kawal Rhode,Sebastien Ourselin,Alejandro Granados,Thomas C Booth

Purpose: Autonomous navigation of devices in endovascular interventions can
decrease operation times, improve decision-making during surgery, and reduce
operator radiation exposure while increasing access to treatment. This
systematic review explores recent literature to assess the impact, challenges,
and opportunities artificial intelligence (AI) has for the autonomous
endovascular intervention navigation.
  Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried. Eligibility criteria
included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous
navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions. Following
PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2. PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.
  Results: Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria. Reinforcement
learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as
data-driven models for autonomous navigation. Studies predominantly utilised
physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models. Experiments
within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority
of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used
in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study.
We observed that risk of bias and poor generalisability were present across
studies. No procedures were performed on patients in any of the studies
reviewed. Studies lacked patient selection criteria, reference standards, and
reproducibility, resulting in low clinical evidence levels.
  Conclusions: AI's potential in autonomous endovascular navigation is
promising, but in an experimental proof-of-concept stage, with a technology
readiness level of 3. We highlight that reference standards with
well-identified performance metrics are crucial to allow for comparisons of
data-driven algorithms proposed in the years to come.

Ali Eslami,Daniel Tse,Shruthi Prabhakara,Cory McLean,Dave Steiner,Rory Pilgrim,Christopher Kelly,Shekoofeh Azizi,Daniel Golden

Many clinical tasks require an understanding of specialized data, such as
medical images and genomics, which is not typically found in general-purpose
large multimodal models. Building upon Gemini's multimodal models, we develop
several models within the new Med-Gemini family that inherit core capabilities
of Gemini and are optimized for medical use via fine-tuning with 2D and 3D
radiology, histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology and genomic data.
Med-Gemini-2D sets a new standard for AI-based chest X-ray (CXR) report
generation based on expert evaluation, exceeding previous best results across
two separate datasets by an absolute margin of 1% and 12%, where 57% and 96% of
AI reports on normal cases, and 43% and 65% on abnormal cases, are evaluated as
"equivalent or better" than the original radiologists' reports. We demonstrate
the first ever large multimodal model-based report generation for 3D computed
tomography (CT) volumes using Med-Gemini-3D, with 53% of AI reports considered
clinically acceptable, although additional research is needed to meet expert
radiologist reporting quality. Beyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D
surpasses the previous best performance in CXR visual question answering (VQA)
and performs well in CXR classification and radiology VQA, exceeding SoTA or
baselines on 17 of 20 tasks. In histopathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology
image classification, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses baselines across 18 out of 20
tasks and approaches task-specific model performance. Beyond imaging,
Med-Gemini-Polygenic outperforms the standard linear polygenic risk score-based
approach for disease risk prediction and generalizes to genetically correlated
diseases for which it has never been trained. Although further development and
evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical medical domain, our results
highlight the potential of Med-Gemini across a wide range of medical tasks.

##### **Automatic Ultrasound Curve Angle Measurement via Affinity Clustering for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Evaluation**
2405.03141v2 by Yihao Zhou,Timothy Tin-Yan Lee,Kelly Ka-Lee Lai,Chonglin Wu,Hin Ting Lau,De Yang,Chui-Yi Chan,Winnie Chiu-Wing Chu,Jack Chun-Yiu Cheng,Tsz-Ping Lam,Yong-Ping Zheng

The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic
scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However,
the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge
due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been
validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis
assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out
manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic
system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this
end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle
(UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate
landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An
affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area
to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks.
Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered
affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for
UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for
landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic
UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can
potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.

##### **RICE: Breaking Through the Training Bottlenecks of Reinforcement Learning with Explanation**
2405.03064v1 by Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Jiahao Yu,Sabrina Yang,Gang Wang,Xinyu Xing

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role
in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL
agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant
challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck
without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative
refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation
methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE
is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default
initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods,
thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through
careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a
tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL
environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE
significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent
performance.

##### **AC-MAMBASEG: An adaptive convolution and Mamba-based architecture for enhanced skin lesion segmentation**
2405.03011v1 by Viet-Thanh Nguyen,Van-Truong Pham,Thi-Thao Tran

Skin lesion segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis
systems for dermatological diseases. Accurate segmentation of skin lesions from
medical images is essential for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment
planning. In this paper, we propose a new model for skin lesion segmentation
namely AC-MambaSeg, an enhanced model that has the hybrid CNN-Mamba backbone,
and integrates advanced components such as Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM), Attention Gate, and Selective Kernel Bottleneck. AC-MambaSeg leverages
the Vision Mamba framework for efficient feature extraction, while CBAM and

and suppress background noise. We evaluate the performance of AC-MambaSeg on
diverse datasets of skin lesion images including ISIC-2018 and PH2; then
compare it against existing segmentation methods. Our model shows promising
potential for improving computer-aided diagnosis systems and facilitating early
detection and treatment of dermatological diseases. Our source code will be

##### **Agent Hospital: A Simulacrum of Hospital with Evolvable Medical Agents**
2405.02957v1 by Junkai Li,Siyu Wang,Meng Zhang,Weitao Li,Yunghwei Lai,Xinhui Kang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu

In this paper, we introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital
that simulates the entire process of treating illness. All patients, nurses,
and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our
central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within
the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the
simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases
and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful
and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment
performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More
interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital
is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten
thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved
doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the
MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way
for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical
scenarios.

2405.02815v1 by Zhusi Zhong,Jie Li,Zhuoqi Ma,Scott Collins,Harrison Bai,Paul Zhang,Terrance Healey,Xinbo Gao,Michael K. Atalay,Zhicheng Jiao

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global public health, necessitating
accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce
mortality rates. This paper introduces an interpretable deep survival
prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in
COVID-19 prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. By integrating a large-scale
pretrained image encoder, Risk-specific Grad-CAM, and anatomical region
detection techniques, our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes
that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but
critical abnormal regions. Our model's predictive results provide enhanced
clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to
make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with better understanding
of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center
survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and
qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and
time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our
explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival
analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical
decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.

2405.02711v1 by Jordyn Young,Laala M Jawara,Diep N Nguyen,Brian Daly,Jina Huh-Yoo,Afsaneh Razi

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated into everyday
technology, including news, education, and social media. AI has further
pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and
response suggestions. As social media becomes young people's main method of
peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and
assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way.
We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded
human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that
participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about
relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a
sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human
response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange
and its implications for supporting young people's well-being. Disclaimer: This
paper includes sensitive topics, including suicide ideation. Reader discretion

2405.02664v1 by Roomani Srivastava,Suraj Prasad,Lipika Bhat,Sarvesh Deshpande,Barnali Das,Kshitij Jadhav

A major roadblock in the seamless digitization of medical records remains the
lack of interoperability of existing records. Extracting relevant medical
information required for further treatment planning or even research is a time
consuming labour intensive task involving the much valuable time of doctors. In
this demo paper we present, MedPromptExtract an automated tool using a
combination of semi supervised learning, large language models, natural
lanuguage processing and prompt engineering to convert unstructured medical
records to structured data which is amenable to further analysis.

##### **A Conformal Prediction Score that is Robust to Label Noise**
2405.02648v1 by Coby Penso,Jacob Goldberger

Conformal Prediction (CP) quantifies network uncertainty by building a small
prediction set with a pre-defined probability that the correct class is within
this set. In this study we tackle the problem of CP calibration based on a
validation set with noisy labels. We introduce a conformal score that is robust
to label noise. The noise-free conformal score is estimated using the noisy
labeled data and the noise level. In the test phase the noise-free score is
used to form the prediction set. We applied the proposed algorithm to several
standard medical imaging classification datasets. We show that our method
outperforms current methods by a large margin, in terms of the average size of
the prediction set, while maintaining the required coverage.

##### **Explainable Interface for Human-Autonomy Teaming: A Survey**
2405.02583v1 by Xiangqi Kong,Yang Xing,Antonios Tsourdos,Ziyue Wang,Weisi Guo,Adolfo Perrusquia,Andreas Wikander

Nowadays, large-scale foundation models are being increasingly integrated
into numerous safety-critical applications, including human-autonomy teaming
(HAT) within transportation, medical, and defence domains. Consequently, the
inherent 'black-box' nature of these sophisticated deep neural networks
heightens the significance of fostering mutual understanding and trust between
humans and autonomous systems. To tackle the transparency challenges in HAT,
this paper conducts a thoughtful study on the underexplored domain of
Explainable Interface (EI) in HAT systems from a human-centric perspective,
thereby enriching the existing body of research in Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI). We explore the design, development, and evaluation of EI
within XAI-enhanced HAT systems. To do so, we first clarify the distinctions
between these concepts: EI, explanations and model explainability, aiming to
provide researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding. Second,
we contribute to a novel framework for EI, addressing the unique challenges in
HAT. Last, our summarized evaluation framework for ongoing EI offers a holistic
perspective, encompassing model performance, human-centered factors, and group
task objectives. Based on extensive surveys across XAI, HAT, psychology, and
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), this review offers multiple novel insights
into incorporating XAI into HAT systems and outlines future directions.

As generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), continues to permeate healthcare, it remains crucial to
supplement traditional automated evaluations with human expert evaluation.
Understanding and evaluating the generated texts is vital for ensuring safety,
reliability, and effectiveness. However, the cumbersome, time-consuming, and
non-standardized nature of human evaluation presents significant obstacles to
the widespread adoption of LLMs in practice. This study reviews existing
literature on human evaluation methodologies for LLMs within healthcare. We
highlight a notable need for a standardized and consistent human evaluation
approach. Our extensive literature search, adhering to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, spans
publications from January 2018 to February 2024. This review provides a
comprehensive overview of the human evaluation approaches used in diverse
healthcare applications.This analysis examines the human evaluation of LLMs
across various medical specialties, addressing factors such as evaluation
dimensions, sample types, and sizes, the selection and recruitment of
evaluators, frameworks and metrics, the evaluation process, and statistical
analysis of the results. Drawing from diverse evaluation strategies highlighted
in these studies, we propose a comprehensive and practical framework for human
evaluation of generative LLMs, named QUEST: Quality of Information,
Understanding and Reasoning, Expression Style and Persona, Safety and Harm, and
Trust and Confidence. This framework aims to improve the reliability,
generalizability, and applicability of human evaluation of generative LLMs in
different healthcare applications by defining clear evaluation dimensions and
offering detailed guidelines.

##### **Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE: A Swin Transformer based Multiscale Representation Learner for Temporal Satellite Imagery**
2405.02512v1 by Yohei Nakayama,Jiawei Su

Currently, the foundation models represented by large language models have
made dramatic progress and are used in a very wide range of domains including
2D and 3D vision. As one of the important application domains of foundation
models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have
been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture,
earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more
channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different
timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set
of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper
presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which
particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image
processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with
Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained
model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an
approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder
and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to
achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named
Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant
improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation
models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task
on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with
other geospatial foundation models on average.

##### **Implicit Neural Representations for Robust Joint Sparse-View CT Reconstruction**
2405.02509v1 by Jiayang Shi,Junyi Zhu,Daniel M. Pelt,K. Joost Batenburg,Matthew B. Blaschko

Computed Tomography (CT) is pivotal in industrial quality control and medical
diagnostics. Sparse-view CT, offering reduced ionizing radiation, faces
challenges due to its under-sampled nature, leading to ill-posed reconstruction
problems. Recent advancements in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have
shown promise in addressing sparse-view CT reconstruction. Recognizing that CT
often involves scanning similar subjects, we propose a novel approach to
improve reconstruction quality through joint reconstruction of multiple objects
using INRs. This approach can potentially leverage both the strengths of INRs
and the statistical regularities across multiple objects. While current INR
joint reconstruction techniques primarily focus on accelerating convergence via
meta-initialization, they are not specifically tailored to enhance
reconstruction quality. To address this gap, we introduce a novel INR-based
Bayesian framework integrating latent variables to capture the inter-object
relationships. These variables serve as a dynamic reference throughout the
optimization, thereby enhancing individual reconstruction fidelity. Our
extensive experiments, which assess various key factors such as reconstruction
quality, resistance to overfitting, and generalizability, demonstrate
significant improvements over baselines in common numerical metrics. This
underscores a notable advancement in CT reconstruction methods.

##### **A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series**
2405.02485v1 by Chenqi Li,Timothy Denison,Tingting Zhu

Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical
records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time
series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical
diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring
capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as
promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively
labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many
barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation,
privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical
considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data
is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past
experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning.
This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning
methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and
limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional
data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current
landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications
for future research and applications.

##### **Generalizing Orthogonalization for Models with Non-linearities**
2405.02475v1 by David Rügamer,Chris Kolb,Tobias Weber,Lucas Kook,Thomas Nagler

The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges,
including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in
the algorithms' application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks
can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond
the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical
expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to
prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current
methodologies allow for the "orthogonalization" or "normalization" of neural
networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in
linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for
non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar
and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network
architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's
effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models,
normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying
pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes.

##### **Model-based reinforcement learning for protein backbone design**
2405.01983v1 by Frederic Renard,Cyprien Courtot,Alfredo Reichlin,Oliver Bent

Designing protein nanomaterials of predefined shape and characteristics has
the potential to dramatically impact the medical industry. Machine learning
(ML) has proven successful in protein design, reducing the need for expensive
wet lab experiment rounds. However, challenges persist in efficiently exploring
the protein fitness landscapes to identify optimal protein designs. In
response, we propose the use of AlphaZero to generate protein backbones,
meeting shape and structural scoring requirements. We extend an existing Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework by incorporating a novel threshold-based
reward and secondary objectives to improve design precision. This innovation
considerably outperforms existing approaches, leading to protein backbones that
better respect structural scores. The application of AlphaZero is novel in the
context of protein backbone design and demonstrates promising performance.
AlphaZero consistently surpasses baseline MCTS by more than 100% in top-down
protein design tasks. Additionally, our application of AlphaZero with secondary
objectives uncovers further promising outcomes, indicating the potential of
model-based reinforcement learning (RL) in navigating the intricate and nuanced
aspects of protein design

As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare and
medicine continue to advance, there is a growing need for competitive
open-source models that can safeguard public interest. With the increasing
availability of highly competitive open base models, the impact of continued
pre-training is increasingly uncertain. In this work, we explore the role of
instruct tuning, model merging, alignment, red teaming and advanced inference
schemes, as means to improve current open models. To that end, we introduce the
Aloe family, a set of open medical LLMs highly competitive within its scale
range. Aloe models are trained on the current best base models (Mistral, LLaMA
3), using a new custom dataset which combines public data sources improved with
synthetic Chain of Thought (CoT). Aloe models undergo an alignment phase,
becoming one of the first few policy-aligned open healthcare LLM using Direct
Preference Optimization, setting a new standard for ethical performance in
healthcare LLMs. Model evaluation expands to include various bias and toxicity
datasets, a dedicated red teaming effort, and a much-needed risk assessment for
healthcare LLMs. Finally, to explore the limits of current LLMs in inference,
we study several advanced prompt engineering strategies to boost performance
across benchmarks, yielding state-of-the-art results for open healthcare 7B
LLMs, unprecedented at this scale.

##### **Millimeter Wave Radar-based Human Activity Recognition for Healthcare Monitoring Robot**
2405.01882v1 by Zhanzhong Gu,Xiangjian He,Gengfa Fang,Chengpei Xu,Feng Xia,Wenjing Jia

Healthcare monitoring is crucial, especially for the daily care of elderly
individuals living alone. It can detect dangerous occurrences, such as falls,
and provide timely alerts to save lives. Non-invasive millimeter wave (mmWave)
radar-based healthcare monitoring systems using advanced human activity
recognition (HAR) models have recently gained significant attention. However,
they encounter challenges in handling sparse point clouds, achieving real-time
continuous classification, and coping with limited monitoring ranges when
statically mounted. To overcome these limitations, we propose RobHAR, a movable
robot-mounted mmWave radar system with lightweight deep neural networks for
real-time monitoring of human activities. Specifically, we first propose a
sparse point cloud-based global embedding to learn the features of point clouds
using the light-PointNet (LPN) backbone. Then, we learn the temporal pattern
with a bidirectional lightweight LSTM model (BiLiLSTM). In addition, we
implement a transition optimization strategy, integrating the Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to improve the
accuracy and robustness of the continuous HAR. Our experiments on three
datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the previous
studies in both discrete and continuous HAR tasks. Finally, we deploy our
system on a movable robot-mounted edge computing platform, achieving flexible
healthcare monitoring in real-world scenarios.

##### **Exploiting ChatGPT for Diagnosing Autism-Associated Language Disorders and Identifying Distinct Features**
2405.01799v1 by Chuanbo Hu,Wenqi Li,Mindi Ruan,Xiangxu Yu,Lynn K. Paul,Shuo Wang,Xin Li

Diagnosing language disorders associated with autism is a complex and nuanced
challenge, often hindered by the subjective nature and variability of
traditional assessment methods. Traditional diagnostic methods not only require
intensive human effort but also often result in delayed interventions due to
their lack of speed and specificity. In this study, we explored the application
of ChatGPT, a state of the art large language model, to overcome these
obstacles by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and profiling specific linguistic
features indicative of autism. Leveraging ChatGPT advanced natural language
processing capabilities, this research aims to streamline and refine the
diagnostic process. Specifically, we compared ChatGPT's performance with that
of conventional supervised learning models, including BERT, a model acclaimed
for its effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We showed
that ChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 13%
improvement in both accuracy and F1 score in a zero shot learning
configuration. This marked enhancement highlights the model potential as a
superior tool for neurological diagnostics. Additionally, we identified ten
distinct features of autism associated language disorders that vary
significantly across different experimental scenarios. These features, which
included echolalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage, were crucial
for accurately diagnosing ASD and customizing treatment plans. Together, our
findings advocate for adopting sophisticated AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical
settings to assess and diagnose developmental disorders. Our approach not only
promises greater diagnostic precision but also aligns with the goals of
personalized medicine, potentially transforming the evaluation landscape for
autism and similar neurological conditions.

##### **Interpretable Vital Sign Forecasting with Model Agnostic Attention Maps**
2405.01714v2 by Yuwei Liu,Chen Dan,Anubhav Bhatti,Bingjie Shen,Divij Gupta,Suraj Parmar,San Lee

Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs),
representing a substantial medical challenge. The complexity of analyzing
diverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep
learning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their
'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in
critical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a
deep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical
time steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability
and supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism
could be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as
N-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep
learning models while enhancing interpretability through
attention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD
dataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed
its performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW)
metrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the
differences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing
vital sign forecasting.

##### **Long Tail Image Generation Through Feature Space Augmentation and Iterated Learning**
2405.01705v1 by Rafael Elberg,Denis Parra,Mircea Petrache

Image and multimodal machine learning tasks are very challenging to solve in
the case of poorly distributed data. In particular, data availability and
privacy restrictions exacerbate these hurdles in the medical domain. The state
of the art in image generation quality is held by Latent Diffusion models,
making them prime candidates for tackling this problem. However, a few key
issues still need to be solved, such as the difficulty in generating data from
under-represented classes and a slow inference process. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a new method for image augmentation in long-tailed data
based on leveraging the rich latent space of pre-trained Stable Diffusion
Models. We create a modified separable latent space to mix head and tail class
examples. We build this space via Iterated Learning of underlying sparsified
embeddings, which we apply to task-specific saliency maps via a K-NN approach.

##### **Automatically Extracting Numerical Results from Randomized Controlled Trials with Large Language Models**
2405.01686v1 by Hye Sun Yun,David Pogrebitskiy,Iain J. Marshall,Byron C. Wallace

Meta-analyses statistically aggregate the findings of different randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) to assess treatment effectiveness. Because this yields
robust estimates of treatment effectiveness, results from meta-analyses are
considered the strongest form of evidence. However, rigorous evidence syntheses
are time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring manual extraction of data
from individual trials to be synthesized. Ideally, language technologies would
permit fully automatic meta-analysis, on demand. This requires accurately
extracting numerical results from individual trials, which has been beyond the
capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) models to date. In this work,
we evaluate whether modern large language models (LLMs) can reliably perform
this task. We annotate (and release) a modest but granular evaluation dataset
of clinical trial reports with numerical findings attached to interventions,
comparators, and outcomes. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of
seven LLMs applied zero-shot for the task of conditionally extracting numerical
findings from trial reports. We find that massive LLMs that can accommodate
lengthy inputs are tantalizingly close to realizing fully automatic
meta-analysis, especially for dichotomous (binary) outcomes (e.g., mortality).
However, LLMs -- including ones trained on biomedical texts -- perform poorly
when the outcome measures are complex and tallying the results requires
inference. This work charts a path toward fully automatic meta-analysis of RCTs
via LLMs, while also highlighting the limitations of existing models for this
aim.

##### **Leveraging Prompt-Learning for Structured Information Extraction from Crohn's Disease Radiology Reports in a Low-Resource Language**
2405.01682v1 by Liam Hazan,Gili Focht,Naama Gavrielov,Roi Reichart,Talar Hagopian,Mary-Louise C. Greer,Ruth Cytter Kuint,Dan Turner,Moti Freiman

Automatic conversion of free-text radiology reports into structured data
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is crucial for analyzing
diseases on a large scale. While effective for tasks in widely spoken languages
like English, generative large language models (LLMs) typically underperform
with less common languages and can pose potential risks to patient privacy.
Fine-tuning local NLP models is hindered by the skewed nature of real-world
medical datasets, where rare findings represent a significant data imbalance.
We introduce SMP-BERT, a novel prompt learning method that leverages the
structured nature of reports to overcome these challenges. In our studies
involving a substantial collection of Crohn's disease radiology reports in
Hebrew (over 8,000 patients and 10,000 reports), SMP-BERT greatly surpassed
traditional fine-tuning methods in performance, notably in detecting infrequent
conditions (AUC: 0.99 vs 0.94, F1: 0.84 vs 0.34). SMP-BERT empowers more
accurate AI diagnostics available for low-resource languages.

AI Foundation models are gaining traction in various applications, including
medical fields like radiology. However, medical foundation models are often
tested on limited tasks, leaving their generalisability and biases unexplored.
We present RayDINO, a large visual encoder trained by self-supervision on 873k
chest X-rays. We compare RayDINO to previous state-of-the-art models across
nine radiology tasks, from classification and dense segmentation to text
generation, and provide an in depth analysis of population, age and sex biases
of our model. Our findings suggest that self-supervision allows patient-centric
AI proving useful in clinical workflows and interpreting X-rays holistically.
With RayDINO and small task-specific adapters, we reach state-of-the-art
results and improve generalization to unseen populations while mitigating bias,
illustrating the true promise of foundation models: versatility and robustness.

##### **DMON: A Simple yet Effective Approach for Argument Structure Learning**
2405.01216v1 by Wei Sun,Mingxiao Li,Jingyuan Sun,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens

Argument structure learning~(ASL) entails predicting relations between
arguments. Because it can structure a document to facilitate its understanding,
it has been widely applied in many fields~(medical, commercial, and scientific
domains). Despite its broad utilization, ASL remains a challenging task because
it involves examining the complex relationships between the sentences in a
potentially unstructured discourse. To resolve this problem, we have developed
a simple yet effective approach called Dual-tower Multi-scale cOnvolution
neural Network~(DMON) for the ASL task. Specifically, we organize arguments
into a relationship matrix that together with the argument embeddings forms a
relationship tensor and design a mechanism to capture relations with contextual
arguments. Experimental results on three different-domain argument mining
datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models.
The code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/DMON.git .

##### **Beyond Human Vision: The Role of Large Vision Language Models in Microscope Image Analysis**
2405.00876v1 by Prateek Verma,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu

Vision language models (VLMs) have recently emerged and gained the spotlight
for their ability to comprehend the dual modality of image and textual data.
VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini have recently shown impressive
performance on tasks such as natural image captioning, visual question
answering (VQA), and spatial reasoning. Additionally, a universal segmentation
model by Meta AI, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows unprecedented performance
at isolating objects from unforeseen images. Since medical experts, biologists,
and materials scientists routinely examine microscopy or medical images in
conjunction with textual information in the form of captions, literature, or
reports, and draw conclusions of great importance and merit, it is indubitably
essential to test the performance of VLMs and foundation models such as SAM, on
these images. In this study, we charge ChatGPT, LLaVA, Gemini, and SAM with
classification, segmentation, counting, and VQA tasks on a variety of
microscopy images. We observe that ChatGPT and Gemini are impressively able to
comprehend the visual features in microscopy images, while SAM is quite capable
at isolating artefacts in a general sense. However, the performance is not
close to that of a domain expert - the models are readily encumbered by the
introduction of impurities, defects, artefact overlaps and diversity present in
the images.

##### **"I'm Not Sure, But...": Examining the Impact of Large Language Models' Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust**
2405.00623v1 by Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Q. Vera Liao,Mihaela Vorvoreanu,Stephanie Ballard,Jennifer Wortman Vaughan

Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet
incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they
were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to
communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little
empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of
uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered,
human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions
with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine.
Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different
natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance,
trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions
(e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system
and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants'
accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed
to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While
we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective
(e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not
statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language
expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing
overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This
highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.

##### **Enhancing Surgical Robots with Embodied Intelligence for Autonomous Ultrasound Scanning**
2405.00461v1 by Huan Xu,Jinlin Wu,Guanglin Cao,Zhen Lei,Zhen Chen,Hongbin Liu

Ultrasound robots are increasingly used in medical diagnostics and early
disease screening. However, current ultrasound robots lack the intelligence to
understand human intentions and instructions, hindering autonomous ultrasound
scanning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Ultrasound Embodied
Intelligence system that equips ultrasound robots with the large language model
(LLM) and domain knowledge, thereby improving the efficiency of ultrasound
robots. Specifically, we first design an ultrasound operation knowledge
database to add expertise in ultrasound scanning to the LLM, enabling the LLM
to perform precise motion planning. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic ultrasound
scanning strategy based on a \textit{think-observe-execute} prompt engineering,
allowing LLMs to dynamically adjust motion planning strategies during the
scanning procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly improves ultrasound scan efficiency and quality from verbal
commands. This advancement in autonomous medical scanning technology
contributes to non-invasive diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many
benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that
some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data
closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of
true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission
Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and
complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring
elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are
comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps
in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and
closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with
several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of
systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many
models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show
minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship
(Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example
from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that
many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.

##### **Active Learning with Task Adaptation Pre-training for Speech Emotion Recognition**
2405.00307v1 by Dongyuan Li,Ying Zhang,Yusong Wang,Funakoshi Kataro,Manabu Okumura

Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its
wide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine
interaction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance. However,
existing SER methods often overlook the information gap between the
pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in
sub-optimal performance. Moreover, current methods require much time for
fine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data. To
address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning
framework for SER, called \textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation
pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency.
Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the
pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion
recognition task. Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset
of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing
time consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
\textsc{After}, using only 20\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\% and
reduces time consumption by 79\%. The additional extension of \textsc{After}
and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to
various real-world scenarios. Our source code is available on Github for
reproducibility. (https://github.com/Clearloveyuan/AFTER).

##### **Quantifying Nematodes through Images: Datasets, Models, and Baselines of Deep Learning**
2404.19748v1 by Zhipeng Yuan,Nasamu Musa,Katarzyna Dybal,Matthew Back,Daniel Leybourne,Po Yang

Every year, plant parasitic nematodes, one of the major groups of plant
pathogens, cause a significant loss of crops worldwide. To mitigate crop yield
losses caused by nematodes, an efficient nematode monitoring method is
essential for plant and crop disease management. In other respects, efficient
nematode detection contributes to medical research and drug discovery, as
nematodes are model organisms. With the rapid development of computer
technology, computer vision techniques provide a feasible solution for
quantifying nematodes or nematode infections. In this paper, we survey and
categorise the studies and available datasets on nematode detection through
deep-learning models. To stimulate progress in related research, this survey
presents the potential state-of-the-art object detection models, training
techniques, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics for deep learning
beginners. Moreover, seven state-of-the-art object detection models are
validated on three public datasets and the AgriNema dataset for plant parasitic
nematodes to construct a baseline for nematode detection.

##### **Data Set Terminology of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: A Historical Review and Recommendation**
2404.19303v1 by Shannon L. Walston,Hiroshi Seki,Hirotaka Takita,Yasuhito Mitsuyama,Shingo Sato,Akifumi Hagiwara,Rintaro Ito,Shouhei Hanaoka,Yukio Miki,Daiju Ueda

Medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) engineering represent two distinct
fields each with decades of published history. With such history comes a set of
terminology that has a specific way in which it is applied. However, when two
distinct fields with overlapping terminology start to collaborate,
miscommunication and misunderstandings can occur. This narrative review aims to
give historical context for these terms, accentuate the importance of clarity
when these terms are used in medical AI contexts, and offer solutions to
mitigate misunderstandings by readers from either field. Through an examination
of historical documents, including articles, writing guidelines, and textbooks,
this review traces the divergent evolution of terms for data sets and their
impact. Initially, the discordant interpretations of the word 'validation' in
medical and AI contexts are explored. Then the data sets used for AI evaluation
are classified, namely random splitting, cross-validation, temporal,
geographic, internal, and external sets. The accurate and standardized
description of these data sets is crucial for demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of AI applications in medicine. This review clarifies existing
literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of these classifications
and their implications in AI evaluation. This review then identifies often
misunderstood terms and proposes pragmatic solutions to mitigate terminological
confusion. Among these solutions are the use of standardized terminology such
as 'training set,' 'validation (or tuning) set,' and 'test set,' and explicit
definition of data set splitting terminologies in each medical AI research
publication. This review aspires to enhance the precision of communication in
medical AI, thereby fostering more effective and transparent research
methodologies in this interdisciplinary field.

##### **Text and Audio Simplification: Human vs. ChatGPT**
2405.01592v1 by Gondy Leroy,David Kauchak,Philip Harber,Ankit Pal,Akash Shukla

Text and audio simplification to increase information comprehension are
important in healthcare. With the introduction of ChatGPT, an evaluation of its
simplification performance is needed. We provide a systematic comparison of
human and ChatGPT simplified texts using fourteen metrics indicative of text
difficulty. We briefly introduce our online editor where these simplification
tools, including ChatGPT, are available. We scored twelve corpora using our
metrics: six text, one audio, and five ChatGPT simplified corpora. We then
compare these corpora with texts simplified and verified in a prior user study.
Finally, a medical domain expert evaluated these texts and five, new ChatGPT
simplified versions. We found that simple corpora show higher similarity with
the human simplified texts. ChatGPT simplification moves metrics in the right
direction. The medical domain expert evaluation showed a preference for the
ChatGPT style, but the text itself was rated lower for content retention.

##### **ConPro: Learning Severity Representation for Medical Images using Contrastive Learning and Preference Optimization**
2404.18831v1 by Hong Nguyen,Hoang Nguyen,Melinda Chang,Hieu Pham,Shrikanth Narayanan,Michael Pazzani

Understanding the severity of conditions shown in images in medical diagnosis
is crucial, serving as a key guide for clinical assessment, treatment, as well
as evaluating longitudinal progression. This paper proposes Con- PrO: a novel
representation learning method for severity assessment in medical images using
Contrastive learningintegrated Preference Optimization. Different from
conventional contrastive learning methods that maximize the distance between
classes, ConPrO injects into the latent vector the distance preference
knowledge between various severity classes and the normal class. We
systematically examine the key components of our framework to illuminate how
contrastive prediction tasks acquire valuable representations. We show that our
representation learning framework offers valuable severity ordering in the
feature space while outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on
classification tasks. We achieve a 6% and 20% relative improvement compared to
a supervised and a self-supervised baseline, respectively. In addition, we
derived discussions on severity indicators and related applications of
preference comparison in the medical domain.

##### **Decoding Radiologists' Intentions: A Novel System for Accurate Region Identification in Chest X-ray Image Analysis**
2404.18981v1 by Akash Awasthi,Safwan Ahmad,Bryant Le,Hien Van Nguyen

In the realm of chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, radiologists meticulously
examine various regions, documenting their observations in reports. The
prevalence of errors in CXR diagnoses, particularly among inexperienced
radiologists and hospital residents, underscores the importance of
understanding radiologists' intentions and the corresponding regions of
interest. This understanding is crucial for correcting mistakes by guiding
radiologists to the accurate regions of interest, especially in the diagnosis
of chest radiograph abnormalities. In response to this imperative, we propose a
novel system designed to identify the primary intentions articulated by
radiologists in their reports and the corresponding regions of interest in CXR
images. This system seeks to elucidate the visual context underlying
radiologists' textual findings, with the potential to rectify errors made by
less experienced practitioners and direct them to precise regions of interest.
Importantly, the proposed system can be instrumental in providing constructive
feedback to inexperienced radiologists or junior residents in the hospital,
bridging the gap in face-to-face communication. The system represents a
valuable tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and fostering continuous
learning within the medical community.

##### **Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence**
2404.18976v1 by Paul Pu Liang

Building multisensory AI systems that learn from multiple sensory inputs such
as text, speech, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data
holds great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical
benefits, such as in supporting human health and well-being, enabling
multimedia content processing, and enhancing real-world autonomous agents. By
synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this
thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In
the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities
interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These
interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and
their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets,
design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether
their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design
of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities
and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to
real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale
benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas,
followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures
that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these
architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose
multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying
these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health,
cancer prognosis, and robotics. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing
how future work can leverage these ideas toward more general, interactive, and
safe multisensory AI.

##### **M3H: Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare**
2404.18975v1 by Dimitris Bertsimas,Yu Ma

Recent breakthroughs in AI are poised to fundamentally enhance our study and
understanding of healthcare. The development of an integrated many-to-many
framework that leverages multiple data modality inputs for the analytical
modeling of multiple medical tasks, is critical for a unified understanding of
modern medicine. In this work, we introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal
Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning
from diverse multimodal inputs across a broad spectrum of medical task
categories and machine learning problem classes. The modular design of the
framework ensures its generalizable data processing, task definition, and rapid
model prototyping, applicable to both clinical and operational healthcare
settings. We evaluate the M3H framework by validating models trained from four
modalities (tabular, time-series, language, and vision) on 41 medical tasks
across 4 machine learning problem classes. Our results demonstrate that M3H
consistently produces multitask models that outperform canonical single-task
models (by 1.1- 37.2%) across 37 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments,
three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task: spanning
ML problem classes of supervised binary classification, multiclass
classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally, the framework
introduces a novel attention mechanism to balance self-exploitation (focus on
learning source task), and cross-exploration (encourage learning from other
tasks). Furthermore, M3H provides explainability insights on how joint learning
of additional tasks impacts the learning of source task using a proposed TIM
score, shedding light into the dynamics of task interdependencies. Its
adaptable architecture facilitates the customization and integration,
establishing it as a robust and scalable candidate solution for future
AI-driven healthcare systems.

##### **Real Time Multi Organ Classification on Computed Tomography Images**
2404.18731v1 by Halid Ziya Yerebakan,Yoshihisa Shinagawa,Gerardo Hermosillo Valadez

Organ segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging, and it is useful
for many clinical automation pipelines. Typically, the process involves
segmenting the entire volume, which can be unnecessary when the points of
interest are limited. In those cases, a classifier could be used instead of
segmentation. However, there is an inherent trade-off between the context size
and the speed of classifiers. To address this issue, we propose a new method
that employs a data selection strategy with sparse sampling across a wide field
of view without image resampling. This sparse sampling strategy makes it
possible to classify voxels into multiple organs in real time without using
accelerators. Although our method is an independent classifier, it can generate
full segmentation by querying grid locations at any resolution. We have
compared our method with existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating its
potential for superior runtime in practical applications in medical imaging.

##### **Simplifying Multimodality: Unimodal Approach to Multimodal Challenges in Radiology with General-Domain Large Language Model**
2405.01591v1 by Seonhee Cho,Choonghan Kim,Jiho Lee,Chetan Chilkunda,Sujin Choi,Joo Heung Yoon

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have attracted interest
in their generalization capability with only a few samples in the prompt. This
progress is particularly relevant to the medical domain, where the quality and
sensitivity of data pose unique challenges for model training and application.
However, the dependency on high-quality data for effective in-context learning
raises questions about the feasibility of these models when encountering with
the inevitable variations and errors inherent in real-world medical data. In
this paper, we introduce MID-M, a novel framework that leverages the in-context
learning capabilities of a general-domain Large Language Model (LLM) to process
multimodal data via image descriptions. MID-M achieves a comparable or superior
performance to task-specific fine-tuned LMMs and other general-domain ones,
without the extensive domain-specific training or pre-training on multimodal
data, with significantly fewer parameters. This highlights the potential of
leveraging general-domain LLMs for domain-specific tasks and offers a
sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional LMM developments.
Moreover, the robustness of MID-M against data quality issues demonstrates its
practical utility in real-world medical domain applications.

##### **Machine Learning for Quantum Computing Specialists**
2404.18555v1 by Daniel Goldsmith,M M Hassan Mahmud

Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising early use case for quantum
computing. There has been progress in the last five years from theoretical
studies and numerical simulations to proof of concepts. Use cases demonstrated
on contemporary quantum devices include classifying medical images and items
from the Iris dataset, classifying and generating handwritten images, toxicity
screening, and learning a probability distribution. Potential benefits of QML
include faster training and identification of feature maps not found
classically. Although, these examples lack the scale for commercial
exploitation, and it may be several years before QML algorithms replace the
classical solutions, QML is an exciting area.
  This article is written for those who already have a sound knowledge of
quantum computing and now wish to gain a basic overview of the terminology and
some applications of classical machine learning ready to study quantum machine
learning. The reader will already understand the relevant relevant linear
algebra, including Hilbert spaces, a vector space with an inner product.

##### **GPT-4 passes most of the 297 written Polish Board Certification Examinations**
2405.01589v1 by Jakub Pokrywka,Jeremi Kaczmarek,Edward Gorzelańczyk

Introduction: Recently, the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
increased rapidly, allowing them to be used in a great number of applications.
However, the risks posed by the generation of false information through LLMs
significantly limit their applications in sensitive areas such as healthcare,
highlighting the necessity for rigorous validations to determine their utility
and reliability. To date, no study has extensively compared the performance of
LLMs on Polish medical examinations across a broad spectrum of specialties on a
very large dataset. Objectives: This study evaluated the performance of three
Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models on the Polish Board
Certification Exam (Pa\'nstwowy Egzamin Specjalizacyjny, PES) dataset, which
consists of 297 tests. Methods: We developed a software program to download and
process PES exams and tested the performance of GPT models using OpenAI
Application Programming Interface. Results: Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5
did not pass any of the analyzed exams. In contrast, the GPT-4 models
demonstrated the capability to pass the majority of the exams evaluated, with
the most recent model, gpt-4-0125, successfully passing 222 (75%) of them. The
performance of the GPT models varied significantly, displaying excellence in
exams related to certain specialties while completely failing others.
Conclusions: The significant progress and impressive performance of LLM models
hold great promise for the increased application of AI in the field of medicine
in Poland. For instance, this advancement could lead to the development of
AI-based medical assistants for healthcare professionals, enhancing the
efficiency and accuracy of medical services.

##### **On the Impact of Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning Environments with Application to Healthcare Networks**
2404.18519v2 by Usevalad Milasheuski. Luca Barbieri,Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini,Monica Nicoli,Stefano Savazzi

Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple privacy-sensitive applications to
leverage their dataset for a global model construction without any disclosure
of the information. One of those domains is healthcare, where groups of silos
collaborate in order to generate a global predictor with improved accuracy and
generalization. However, the inherent challenge lies in the high heterogeneity
of medical data, necessitating sophisticated techniques for assessment and
compensation. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the
mathematical formalization and taxonomy of heterogeneity within FL
environments, focusing on the intricacies of medical data. In particular, we
address the evaluation and comparison of the most popular FL algorithms with
respect to their ability to cope with quantity-based, feature and label
distribution-based heterogeneity. The goal is to provide a quantitative
evaluation of the impact of data heterogeneity in FL systems for healthcare
networks as well as a guideline on FL algorithm selection. Our research extends
beyond existing studies by benchmarking seven of the most common FL algorithms
against the unique challenges posed by medical data use cases. The paper
targets the prediction of the risk of stroke recurrence through a set of
tabular clinical reports collected by different federated hospital silos: data
heterogeneity frequently encountered in this scenario and its impact on FL
performance are discussed.

This paper combines Struts and Hibernate two architectures together, using
DAO (Data Access Object) to store and access data. Then a set of dual-mode
humidity medical image library suitable for deep network is established, and a
dual-mode medical image assisted diagnosis method based on the image is
proposed. Through the test of various feature extraction methods, the optimal
operating characteristic under curve product (AUROC) is 0.9985, the recall rate
is 0.9814, and the accuracy is 0.9833. This method can be applied to clinical
diagnosis, and it is a practical method. Any outpatient doctor can register
quickly through the system, or log in to the platform to upload the image to
obtain more accurate images. Through the system, each outpatient physician can
quickly register or log in to the platform for image uploading, thus obtaining
more accurate images. The segmentation of images can guide doctors in clinical
departments. Then the image is analyzed to determine the location and nature of
the tumor, so as to make targeted treatment.

Excellence in a wide variety of medical applications poses considerable
challenges for AI, requiring advanced reasoning, access to up-to-date medical
knowledge and understanding of complex multimodal data. Gemini models, with
strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning, offer
exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini,
we introduce Med-Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that are
specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search, and that
can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We
evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance on 10 of them, and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every
benchmark where a direct comparison is viable, often by a wide margin. On the
popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves
SoTA performance of 91.1% accuracy, using a novel uncertainty-guided search
strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU
(health & medicine), Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative
margin of 44.5%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Gemini's long-context
capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task
from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering,
surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally,
Med-Gemini's performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human
experts on tasks such as medical text summarization, alongside demonstrations
of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue, medical research and
education. Taken together, our results offer compelling evidence for
Med-Gemini's potential, although further rigorous evaluation will be crucial
before real-world deployment in this safety-critical domain.

##### **Permutation-equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks**
2404.18198v1 by Sreetama Das,Filippo Caruso

The Symmetric group $S_{n}$ manifests itself in large classes of quantum
systems as the invariance of certain characteristics of a quantum state with
respect to permuting the qubits. The subgroups of $S_{n}$ arise, among many
other contexts, to describe label symmetry of classical images with respect to
spatial transformations, e.g. reflection or rotation. Equipped with the
formalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this work we propose the
architectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs)
adherent to $S_{n}$ and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of
pixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for
small subgroups of $S_{n}$. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the
full permutation group $S_{n}$ is built by applying all possible QCNNs with
equal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in
quantum neural networks. For subgroups of $S_{n}$, our numerical results using
MNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs.
The $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training
and test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected
and non-connected graphs. When trained with sufficiently large number of data,
the $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN shows better average performance compared to
$S_{n}$-equivariant QNN . These results contribute towards building powerful
quantum machine learning architectures in permutation-symmetric systems.

##### **MediFact at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Why AI Needs a Human Touch**
2404.17999v1 by Nadia Saeed

Accurate representation of medical information is crucial for patient safety,
yet artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
encounter challenges in error-free clinical text interpretation. This paper
presents a novel approach submitted to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task (Ben
Abacha et al., 2024a), focusing on the automatic correction of single-word
errors in clinical notes. Unlike LLMs that rely on extensive generic data, our
method emphasizes extracting contextually relevant information from available
clinical text data. Leveraging an ensemble of extractive and abstractive
question-answering approaches, we construct a supervised learning framework
with domain-specific feature engineering. Our methodology incorporates domain
expertise to enhance error correction accuracy. By integrating domain expertise
and prioritizing meaningful information extraction, our approach underscores
the significance of a human-centric strategy in adapting AI for healthcare.

##### **MediFact at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Medical Question Answering in Dermatology with Multimodal Learning**
2405.01583v1 by Nadia Saeed

The MEDIQA-M3G 2024 challenge necessitates novel solutions for Multilingual &
Multimodal Medical Answer Generation in dermatology (wai Yim et al., 2024a).
This paper addresses the limitations of traditional methods by proposing a
weakly supervised learning approach for open-ended medical question-answering
(QA). Our system leverages readily available MEDIQA-M3G images via a
VGG16-CNN-SVM model, enabling multilingual (English, Chinese, Spanish) learning
of informative skin condition representations. Using pre-trained QA models, we
further bridge the gap between visual and textual information through
multimodal fusion. This approach tackles complex, open-ended questions even
without predefined answer choices. We empower the generation of comprehensive
answers by feeding the ViT-CLIP model with multiple responses alongside images.
This work advances medical QA research, paving the way for clinical decision
support systems and ultimately improving healthcare delivery.

##### **Advancing Healthcare Automation: Multi-Agent Systems for Medical Necessity Justification**
2404.17977v1 by Himanshu Pandey,Akhil Amod,Shivang

This paper explores the application of Swarm-Structured Multi-Agent Systems
(MAS) to establish medical necessity, a process that involves a systematic
review of patient-specific medical structured and unstructured data against
clinical guidelines. We addressed this complex task by decomposing it into
smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is handled by a specialized
AI agent. We conduct a systematic study of the impact of various prompting
strategies on these agents and benchmark different Large Language Models (LLMs)
to determine their accuracy in completing these tasks. Additionally, we
investigate how these agents can provide explainability, thereby enhancing
trust and transparency within the system.

##### **Pre-training on High Definition X-ray Images: An Experimental Study**
2404.17926v1 by Xiao Wang,Yuehang Li,Wentao Wu,Jiandong Jin,Yao Rong,Bo Jiang,Chuanfu Li,Jin Tang

Existing X-ray based pre-trained vision models are usually conducted on a
relatively small-scale dataset (less than 500k samples) with limited resolution
(e.g., 224 $\times$ 224). However, the key to the success of self-supervised
pre-training large models lies in massive training data, and maintaining high
resolution in the field of X-ray images is the guarantee of effective solutions
to difficult miscellaneous diseases. In this paper, we address these issues by
proposing the first high-definition (1280 $\times$ 1280) X-ray based
pre-trained foundation vision model on our newly collected large-scale dataset
which contains more than 1 million X-ray images. Our model follows the masked
auto-encoder framework which takes the tokens after mask processing (with a
high rate) is used as input, and the masked image patches are reconstructed by
the Transformer encoder-decoder network. More importantly, we introduce a novel
context-aware masking strategy that utilizes the chest contour as a boundary
for adaptive masking operations. We validate the effectiveness of our model on
two downstream tasks, including X-ray report generation and disease
recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained medical
foundation vision model achieves comparable or even new state-of-the-art
performance on downstream benchmark datasets. The source code and pre-trained
models of this paper will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

##### **SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models**
2404.17912v1 by Manav Nitin Kapadnis,Sohan Patnaik,Abhilash Nandy,Sourjyadip Ray,Pawan Goyal,Debdoot Sheet

Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent
radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based
reports that don't accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we
introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort
GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by
integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a
unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image
representations and the contextual representations of the generated
radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective,
to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and
align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and
the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing
nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as
LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and
Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust
against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant
advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening
paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical
imaging domain.

##### **GLIMS: Attention-Guided Lightweight Multi-Scale Hybrid Network for Volumetric Semantic Segmentation**
2404.17854v1 by Ziya Ata Yazıcı,İlkay Öksüz,Hazım Kemal Ekenel

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted for medical
image segmentation tasks, demonstrating promising performance. However, the
inherent inductive biases in convolutional architectures limit their ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial correlations. While recent
transformer-based architectures address these limitations by leveraging
self-attention mechanisms to encode long-range dependencies and learn
expressive representations, they often struggle to extract low-level features
and are highly dependent on data availability. This motivated us for the
development of GLIMS, a data-efficient attention-guided hybrid volumetric
segmentation network. GLIMS utilizes Dilated Feature Aggregator Convolutional
Blocks (DACB) to capture local-global feature correlations efficiently.
Furthermore, the incorporated Swin Transformer-based bottleneck bridges the
local and global features to improve the robustness of the model. Additionally,
GLIMS employs an attention-guided segmentation approach through Channel and
Spatial-Wise Attention Blocks (CSAB) to localize expressive features for
fine-grained border segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results on
glioblastoma and multi-organ CT segmentation tasks demonstrate GLIMS'

##### **Multimodal Fusion on Low-quality Data: A Comprehensive Survey**
2404.18947v2 by Qingyang Zhang,Yake Wei,Zongbo Han,Huazhu Fu,Xi Peng,Cheng Deng,Qinghua Hu,Cai Xu,Jie Wen,Di Hu,Changqing Zhang

Multimodal fusion focuses on integrating information from multiple modalities
with the goal of more accurate prediction, which has achieved remarkable
progress in a wide range of scenarios, including autonomous driving and medical
diagnosis. However, the reliability of multimodal fusion remains largely
unexplored especially under low-quality data settings. This paper surveys the
common challenges and recent advances of multimodal fusion in the wild and
presents them in a comprehensive taxonomy. From a data-centric view, we
identify four main challenges that are faced by multimodal fusion on
low-quality data, namely (1) noisy multimodal data that are contaminated with
heterogeneous noises, (2) incomplete multimodal data that some modalities are
missing, (3) imbalanced multimodal data that the qualities or properties of
different modalities are significantly different and (4) quality-varying
multimodal data that the quality of each modality dynamically changes with
respect to different samples. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to
understand the state of the field and identify several potential directions. We
also provide discussion for the open problems in this field together with
interesting future research directions.

##### **Evaluating the Application of ChatGPT in Outpatient Triage Guidance: A Comparative Study**
2405.00728v1 by Dou Liu,Ying Han,Xiandi Wang,Xiaomei Tan,Di Liu,Guangwu Qian,Kang Li,Dan Pu,Rong Yin

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a
transformative potential for enhancing operational efficiency and health
outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their
capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical
systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential
of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been
examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient
departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency
for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency
of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both
within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For
within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for
ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a
moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top
recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low
(mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match
between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in
the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be
complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences
in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The
findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also
facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in
healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs
and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors
principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient
triage.

##### **UMass-BioNLP at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: DermPrompt -- A Systematic Exploration of Prompt Engineering with GPT-4V for Dermatological Diagnosis**
2404.17749v1 by Parth Vashisht,Abhilasha Lodha,Mukta Maddipatla,Zonghai Yao,Avijit Mitra,Zhichao Yang,Junda Wang,Sunjae Kwon,Hong Yu

This paper presents our team's participation in the MEDIQA-ClinicalNLP2024
shared task B. We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology
cases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the
capabilities of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our
investigation reveals that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can
accurately retrieve the correct skin condition 85% of the time using
dermatological images and brief patient histories. Additionally, we empirically
show that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) works well for retrieval while Medical
Guidelines Grounded CoT is required for accurate dermatological diagnosis.
Further, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework and show its
superior performance and potential over the best CoT strategy. The experiments
suggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent conversation for
critique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate diagnosis of
dermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to improving
diagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing
patient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.

##### **Rad4XCNN: a new agnostic method for post-hoc global explanation of CNN-derived features by means of radiomics**
2405.02334v1 by Francesco Prinzi,Carmelo Militello,Calogero Zarcaro,Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta,Salvatore Gaglio,Salvatore Vitabile

In the last years, artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical decision support
systems (CDSS) played a key role in harnessing machine learning and deep
learning architectures. Despite their promising capabilities, the lack of
transparency and explainability of AI models poses significant challenges,
particularly in medical contexts where reliability is a mandatory aspect.
Achieving transparency without compromising predictive accuracy remains a key
challenge. This paper presents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the
predictive power of CNN-derived features with the interpretability inherent in
radiomic features. Rad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on
saliency map, by associating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by
means of Radiomics, offering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond
visualization maps. Using a breast cancer classification task as a case study,
we evaluated Rad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online
dataset and two in-house datasets for internal and external validation. Some
key results are: i) CNN-derived features guarantee more robust accuracy when
compared against ViT-derived and radiomic features; ii) conventional
visualization map methods for explanation present several pitfalls; iii)
Rad4XCNN does not sacrifice model accuracy for their explainability; iv)
Rad4XCNN provides global explanation insights enabling the physician to analyze
the model outputs and findings. In addition, we highlight the importance of
integrating interpretability into AI models for enhanced trust and adoption in
clinical practice, emphasizing how our method can mitigate some concerns
related to explainable AI methods.

##### **Domain Adaptive and Fine-grained Anomaly Detection for Single-cell Sequencing Data and Beyond**
2404.17454v2 by Kaichen Xu,Yueyang Ding,Suyang Hou,Weiqiang Zhan,Nisang Chen,Jun Wang,Xiaobo Sun

Fined-grained anomalous cell detection from affected tissues is critical for
clinical diagnosis and pathological research. Single-cell sequencing data
provide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly
detection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample
and multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal
performance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous
cells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth,
a novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates
the detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous
cells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first
theoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative
models for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us
to develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer
in ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types
of tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain
contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/ACsleuth.

##### **M3BAT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multimodal Mobile Sensing with Multi-Branch Adversarial Training**
2404.17391v1 by Lakmal Meegahapola,Hamza Hassoune,Daniel Gatica-Perez

Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for
inferences regarding health and well being, behavior, and context. However, a
significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in
real world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon
where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the
distribution of data in the real world, the deployment environment. While
extensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and
while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current
work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such
as audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research
on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To
address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural
networks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in
multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN,
called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with
multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor
data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive
experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three
inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression
and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on
unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source
domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12%
AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on
classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression
tasks.

##### **Prevalent Frequency of Emotional and Physical Symptoms in Social Anxiety using Zero Shot Classification: An Observational Study**
2404.17183v1 by Muhammad Rizwan,Jure Demšar

Social anxiety represents a prevalent challenge in modern society, affecting
individuals across personal and professional spheres. Left unaddressed, this
condition can yield substantial negative consequences, impacting social
interactions and performance. Further understanding its diverse physical and
emotional symptoms becomes pivotal for comprehensive diagnosis and tailored
therapeutic interventions. This study analyze prevalence and frequency of
social anxiety symptoms taken from Mayo Clinic, exploring diverse human
experiences from utilizing a large Reddit dataset dedicated to this issue.
Leveraging these platforms, the research aims to extract insights and examine a
spectrum of physical and emotional symptoms linked to social anxiety disorder.
Upholding ethical considerations, the study maintains strict user anonymity
within the dataset. By employing a novel approach, the research utilizes
BART-based multi-label zero-shot classification to identify and measure symptom
prevalence and significance in the form of probability score for each symptom
under consideration. Results uncover distinctive patterns: "Trembling" emerges
as a prevalent physical symptom, while emotional symptoms like "Fear of being
judged negatively" exhibit high frequencies. These findings offer insights into
the multifaceted nature of social anxiety, aiding clinical practices and
interventions tailored to its diverse expressions.

##### **Deep Evidential Learning for Dose Prediction**
2404.17126v1 by Hai Siong Tan,Kuancheng Wang,Rafe Mcbeth

In this work, we present a novel application of an uncertainty-quantification
framework called Deep Evidential Learning in the domain of radiotherapy dose
prediction. Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge
dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield
uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon
completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the
original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic
uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various
association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout
and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty
threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential
Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a
more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to
epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant
shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity,
compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our
results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can
endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical
robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can
use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence
intervals.

##### **Attributing Responsibility in AI-Induced Incidents: A Computational Reflective Equilibrium Framework for Accountability**
2404.16957v1 by Yunfei Ge,Quanyan Zhu

The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced
complex challenges in the responsibility and accountability in the event of
incidents involving AI-enabled systems. The interconnectivity of these systems,
ethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI
technology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional
responsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a
Computational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and
ethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders.
The computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the
limitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted
scenarios, showcasing the framework's explainability, coherence, and adaptivity
properties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal
role of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium
computation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case
study, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse
responsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into
accountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a
sustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and
reflection.

##### **Taming False Positives in Out-of-Distribution Detection with Human Feedback**
2404.16954v1 by Harit Vishwakarma,Heguang Lin,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak

Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safely
deploying machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused
on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate
thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD
samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to
achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\%$ TPR. However, this can
lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\%, as
observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications,
e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with
various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a
mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback
to \emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical
results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times
while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our
framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty
quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark
OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5\%$ while
maximizing TPR.

##### **Uncovering Deceptive Tendencies in Language Models: A Simulated Company AI Assistant**
2405.01576v1 by Olli Järviniemi,Evan Hubinger

We study the tendency of AI systems to deceive by constructing a realistic
simulation setting of a company AI assistant. The simulated company employees
provide tasks for the assistant to complete, these tasks spanning writing
assistance, information retrieval and programming. We then introduce situations
where the model might be inclined to behave deceptively, while taking care to
not instruct or otherwise pressure the model to do so. Across different
scenarios, we find that Claude 3 Opus
  1) complies with a task of mass-generating comments to influence public
perception of the company, later deceiving humans about it having done so,
  2) lies to auditors when asked questions, and
  3) strategically pretends to be less capable than it is during capability
evaluations.
  Our work demonstrates that even models trained to be helpful, harmless and
honest sometimes behave deceptively in realistic scenarios, without notable
external pressure to do so.

##### **Features Fusion for Dual-View Mammography Mass Detection**
2404.16718v1 by Arina Varlamova,Valery Belotsky,Grigory Novikov,Anton Konushin,Evgeny Sidorov

Detection of malignant lesions on mammography images is extremely important
for early breast cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, images are acquired
from two different angles, and radiologists can fully utilize information from
both views, simultaneously locating the same lesion. However, for automatic
detection approaches such information fusion remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose a new model called MAMM-Net, which allows the processing of
both mammography views simultaneously by sharing information not only on an
object level, as seen in existing works, but also on a feature level.
MAMM-Net's key component is the Fusion Layer, based on deformable attention and
designed to increase detection precision while keeping high recall. Our
experiments show superior performance on the public DDSM dataset compared to
the previous state-of-the-art model, while introducing new helpful features
such as lesion annotation on pixel-level and classification of lesions
malignancy.

##### **Large Language Models in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Benchmark**
2405.00716v1 by Andrew Liu,Hongjian Zhou,Yining Hua,Omid Rohanian,Lei Clifton,David A. Clifton

The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has
attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended
question-answering task with answer options for evaluation. However, in real
clinical settings, many clinical decisions, such as treatment recommendations,
involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. Meanwhile,
existing studies mainly use accuracy to assess model performance. In this
paper, we comprehensively benchmark diverse LLMs in healthcare, to clearly
understand their strengths and weaknesses. Our benchmark contains seven tasks
and thirteen datasets across medical language generation, understanding, and
reasoning. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the existing sixteen LLMs in
healthcare under both zero-shot and few-shot (i.e., 1,3,5-shot) learning
settings. We report the results on five metrics (i.e. matching, faithfulness,
comprehensiveness, generalizability, and robustness) that are critical in
achieving trust from clinical users. We further invite medical experts to
conduct human evaluation.

The widespread adoption of social media platforms globally not only enhances
users' connectivity and communication but also emerges as a vital channel for
the dissemination of health-related information, thereby establishing social
media data as an invaluable organic data resource for public health research.
The surge in popularity of vaping or e-cigarette use in the United States and
other countries has caused an outbreak of e-cigarette and vaping use-associated
lung injury (EVALI), leading to hospitalizations and fatalities in 2019,
highlighting the urgency to comprehend vaping behaviors and develop effective
strategies for cession. In this study, we extracted a sample dataset from one
vaping sub-community on Reddit to analyze users' quit vaping intentions.
Leveraging large language models including both the latest GPT-4 and
traditional BERT-based language models for sentence-level quit-vaping intention
prediction tasks, this study compares the outcomes of these models against
human annotations. Notably, when compared to human evaluators, GPT-4 model
demonstrates superior consistency in adhering to annotation guidelines and
processes, showcasing advanced capabilities to detect nuanced user quit-vaping
intentions that human evaluators might overlook. These preliminary findings
emphasize the potential of GPT-4 in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
social media data analysis, especially in identifying subtle users' intentions
that may elude human detection.

##### **Towards Adapting Open-Source Large Language Models for Expert-Level Clinical Note Generation**
2405.00715v1 by Hanyin Wang,Chufan Gao,Bolun Liu,Qiping Xu,Guleid Hussein,Mohamad El Labban,Kingsley Iheasirim,Hariprasad Korsapati,Jimeng Sun

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in handling
clinical text summarization tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that a small
open-source LLM can be effectively trained to generate high-quality clinical
notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. We achieve this through a
comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the LLaMA-2 13
billion parameter model. This process incorporates continued pre-training,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human
feedback. We introduced an enhanced approach, termed DistillDirect, for
performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini Pro serving as the
teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, is capable of generating
clinical notes that are comparable in quality to those authored by physicians.
In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual
evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher
across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy.
Notably, in the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic
scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness compared to physician-authored
notes (4.1/5). Additionally, we identified caveats in public clinical note
datasets, such as ACI-BENCH. We highlight key considerations for future
clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a
best-practice note format. Overall, our research demonstrates the potential and
feasibility of training smaller, open-source LLMs to assist with clinical
documentation, capitalizing on healthcare institutions' access to patient
records and domain expertise. We have made our newly created synthetic clinic
dialogue-note dataset and the physician feedback dataset publicly available to
foster future research in this field.

##### **ProbGate at EHRSQL 2024: Enhancing SQL Query Generation Accuracy through Probabilistic Threshold Filtering and Error Handling**
2404.16659v1 by Sangryul Kim,Donghee Han,Sehyun Kim

Recently, deep learning-based language models have significantly enhanced
text-to-SQL tasks, with promising applications in retrieving patient records
within the medical domain. One notable challenge in such applications is
discerning unanswerable queries. Through fine-tuning model, we demonstrate the
feasibility of converting medical record inquiries into SQL queries.
Additionally, we introduce an entropy-based method to identify and filter out
unanswerable results. We further enhance result quality by filtering
low-confidence SQL through log probability-based distribution, while
grammatical and schema errors are mitigated by executing queries on the actual
database. We experimentally verified that our method can filter unanswerable
questions, which can be widely utilized even when the parameters of the model
are not accessible, and that it can be effectively utilized in practice.

2404.16621v1 by Emre Can Acikgoz,Osman Batur İnce,Rayene Bench,Arda Anıl Boz,İlker Kesen,Aykut Erdem,Erkut Erdem

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises to
transform medical diagnostics, research, and patient care. Yet, the progression
of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous
evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict
academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is
essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging
innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM
framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to
previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets,
codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed
to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon,
refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem.
Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical
domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training,
instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our
models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even
surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock
the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient
care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making
them available across the globe.

##### **DiffSeg: A Segmentation Model for Skin Lesions Based on Diffusion Difference**
2404.16474v1 by Zhihao Shuai,Yinan Chen,Shunqiang Mao,Yihan Zho,Xiaohong Zhang

Weakly supervised medical image segmentation (MIS) using generative models is
crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, the accuracy of the segmentation
results is often limited by insufficient supervision and the complex nature of
medical imaging. Existing models also only provide a single outcome, which does
not allow for the measurement of uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce
DiffSeg, a segmentation model for skin lesions based on diffusion difference
which exploits diffusion model principles to ex-tract noise-based features from
images with diverse semantic information. By discerning difference between
these noise features, the model identifies diseased areas. Moreover, its
multi-output capability mimics doctors' annotation behavior, facilitating the
visualization of segmentation result consistency and ambiguity. Additionally,
it quantifies output uncertainty using Generalized Energy Distance (GED),
aiding interpretability and decision-making for physicians. Finally, the model
integrates outputs through the Dense Conditional Random Field (DenseCRF)
algorithm to refine the segmentation boundaries by considering inter-pixel
correlations, which improves the accuracy and optimizes the segmentation
results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffSeg on the ISIC 2018 Challenge
dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods.

##### **Light-weight Retinal Layer Segmentation with Global Reasoning**
2404.16346v1 by Xiang He,Weiye Song,Yiming Wang,Fabio Poiesi,Ji Yi,Manishi Desai,Quanqing Xu,Kongzheng Yang,Yi Wan

Automatic retinal layer segmentation with medical images, such as optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images, serves as an important tool for diagnosing
ophthalmic diseases. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate
segmentation due to low contrast and blood flow noises presented in the images.
In addition, the algorithm should be light-weight to be deployed for practical
clinical applications. Therefore, it is desired to design a light-weight
network with high performance for retinal layer segmentation. In this paper, we
propose LightReSeg for retinal layer segmentation which can be applied to OCT
images. Specifically, our approach follows an encoder-decoder structure, where
the encoder part employs multi-scale feature extraction and a Transformer block
for fully exploiting the semantic information of feature maps at all scales and
making the features have better global reasoning capabilities, while the
decoder part, we design a multi-scale asymmetric attention (MAA) module for
preserving the semantic information at each encoder scale. The experiments show
that our approach achieves a better segmentation performance compared to the
current state-of-the-art method TransUnet with 105.7M parameters on both our
collected dataset and two other public datasets, with only 3.3M parameters.

##### **Semantic Segmentation Refiner for Ultrasound Applications with Zero-Shot Foundation Models**
2404.16325v1 by Hedda Cohen Indelman,Elay Dahan,Angeles M. Perez-Agosto,Carmit Shiran,Doron Shaked,Nati Daniel

Despite the remarkable success of deep learning in medical imaging analysis,
medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality labeled images for supervision. Further, the significant domain
gap between natural and medical images in general and ultrasound images in
particular hinders fine-tuning models trained on natural images to the task at
hand. In this work, we address the performance degradation of segmentation
models in low-data regimes and propose a prompt-less segmentation method
harnessing the ability of segmentation foundation models to segment abstract
shapes. We do that via our novel prompt point generation algorithm which uses
coarse semantic segmentation masks as input and a zero-shot prompt-able
foundation model as an optimization target. We demonstrate our method on a
segmentation findings task (pathologic anomalies) in ultrasound images. Our
method's advantages are brought to light in varying degrees of low-data regime
experiments on a small-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound images dataset,
yielding a larger performance gain as the training set size decreases.

##### **LLM-Based Section Identifiers Excel on Open Source but Stumble in Real World Applications**
2404.16294v1 by Saranya Krishnamoorthy,Ayush Singh,Shabnam Tafreshi

Electronic health records (EHR) even though a boon for healthcare
practitioners, are growing convoluted and longer every day. Sifting around
these lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient
interaction. Several approaches have been proposed to help alleviate this
prevalent issue either via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few
approaches have truly been helpful in the past. With the rise of automated
methods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of
identifying relevant sections in EHR. However, most ML methods rely on labeled
data which is difficult to get in healthcare. Large language models (LLMs) on
the other hand, have performed impressive feats in natural language processing
(NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. To that
end, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that
GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well
as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we
also annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to
perform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.

##### **Investigating the prompt leakage effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions**
2404.16251v2 by Divyansh Agarwal,Alexander R. Fabbri,Philippe Laban,Ben Risher,Shafiq Joty,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu

Prompt leakage in large language models (LLMs) poses a significant security
and privacy threat, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems. However, leakage in multi-turn LLM interactions along with mitigation
strategies has not been studied in a standardized manner. This paper
investigates LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage across 4 diverse
domains and 10 closed- and open-source LLMs. Our unique multi-turn threat model
leverages the LLM's sycophancy effect and our analysis dissects task
instruction and knowledge leakage in the LLM response. In a multi-turn setting,
our threat model elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) to 86.2%,
including a 99% leakage with GPT-4 and claude-1.3. We find that some black-box
LLMs like Gemini show variable susceptibility to leakage across domains - they
are more likely to leak contextual knowledge in the news domain compared to the
medical domain. Our experiments measure specific effects of 6 black-box defense
strategies, including a query-rewriter in the RAG scenario. Our proposed
multi-tier combination of defenses still has an ASR of 5.3% for black-box LLMs,
indicating room for enhancement and future direction for LLM security research.

##### **ABCD: Trust enhanced Attention based Convolutional Autoencoder for Risk Assessment**
2404.16183v1 by Sarala Naidu,Ning Xiong

Anomaly detection in industrial systems is crucial for preventing equipment
failures, ensuring risk identification, and maintaining overall system
efficiency. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on fixed thresholds and
empirical rules, which may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in
system health and predict impending failures. To address this limitation, this
paper proposes, a novel Attention-based convolutional autoencoder (ABCD) for
risk detection and map the risk value derive to the maintenance planning. ABCD
learns the normal behavior of conductivity from historical data of a real-world
industrial cooling system and reconstructs the input data, identifying
anomalies that deviate from the expected patterns. The framework also employs
calibration techniques to ensure the reliability of its predictions. Evaluation
results demonstrate that with the attention mechanism in ABCD a 57.4% increase
in performance and a reduction of false alarms by 9.37% is seen compared to
without attention. The approach can effectively detect risks, the risk priority
rank mapped to maintenance, providing valuable insights for cooling system
designers and service personnel. Calibration error of 0.03% indicates that the
model is well-calibrated and enhances model's trustworthiness, enabling
informed decisions about maintenance strategies

##### **Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges**
2404.16112v1 by Badri Narayana Patro,Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran

Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural
Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music
generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short
Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling
tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However,
the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given
their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention
complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have
been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or
convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still
have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have
emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this
context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd,
Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear
Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the
foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures,
Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also
highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video,
audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including
genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series
analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of
SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast,
COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets. The project page for Mamba-360

##### **Mammo-CLIP: Leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for Enhanced Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Multi-view Mammography**
2404.15946v1 by Xuxin Chen,Yuheng Li,Mingzhe Hu,Ella Salari,Xiaoqian Chen,Richard L. J. Qiu,Bin Zheng,Xiaofeng Yang

Although fusion of information from multiple views of mammograms plays an
important role to increase accuracy of breast cancer detection, developing
multi-view mammograms-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes still faces
challenges and no such CAD schemes have been used in clinical practice. To
overcome the challenges, we investigate a new approach based on Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which has sparked interest across various
medical imaging tasks. By solving the challenges in (1) effectively adapting
the single-view CLIP for multi-view feature fusion and (2) efficiently
fine-tuning this parameter-dense model with limited samples and computational
resources, we introduce Mammo-CLIP, the first multi-modal framework to process
multi-view mammograms and corresponding simple texts. Mammo-CLIP uses an early
feature fusion strategy to learn multi-view relationships in four mammograms
acquired from the CC and MLO views of the left and right breasts. To enhance
learning efficiency, plug-and-play adapters are added into CLIP image and text
encoders for fine-tuning parameters and limiting updates to about 1% of the
parameters. For framework evaluation, we assembled two datasets
retrospectively. The first dataset, comprising 470 malignant and 479 benign
cases, was used for few-shot fine-tuning and internal evaluation of the
proposed Mammo-CLIP via 5-fold cross-validation. The second dataset, including
60 malignant and 294 benign cases, was used to test generalizability of
Mammo-CLIP. Study results show that Mammo-CLIP outperforms the state-of-art
cross-view transformer in AUC (0.841 vs. 0.817, 0.837 vs. 0.807) on both
datasets. It also surpasses previous two CLIP-based methods by 20.3% and 14.3%.
This study highlights the potential of applying the finetuned vision-language
models for developing next-generation, image-text-based CAD schemes of breast
cancer.

##### **Assessing The Potential Of Mid-Sized Language Models For Clinical QA**
2404.15894v1 by Elliot Bolton,Betty Xiong,Vijaytha Muralidharan,Joel Schamroth,Vivek Muralidharan,Christopher D. Manning,Roxana Daneshjou

Large language models, such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM, have shown impressive
performance on clinical tasks; however, they require access to compute, are
closed-source, and cannot be deployed on device. Mid-size models such as
BioGPT-large, BioMedLM, LLaMA 2, and Mistral 7B avoid these drawbacks, but
their capacity for clinical tasks has been understudied. To help assess their
potential for clinical use and help researchers decide which model they should
use, we compare their performance on two clinical question-answering (QA)
tasks: MedQA and consumer query answering. We find that Mistral 7B is the best
performing model, winning on all benchmarks and outperforming models trained
specifically for the biomedical domain. While Mistral 7B's MedQA score of 63.0%
approaches the original Med-PaLM, and it often can produce plausible responses
to consumer health queries, room for improvement still exists. This study
provides the first head-to-head assessment of open source mid-sized models on
clinical tasks.

##### **Enhancing Diagnosis through AI-driven Analysis of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy**
2404.16080v1 by Hong-Jun Yoon,Chris Keum,Alexander Witkowski,Joanna Ludzik,Tracy Petrie,Heidi A. Hanson,Sancy A. Leachman

Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique
used in biomedical research and clinical dermatology. It provides virtual
high-resolution images of the skin and superficial tissues, reducing the need
for physical biopsies. RCM employs a laser light source to illuminate the
tissue, capturing the reflected light to generate detailed images of
microscopic structures at various depths. Recent studies explored AI and
machine learning, particularly CNNs, for analyzing RCM images. Our study
proposes a segmentation strategy based on textural features to identify
clinically significant regions, empowering dermatologists in effective image
interpretation and boosting diagnostic confidence. This approach promises to
advance dermatological diagnosis and treatment.

##### **A Hybrid Probabilistic Battery Health Management Approach for Robust Inspection Drone Operations**
2405.00055v1 by Jokin Alcibar,Jose I. Aizpurua,Ekhi Zugastia,Oier Penagarikano

Health monitoring of remote critical infrastructure is a complex and
expensive activity due to the limited infrastructure accessibility. Inspection
drones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical
infrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh
operation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure
successful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that
determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an
appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust
inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic
approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po
batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration,
which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction
models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of
the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset
comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained
from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore
wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different
probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in
probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition,
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the
diagnosis of battery health-states.

##### **Anomaly Detection for Incident Response at Scale**
2404.16887v1 by Hanzhang Wang,Gowtham Kumar Tangirala,Gilkara Pranav Naidu,Charles Mayville,Arighna Roy,Joanne Sun,Ramesh Babu Mandava

We present a machine learning-based anomaly detection product, AI Detect and
Respond (AIDR), that monitors Walmart's business and system health in
real-time. During the validation over 3 months, the product served predictions
from over 3000 models to more than 25 application, platform, and operation
teams, covering 63\% of major incidents and reducing the mean-time-to-detect
(MTTD) by more than 7 minutes. Unlike previous anomaly detection methods, our
solution leverages statistical, ML and deep learning models while continuing to
incorporate rule-based static thresholds to incorporate domain-specific
knowledge. Both univariate and multivariate ML models are deployed and
maintained through distributed services for scalability and high availability.
AIDR has a feedback loop that assesses model quality with a combination of
drift detection algorithms and customer feedback. It also offers
self-onboarding capabilities and customizability. AIDR has achieved success
with various internal teams with lower time to detection and fewer false
positives than previous methods. As we move forward, we aim to expand incident
coverage and prevention, reduce noise, and integrate further with root cause
recommendation (RCR) to enable an end-to-end AIDR experience.

##### **Adapting an Artificial Intelligence Sexually Transmitted Diseases Symptom Checker Tool for Mpox Detection: The HeHealth Experience**
2404.16885v1 by Rayner Kay Jin Tan,Dilruk Perera,Salomi Arasaratnam,Yudara Kularathne

Artificial Intelligence applications have shown promise in the management of
pandemics and have been widely used to assist the identification,
classification, and diagnosis of medical images. In response to the global
outbreak of Monkeypox (Mpox), the HeHealth.ai team leveraged an existing tool
to screen for sexually transmitted diseases to develop a digital screening test
for symptomatic Mpox through AI approaches. Prior to the global outbreak of
Mpox, the team developed a smartphone app, where app users can use their own
smartphone cameras to take pictures of their own penises to screen for
symptomatic STD. The AI model was initially developed using 5000 cases and use
a modified convolutional neural network to output prediction scores across
visually diagnosable penis pathologies including Syphilis, Herpes Simplex
Virus, and Human Papilloma Virus. From June 2022 to October 2022, a total of
about 22,000 users downloaded the HeHealth app, and about 21,000 images have
been analyzed using HeHealth AI technology. We then engaged in formative
research, stakeholder engagement, rapid consolidation images, a validation
study, and implementation of the tool from July 2022. From July 2022 to October
2022, a total of 1000 Mpox related images had been used to train the Mpox
symptom checker tool. Our digital symptom checker tool showed accuracy of 87%
to rule in Mpox and 90% to rule out symptomatic Mpox. Several hurdles
identified included issues of data privacy and security for app users, initial
lack of data to train the AI tool, and the potential generalizability of input
data. We offer several suggestions to help others get started on similar
projects in emergency situations, including engaging a wide range of
stakeholders, having a multidisciplinary team, prioritizing pragmatism, as well
as the concept that big data in fact is made up of small data.

##### **PRISM: Patient Records Interpretation for Semantic Clinical Trial Matching using Large Language Models**
2404.15549v2 by Shashi Kant Gupta,Aditya Basu,Mauro Nievas,Jerrin Thomas,Nathan Wolfrath,Adhitya Ramamurthi,Bradley Taylor,Anai N. Kothari,Regina Schwind,Therica M. Miller,Sorena Nadaf-Rahrov,Yanshan Wang,Hrituraj Singh

Clinical trial matching is the task of identifying trials for which patients
may be potentially eligible. Typically, this task is labor-intensive and
requires detailed verification of patient electronic health records (EHRs)
against the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials. This
process is manual, time-intensive, and challenging to scale up, resulting in
many patients missing out on potential therapeutic options. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made automating patient-trial matching
possible, as shown in multiple concurrent research studies. However, the
current approaches are confined to constrained, often synthetic datasets that
do not adequately mirror the complexities encountered in real-world medical
data. In this study, we present the first, end-to-end large-scale empirical
evaluation of clinical trial matching using real-world EHRs. Our study
showcases the capability of LLMs to accurately match patients with appropriate
clinical trials. We perform experiments with proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4
and GPT-3.5, as well as our custom fine-tuned model called OncoLLM and show
that OncoLLM, despite its significantly smaller size, not only outperforms
GPT-3.5 but also matches the performance of qualified medical doctors. All
experiments were carried out on real-world EHRs that include clinical notes and
available clinical trials from a single cancer center in the United States.

##### **Multi-scale Intervention Planning based on Generative Design**
2404.15492v1 by Ioannis Kavouras,Ioannis Rallis,Emmanuel Sardis,Eftychios Protopapadakis,Anastasios Doulamis,Nikolaos Doulamis

The scarcity of green spaces, in urban environments, consists a critical
challenge. There are multiple adverse effects, impacting the health and
well-being of the citizens. Small scale interventions, e.g. pocket parks, is a
viable solution, but comes with multiple constraints, involving the design and
implementation over a specific area. In this study, we harness the capabilities
of generative AI for multi-scale intervention planning, focusing on nature
based solutions. By leveraging image-to-image and image inpainting algorithms,
we propose a methodology to address the green space deficit in urban areas.
Focusing on two alleys in Thessaloniki, where greenery is lacking, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in visualizing NBS interventions. Our
findings underscore the transformative potential of emerging technologies in
shaping the future of urban intervention planning processes.

##### **IryoNLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Tackling the Medical Error Detection & Correction Task On the Shoulders of Medical Agents**
2404.15488v1 by Jean-Philippe Corbeil

In natural language processing applied to the clinical domain, utilizing
large language models has emerged as a promising avenue for error detection and
correction on clinical notes, a knowledge-intensive task for which annotated
data is scarce. This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a
suite of four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the
process by observing, analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to
guide the search to target a potential error in the clinical notes.
Subsequently, the MedEval agent employs five evaluators to assess the targeted
error and the proposed correction. In cases where MedReAct's actions prove
insufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging in reflective analysis
and proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser agent formats
the final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the integrity of
the error correction process. One core component of our method is our RAG
pipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources
containing clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the
open-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application. Our results
demonstrate the central role of our RAG approach with ClinicalCorp leveraged
through the MedReAct'N'MedReFlex framework. It achieved the ninth rank on the
MEDIQA-CORR 2024 final leaderboard.

##### **Interactive Analysis of LLMs using Meaningful Counterfactuals**
2405.00708v1 by Furui Cheng,Vilém Zouhar,Robin Shing Moon Chan,Daniel Fürst,Hendrik Strobelt,Mennatallah El-Assady

Counterfactual examples are useful for exploring the decision boundaries of
machine learning models and determining feature attributions. How can we apply
counterfactual-based methods to analyze and explain LLMs? We identify the
following key challenges. First, the generated textual counterfactuals should
be meaningful and readable to users and thus can be mentally compared to draw
conclusions. Second, to make the solution scalable to long-form text, users
should be equipped with tools to create batches of counterfactuals from
perturbations at various granularity levels and interactively analyze the
results. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and contribute 1) a
novel algorithm for generating batches of complete and meaningful textual
counterfactuals by removing and replacing text segments in different
granularities, and 2) LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization tool to help
users understand an LLM's behaviors by interactively inspecting and aggregating
meaningful counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by the
grammatical correctness of its generated counterfactuals using 1,000 samples
from medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets. In our experiments,
97.2% of the counterfactuals are grammatically correct. Through a use case,
user studies, and feedback from experts, we demonstrate the usefulness and
usability of the proposed interactive visualization tool.

##### **Machine Learning Techniques with Fairness for Prediction of Completion of Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation**
2404.15418v1 by Karen Roberts-Licklider,Theodore Trafalis

The aim of this study is to look at predicting whether a person will complete
a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program and the number of times a person
attends. The study is based on demographic data obtained from Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) from both admissions and
discharge data from drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers in Oklahoma.
Demographic data is highly categorical which led to binary encoding being used
and various fairness measures being utilized to mitigate bias of nine
demographic variables. Kernel methods such as linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and
radial basis functions were compared using support vector machines at various
parameter ranges to find the optimal values. These were then compared to
methods such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Synthetic
Minority Oversampling Technique Nominal (SMOTEN) for categorical data was used
to balance the data with imputation for missing data. The nine bias variables
were then intersectionalized to mitigate bias and the dual and triple
interactions were integrated to use the probabilities to look at worst case
ratio fairness mitigation. Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity difference,
Conditional Statistical Parity Ratio, Demographic Parity, Demographic Parity
Ratio, Equalized Odds, Equalized Odds Ratio, Equal Opportunity, and Equalized
Opportunity Ratio were all explored at both the binary and multiclass
scenarios.

##### **CT-GLIP: 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT Scans and Radiology Reports for Full-Body Scenarios**
2404.15272v3 by Jingyang Lin,Yingda Xia,Jianpeng Zhang,Ke Yan,Le Lu,Jiebo Luo,Ling Zhang

Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (Med-VLP) establishes a connection
between visual content from medical images and the relevant textual
descriptions. Existing Med-VLP methods primarily focus on 2D images depicting a
single body part, notably chest X-rays. In this paper, we extend the scope of
Med-VLP to encompass 3D images, specifically targeting full-body scenarios, by
using a multimodal dataset of CT images and reports. Compared with the 2D
counterpart, 3D VLP is required to effectively capture essential semantics from
significantly sparser representation in 3D imaging. In this paper, we introduce
CT-GLIP (Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT scans), a novel method
that constructs organ-level image-text pairs to enhance multimodal contrastive
learning, aligning grounded visual features with precise diagnostic text.
Additionally, we developed an abnormality dictionary to augment contrastive
learning with diverse contrastive pairs. Our method, trained on a multimodal CT
dataset comprising 44,011 organ-level vision-text pairs from 17,702 patients
across 104 organs, demonstrates it can identify organs and abnormalities in a
zero-shot manner using natural languages. The performance of CT-GLIP is
validated on a separate test set of 1,130 patients, focusing on the 16 most
frequent abnormalities across 7 organs. The experimental results show our
model's superior performance over the standard CLIP framework across zero-shot
and fine-tuning scenarios, using both CNN and ViT architectures.

##### **A review of deep learning-based information fusion techniques for multimodal medical image classification**
2404.15022v1 by Yihao Li,Mostafa El Habib Daho,Pierre-Henri Conze,Rachid Zeghlache,Hugo Le Boité,Ramin Tadayoni,Béatrice Cochener,Mathieu Lamard,Gwenolé Quellec

Multimodal medical imaging plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis and
research, as it combines information from various imaging modalities to provide
a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathology. Recently, deep
learning-based multimodal fusion techniques have emerged as powerful tools for
improving medical image classification. This review offers a thorough analysis
of the developments in deep learning-based multimodal fusion for medical
classification tasks. We explore the complementary relationships among
prevalent clinical modalities and outline three main fusion schemes for
multimodal classification networks: input fusion, intermediate fusion
(encompassing single-level fusion, hierarchical fusion, and attention-based
fusion), and output fusion. By evaluating the performance of these fusion
techniques, we provide insight into the suitability of different network
architectures for various multimodal fusion scenarios and application domains.
Furthermore, we delve into challenges related to network architecture
selection, handling incomplete multimodal data management, and the potential
limitations of multimodal fusion. Finally, we spotlight the promising future of
Transformer-based multimodal fusion techniques and give recommendations for
future research in this rapidly evolving field.

##### **Clustering of timed sequences -- Application to the analysis of care pathways**
2404.15379v1 by Thomas Guyet,Pierre Pinson,Enoal Gesny

Improving the future of healthcare starts by better understanding the current
actual practices in hospitals. This motivates the objective of discovering
typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing homogeneous groups of care
pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care
pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a
semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms.
  In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to time
sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of
averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering
algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed
sequences.
  This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real use
cases.

##### **Grounded Knowledge-Enhanced Medical VLP for Chest X-Ray**
2404.14750v1 by Qiao Deng,Zhongzhen Huang,Yunqi Wang,Zhichuan Wang,Zhao Wang,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou,Yeung Yu Hui,Edward S. Hui

Medical vision-language pre-training has emerged as a promising approach for
learning domain-general representations of medical image and text. Current
algorithms that exploit the global and local alignment between medical image
and text could however be marred by the redundant information in medical data.
To address this issue, we propose a grounded knowledge-enhanced medical
vision-language pre-training (GK-MVLP) framework for chest X-ray. In this
framework, medical knowledge is grounded to the appropriate anatomical regions
by using a transformer-based grounded knowledge-enhanced module for
fine-grained alignment between anatomical region-level visual features and the
textural features of medical knowledge. The performance of GK-MVLP is
competitive with or exceeds the state of the art on downstream chest X-ray
disease classification, disease localization, report generation, and medical
visual question-answering tasks. Our results show the advantage of
incorporating grounding mechanism to remove biases and improve the alignment
between chest X-ray image and radiology report.

##### **DAIC-WOZ: On the Validity of Using the Therapist's prompts in Automatic Depression Detection from Clinical Interviews**
2404.14463v1 by Sergio Burdisso,Ernesto Reyes-Ramírez,Esaú Villatoro-Tello,Fernando Sánchez-Vega,Pastor López-Monroy,Petr Motlicek

Automatic depression detection from conversational data has gained
significant interest in recent years. The DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews
conducted by a human-controlled virtual agent, has been widely used for this
task. Recent studies have reported enhanced performance when incorporating
interviewer's prompts into the model. In this work, we hypothesize that this
improvement might be mainly due to a bias present in these prompts, rather than
the proposed architectures and methods. Through ablation experiments and
qualitative analysis, we discover that models using interviewer's prompts learn
to focus on a specific region of the interviews, where questions about past
experiences with mental health issues are asked, and use them as discriminative
shortcuts to detect depressed participants. In contrast, models using
participant responses gather evidence from across the entire interview.
Finally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve a 0.90 F1 score by
intentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported to date on this
dataset using only textual information. Our findings underline the need for
caution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as they may
inadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning to
characterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the
patient's mental health condition.

##### **Adaptive Collaboration Strategy for LLMs in Medical Decision Making**
2404.15155v1 by Yubin Kim,Chanwoo Park,Hyewon Jeong,Yik Siu Chan,Xuhai Xu,Daniel McDuff,Cynthia Breazeal,Hae Won Park

Foundation models have become invaluable in advancing the medical field.
Despite their promise, the strategic deployment of LLMs for effective utility
in complex medical tasks remains an open question. Our novel framework, Medical
Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) aims to address this gap by automatically
assigning the effective collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or
group collaboration structure is tailored to the complexity of the medical task
at hand, emulating real-world medical decision making processes. We evaluate
our framework and baseline methods with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of
challenging medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA,
Path-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best performance in 5 out of 7 benchmarks
that require an understanding of multi-modal medical reasoning. Ablation
studies reveal that MDAgents excels in adapting the number of collaborating
agents to optimize efficiency and accuracy, showcasing its robustness in
diverse scenarios. We also explore the dynamics of group consensus, offering
insights into how collaborative agents could behave in complex clinical team
dynamics. Our code can be found at https://github.com/mitmedialab/MDAgents.

##### **A Nasal Cytology Dataset for Object Detection and Deep Learning**
2404.13745v1 by Mauro Camporeale,Giovanni Dimauro,Matteo Gelardi,Giorgia Iacobellis,Mattia Sebastiano Ladisa,Sergio Latrofa,Nunzia Lomonte

Nasal Cytology is a new and efficient clinical technique to diagnose rhinitis
and allergies that is not much widespread due to the time-consuming nature of
cell counting; that is why AI-aided counting could be a turning point for the
diffusion of this technique. In this article we present the first dataset of
rhino-cytological field images: the NCD (Nasal Cytology Dataset), aimed to
train and deploy Object Detection models to support physicians and biologists
during clinical practice. The real distribution of the cytotypes, populating
the nasal mucosa has been replicated, sampling images from slides of clinical
patients, and manually annotating each cell found on them. The correspondent
object detection task presents non'trivial issues associated with the strong
class imbalancement, involving the rarest cell types. This work contributes to
some of open challenges by presenting a novel machine learning-based approach
to aid the automated detection and classification of nasal mucosa cells: the
DETR and YOLO models shown good performance in detecting cells and classifying
them correctly, revealing great potential to accelerate the work of rhinology
experts.

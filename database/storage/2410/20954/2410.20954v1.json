Among them, the solution\nparadigm of modeling other agents attracts our interest, which is different\nfrom traditional value decomposition or communication mechanisms. It enables\nagents to understand and anticipate others' behaviors and facilitates their\ncollaboration. Inspired by recent research on the legibility that allows agents\nto reveal their intentions through their behavior, we propose a multiagent\nactive legibility framework to improve their performance. The\nlegibility-oriented framework allows agents to conduct legible actions so as to\nhelp others optimise their behaviors. In addition, we design a series of\nproblem domains that emulate a common scenario and best characterize the\nlegibility in multiagent reinforcement learning. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the new framework is more efficient and costs less training\ntime compared to several multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u6c7d\u8eca\u3001\u8ecd\u4e8b\u884c\u52d5\u7b49\uff0c\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u5e8f\u5217\u6c7a\u7b56\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5176\u5ee3\u70ba\u4eba\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5373\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u9577\u8db3\u7684\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u64ec\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u9019\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u6e9d\u901a\u6a5f\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u80fd\u5920\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u7684\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4e26\u4fc3\u9032\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u95dc\u65bc\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u5141\u8a31\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u901a\u904e\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u610f\u5716\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u4e3b\u52d5\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4f86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ee5\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u70ba\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8a31\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u57f7\u884c\u53ef\u8b80\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eba\u512a\u5316\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u554f\u984c\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u6a21\u64ec\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u5834\u666f\uff0c\u4e26\u6700\u597d\u5730\u8868\u5fb5\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u5e7e\u7a2e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u66f4\u77ed\u3002", "author": "Yanyu Liu et.al.", "authors": "Yanyu Liu, Yinghui Pan, Yifeng Zeng, Biyang Ma, Doshi Prashant", "id": "2410.20954v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20954v1", "repo": "null"}}

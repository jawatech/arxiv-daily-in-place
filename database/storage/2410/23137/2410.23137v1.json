The market valuation can be\nviewed as a separate additive valuation that holds identically across all the\nagents. We seek allocations that are simultaneously fair with respect to the\nsubjective valuations and with respect to the market valuation.\n  We show that an allocation that satisfies stochastically-dominant\nenvy-freeness up to one good (SD-EF1) with respect to both the subjective\nvaluations and the market valuation does not always exist, but the weaker\nguarantee of EF1 with respect to the subjective valuations along with SD-EF1\nwith respect to the market valuation can be guaranteed. We also study a number\nof other guarantees such as Pareto optimality, EFX, and MMS. In addition, we\nexplore non-additive valuations and extend our model to cake-cutting. Along the\nway, we identify several tantalizing open questions.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u5177\u6709\u5e02\u5834\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5546\u54c1\u5fc5\u9808\u5206\u914d\u7d66\u5177\u6709\uff08\u52a0\u6cd5\uff09\u4e3b\u89c0\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u4ef6\u5546\u54c1\u984d\u5916\u5177\u6709\u5e02\u5834\u50f9\u503c\u3002\u5e02\u5834\u4f30\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u7368\u7acb\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4e4b\u9593\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0b\u6c42\u5728\u4e3b\u89c0\u4f30\u503c\u548c\u5e02\u5834\u4f30\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6eff\u8db3\u95dc\u65bc\u4e00\u500b\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u96a8\u6a5f\u652f\u914d\u5ac9\u5992\u81ea\u7531\uff08SD-EF1\uff09\uff0c\u95dc\u65bc\u4e3b\u89c0\u4f30\u503c\u548c\u5e02\u5834\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e0d\u7e3d\u662f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u95dc\u65bc\u4e3b\u89c0\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u8f03\u5f31\u4fdd\u8b49 EF1 \u4ee5\u53ca\u95dc\u65bc\u5e02\u5834\u4f30\u503c\u7684 SD-EF1 \u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u4fdd\u8b49\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u4fdd\u8b49\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u512a\u6027\u3001EFX \u548c MMS\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u52a0\u6cd5\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u86cb\u7cd5\u5207\u5272\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u5e7e\u500b\u8a98\u4eba\u7684\u958b\u653e\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Siddharth Barman et.al.", "authors": "Siddharth Barman, Soroush Ebadian, Mohamad Latifian, Nisarg Shah", "id": "2410.23137v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23137v1", "repo": "null"}}

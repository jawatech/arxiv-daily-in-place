At present, all current models are less\naccurate than the best supervised disambiguators in cases where a training set\nis available, but most models outperform graph-based unsupervised systems.\nDifferent prompting approaches are compared, with a focus on how to express the\nset of possible senses in a given context. The best accuracies are achieved\nwhen human-written definitions of the senses are included in the prompts.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u91dd\u5c0d\u5169\u500b\u745e\u5178\u8a9e\u8a5e\u5f59\u610f\u7fa9\u6d88\u6b67\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u8a55\u4f30\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u90fd\u4f4e\u65bc\u6700\u4f73\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u6d88\u6b67\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6578\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u90fd\u512a\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc\u5716\u5f62\u7684\u975e\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8108\u7d61\u4e2d\u8868\u9054\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u7576\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u985e\u64b0\u5beb\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u5b9a\u7fa9\u6642\uff0c\u53ef\u9054\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Richard Johansson et.al.", "authors": "Richard Johansson", "id": "2410.22827v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22827v1", "repo": "null"}}

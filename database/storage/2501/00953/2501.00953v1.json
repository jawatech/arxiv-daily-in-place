However, as\npowerful as current models have become, they still operate on sentence or\nmulti-sentence level input, not on the word-by-word input that humans operate\non, affecting the degree of responsiveness that they offer, which is critical\nin situations where humans interact with robots using speech. In this paper, we\nreview the literature on interactive systems that operate incrementally (i.e.,\nat the word level or below it). We motivate the need for incremental systems,\nsurvey incremental modeling of important aspects of dialogue like speech\nrecognition and language generation. Primary focus is on the part of the system\nthat makes decisions, known as the dialogue manager. We find that there is very\nlittle research on incremental dialogue management, offer some requirements for\npractical incremental dialogue management, and the implications of incremental\ndialogue for embodied, robotic platforms.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u8ce6\u4e88\u8aaa\u8a71\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u53d7\u76ca\u65bc\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u7576\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7d93\u8b8a\u5f97\u5f37\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u6216\u591a\u53e5\u5b50\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u4e0a\u904b\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eba\u985e\u904b\u4f5c\u7684\u9010\u5b57\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u9019\u5f71\u97ff\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u97ff\u61c9\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u4f7f\u7528\u8a9e\u97f3\u8207\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u4ee5\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u904b\u4f5c\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u5373\u5728\u5b57\u8a5e\u5c64\u7d1a\u6216\u5176\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09\u7684\u6587\u737b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6fc0\u52f5\u4e86\u5c0d\u589e\u91cf\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8abf\u67e5\u4e86\u5c0d\u8a71\u91cd\u8981\u9762\u5411\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58\u548c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7522\u751f\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u5c0d\u8a71\u7ba1\u7406\u54e1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u5c0d\u589e\u91cf\u5c0d\u8a71\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e38\u5c11\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5be6\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5c0d\u8a71\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u91cf\u5c0d\u8a71\u5c0d\u5177\u9ad4\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Casey Kennington et.al.", "authors": "Casey Kennington, Pierre Lison, David Schlangen", "id": "2501.00953v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00953v1", "repo": "null"}}

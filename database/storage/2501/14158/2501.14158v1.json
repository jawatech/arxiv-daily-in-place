{"2501.14158": {"publish_time": "2025-01-24", "title": "Advancing MRI Reconstruction: A Systematic Review of Deep Learning and Compressed Sensing Integration", "paper_summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality and\nprovides comprehensive anatomical and functional insights into the human body.\nHowever, its long acquisition times can lead to patient discomfort, motion\nartifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges,\nstrategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple\nreceiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally,\ncompressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from\nsparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the\namount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a\npowerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with\nparallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI\nreconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for\nMRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods,\nincluding end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning,\nhighlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights\nsignificant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI\nreconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based\nMRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration\nfactors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time.\nFinally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based\nMRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging. To facilitate further research\nin this area, we provide a GitHub repository that includes up-to-date DL-based\nMRI reconstruction publications and public\ndatasets-https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf (MRI) \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u9ad4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u6f2b\u9577\u7684\u64f7\u53d6\u6642\u9593\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u60a3\u8005\u4e0d\u9069\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u507d\u5f71\uff0c\u4e26\u9650\u5236\u5be6\u6642\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5df2\u61c9\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u500b\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7dda\u5708\u4f86\u52a0\u901f\u8cc7\u6599\u64f7\u53d6\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u58d3\u7e2e\u611f\u6e2c (CS) \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u4fc3\u9032\u5f9e\u7a00\u758f\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5c07\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u6536\u96c6\u91cf\u6e1b\u81f3\u6700\u5c11\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u7e2e\u77ed\u5f71\u50cf\u64f7\u53d6\u6642\u9593\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2 (DL) \u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u6539\u9032 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u5df2\u8207\u5e73\u884c\u5f71\u50cf\u548c CS \u539f\u7406\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u672c\u7bc7\u8a55\u8ad6\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc DL \u7684 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5404\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc DL \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u548c\u8a0e\u8ad6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5c55\u958b\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u548c\u806f\u5408\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u5176\u6f5b\u5728\u512a\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u8a55\u8ad6\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86 DL \u5728 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc DL \u7684 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u7d50\u679c\u548c\u8da8\u52e2\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6a19\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca DL \u6280\u8853\u96a8\u6642\u9593\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u65bc DL \u7684 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u63a8\u9032\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u4fc3\u9032\u9019\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b GitHub \u5132\u5b58\u5eab\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u65bc DL \u7684 MRI \u91cd\u5efa\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u548c\u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 - https://github.com/mosaf/Awesome-DL-based-CS-MRI\u3002", "author": "Mojtaba Safari et.al.", "authors": "Mojtaba Safari, Zach Eidex, Chih-Wei Chang, Richard L.

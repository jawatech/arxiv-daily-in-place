Syllable-level Textual Adversarial Attack on Tibetan Script", "paper_summary": "The textual adversarial attack refers to an attack method in which the\nattacker adds imperceptible perturbations to the original texts by elaborate\ndesign so that the NLP (natural language processing) model produces false\njudgments. This method is also used to evaluate the robustness of NLP models.\nCurrently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is\nalso a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages.\nTextual adversarial attacks are a new challenge for the information processing\nof Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a\nTibetan syllable-level black-box textual adversarial attack called TSAttacker\nbased on syllable cosine distance and scoring mechanism. And then, we conduct\nTSAttacker on six models generated by fine-tuning two PLMs (pre-trained\nlanguage models) for three downstream tasks. The experiment results show that\nTSAttacker is effective and generates high-quality adversarial samples. In\naddition, the robustness of the involved models still has much room for\nimprovement.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u662f\u6307\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u901a\u904e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8a2d\u8a08\u5411\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u96e3\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89ba\u7684\u64fe\u52d5\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u4f7f NLP\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u932f\u8aa4\u5224\u65b7\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30 NLP \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9b6f\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u82f1\u8a9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9084\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u95dc\u65bc\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u5c11\u6578\u6c11\u65cf\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u6587\u672c\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u5c11\u6578\u6c11\u65cf\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8655\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u91dd\u5c0d\u9019\u4e00\u60c5\u6cc1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u97f3\u7bc0\u9918\u5f26\u8ddd\u96e2\u548c\u8a55\u5206\u6a5f\u5236\u7684\u85cf\u8a9e\u97f3\u7bc0\u7d1a\u5225\u9ed1\u76d2\u6587\u672c\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba TSAttacker\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u901a\u904e\u5fae\u8abf\u5169\u500b PLM\uff08\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u70ba\u4e09\u500b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52d9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u516d\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86 TSAttacker\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTSAttacker \u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8cea\u91cf\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6a23\u672c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9b6f\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6539\u9032\u7a7a\u9593\u3002", "author": "Xi Cao et.al.", "authors": "Xi Cao, Dolma Dawa, Nuo Qun, Trashi Nyima", "id": "2412.02323v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02323v1", "repo": "null"}}

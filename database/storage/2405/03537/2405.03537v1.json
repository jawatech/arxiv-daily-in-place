Traditional approaches of accumulating data and\nperiodically retraining models are outpaced. We propose a novel paradigm\ncombining federated learning and continual learning, enabling distributed nodes\nto continually update models on streams of new phishing data, without\naccumulating data. These locally adapted models are then aggregated at a\ncentral server via federated learning. To enhance detection, we introduce a\ncustom attention-based classifier model with residual connections, tailored for\nweb phishing, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture intricate phishing\npatterns. We evaluate our hybrid learning paradigm across continual learning\nstrategies (cumulative, replay, MIR, LwF) and model architectures through an\nempirical investigation. Our main contributions are: (1) a new hybrid\nfederated-continual learning paradigm for robust web phishing detection, and\n(2) a novel attention + residual connections based model explicitly designed\nfor this task, attaining 0.93 accuracy, 0.90 precision, 0.96 recall and 0.93\nf1-score with the LwF strategy, outperforming traditional approaches in\ndetecting emerging phishing threats while retaining past knowledge.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jesher Joshua M et.al.", "authors": "Jesher Joshua M,Adhithya R,Sree Dananjay S,M Revathi", "id": "2405.03537v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03537v1", "repo": "null"}}

Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are associated with textual\nfeatures, are crucial due to their prevalence in real-world applications and\nare commonly used to evaluate these vulnerabilities. However, existing research\nonly focuses on embedding-level GIAs, which inject node embeddings rather than\nactual textual content, limiting their applicability and simplifying detection.\nIn this paper, we pioneer the exploration of GIAs at the text level, presenting\nthree novel attack designs that inject textual content into the graph. Through\ntheoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that text interpretability,\na factor previously overlooked at the embedding level, plays a crucial role in\nattack strength. Among the designs we investigate, the Word-frequency-based\nText-level GIA (WTGIA) is particularly notable for its balance between\nperformance and interpretability. Despite the success of WTGIA, we discover\nthat defenders can easily enhance their defenses with customized text embedding\nmethods or large language model (LLM)--based predictors. These insights\nunderscore the necessity for further research into the potential and practical\nsignificance of text-level GIAs.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5716\u5f62\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5716\u5f62\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u64ca (GIA)\uff0c\u5b83\u6703\u5c07\u60e1\u610f\u7bc0\u9ede\u6ce8\u5165\u539f\u59cb\u5716\u5f62\u4e26\u69cb\u6210\u73fe\u5be6\u5a01\u8105\u3002\u6587\u5b57\u5c6c\u6027\u5716\u5f62 (TAG) \u7531\u65bc\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u5f88\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u9019\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u50c5\u95dc\u6ce8\u5d4c\u5165\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684 GIA\uff0c\u5b83\u6ce8\u5165\u7bc0\u9ede\u5d4c\u5165\u800c\u975e\u5be6\u969b\u6587\u672c\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u9069\u7528\u6027\u4e26\u7c21\u5316\u4e86\u6aa2\u6e2c\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7387\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684 GIA\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7a2e\u5c07\u6587\u672c\u5167\u5bb9\u6ce8\u5165\u5716\u5f62\u7684\u5275\u65b0\u653b\u64ca\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u900f\u904e\u7406\u8ad6\u548c\u5be6\u8b49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\uff08\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c64\u7d1a\u4ee5\u524d\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff09\u5728\u653b\u64ca\u5f37\u5ea6\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4e86\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u8a5e\u983b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5c64\u7d1a GIA (WTGIA) \u7279\u5225\u4ee5\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u8457\u7a31\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 WTGIA \u6210\u529f\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u9632\u79a6\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u81ea\u8a02\u6587\u5b57\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u5668\u8f15\u9b06\u52a0\u5f37\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u9632\u79a6\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u898b\u89e3\u5f37\u8abf\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5c64\u7d1a GIA \u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "author": "Runlin Lei et.al.", "authors": "Runlin Lei, Yuwei Hu, Yuchen Ren, Zhewei Wei", "id": "2405.16405v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16405v1", "repo": "null"}}

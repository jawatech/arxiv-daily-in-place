{"2412.08457": {"publish_time": "2024-12-11", "title": "Efficient Rectification of Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Inconsistencies by Abductive Reflection", "paper_summary": "Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI could be regarded as an analogy to human\ndual-process cognition, modeling the intuitive System 1 with neural networks\nand the algorithmic System 2 with symbolic reasoning. However, for complex\nlearning targets, NeSy systems often generate outputs inconsistent with domain\nknowledge and it is challenging to rectify them. Inspired by the human\nCognitive Reflection, which promptly detects errors in our intuitive response\nand revises them by invoking the System 2 reasoning, we propose to improve NeSy\nsystems by introducing Abductive Reflection (ABL-Refl) based on the Abductive\nLearning (ABL) framework. ABL-Refl leverages domain knowledge to abduce a\nreflection vector during training, which can then flag potential errors in the\nneural network outputs and invoke abduction to rectify them and generate\nconsistent outputs during inference. ABL-Refl is highly efficient in contrast\nto previous ABL implementations. Experiments show that ABL-Refl outperforms\nstate-of-the-art NeSy methods, achieving excellent accuracy with fewer training\nresources and enhanced efficiency.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f\uff08NeSy\uff09\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u53ef\u4ee5\u8996\u70ba\u4eba\u985e\u96d9\u91cd\u904e\u7a0b\u8a8d\u77e5\u7684\u985e\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5efa\u6a21\u76f4\u89ba\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71 1\uff0c\u4e26\u4ee5\u7b26\u865f\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7d71 2\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u76ee\u6a19\uff0cNeSy \u7cfb\u7d71\u7d93\u5e38\u7522\u751f\u8207\u9818\u57df\u77e5\u8b58\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u96e3\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u985e\u8a8d\u77e5\u53cd\u7701\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fc5\u901f\u5075\u6e2c\u6211\u5011\u76f4\u89ba\u53cd\u61c9\u4e2d\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u547c\u53eb\u7cfb\u7d71 2 \u63a8\u7406\u4f86\u4fee\u6b63\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u900f\u904e\u5728\u6f14\u7e79\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08ABL\uff09\u67b6\u69cb\u4e2d\u5c0e\u5165\u6f14\u7e79\u53cd\u7701\uff08ABL-Refl\uff09\u4f86\u6539\u5584 NeSy \u7cfb\u7d71\u3002ABL-Refl \u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u5229\u7528\u9818\u57df\u77e5\u8b58\u6f14\u7e79\u53cd\u5c04\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a19\u8a18\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u8f38\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u932f\u8aa4\uff0c\u4e26\u547c\u53eb\u6f14\u7e79\u4f86\u4fee\u6b63\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u63a8\u8ad6\u671f\u9593\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u3002\u8207\u5148\u524d\u7684 ABL \u5be6\u4f5c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cABL-Refl \u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0cABL-Refl \u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 NeSy \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6e90\u8f03\u5c11\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u6975\u4f73\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Wen-Chao Hu et.al.", "authors": "Wen-Chao Hu, Wang-Zhou Dai, Yuan Jiang, Zhi-Hua Zhou", "id": "2412.08457v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08457v1", "repo": "null"}}

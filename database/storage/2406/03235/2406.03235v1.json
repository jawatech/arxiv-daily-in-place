Currently, students in school do not get enough speaking\nopportunities and lack conversational practice. Recent advances in speech\ntechnology and natural language processing allow for the creation of novel\ntools to practice their speaking skills. In this work, we tackle the first\ncomponent of such a pipeline, namely, the automated speech recognition module\n(ASR), which faces a number of challenges: first, state-of-the-art ASR models\nare often trained on adult read-aloud data by native speakers and do not\ntransfer well to young language learners' speech. Second, most ASR systems\ncontain a powerful language model, which smooths out errors made by the\nspeakers. To give corrective feedback, which is a crucial part of language\nlearning, the ASR systems in our setting need to preserve the errors made by\nthe language learners. In this work, we build an ASR system that satisfies\nthese requirements: it works on spontaneous speech by young language learners\nand preserves their errors. For this, we collected a corpus containing around\n85 hours of English audio spoken by learners in Switzerland from grades 4 to 6\non different language learning tasks, which we used to train an ASR model. Our\nexperiments show that our model benefits from direct fine-tuning on children's\nvoices and has a much higher error preservation rate than other models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u9700\u8981\u7df4\u7fd2\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u8aaa\u51fa\n\u9019\u9580\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5b78\u6821\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u6c92\u6709\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u8aaa\u51fa\n\u4e26\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6703\u8a71\u7df4\u7fd2\u3002\u8a9e\u97f3\u6280\u8853\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u5141\u8a31\u5275\u5efa\u65b0\u7a4e\n\u5de5\u5177\u4f86\u7df4\u7fd2\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u53e3\u8a9e\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u9019\u7a2e\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\n\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5373\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8b58\u5225\u6a21\u7d44\n(ASR)\uff0c\u5b83\u9762\u81e8\u8a31\u591a\u6311\u6230\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 ASR \u6a21\u578b\n\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u6bcd\u8a9e\u4eba\u58eb\u8a13\u7df4\u6210\u4eba\u6717\u8b80\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e14\u7121\u6cd5\u9806\u5229\u8f49\u79fb\u81f3\u5e74\u8f15\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7684\u8a9e\u97f3\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578 ASR \u7cfb\u7d71\n\u5305\u542b\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5e73\u6ed1\u51fa\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u6240\u72af\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u77ef\u6b63\u56de\u994b\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u8a9e\u8a00\n\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684 ASR \u7cfb\u7d71\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u6240\u72af\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u500b ASR \u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u6eff\u8db3\n\u9019\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\uff1a\u5b83\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u5e74\u8f15\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7684\u81ea\u767c\u6027\u8a9e\u97f3\uff0c\u4e26\u4fdd\u7559\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5305\u542b\u7d04\n85 \u5c0f\u6642\u7684\u82f1\u8a9e\u97f3\u8a0a\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\uff0c\u7531\u745e\u58eb 4 \u5230 6 \u5e74\u7d1a\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u8aaa\u51fa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7528\u5b83\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4 ASR \u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\n\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u76ca\u65bc\u5c0d\u5152\u7ae5\u8072\u97f3\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u4e14\u932f\u8aa4\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u9060\u9ad8\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Janick Michot et.al.", "authors": "Janick Michot, Manuela H\u00fcrlimann, Jan Deriu, Luzia Sauer, Katsiaryna Mlynchyk, Mark Cieliebak", "id": "2406.03235v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03235v1", "repo": "https://github.com/mict-zhaw/chall_e2e_stt"}}

However, the data heterogeneity between sources may lead models to\ngradually forget previously acquired knowledge when undergoing cross-training\nto adapt to new tasks or data sources. We argue that integrating personalized\nand global knowledge to gather information from multiple perspectives could\npotentially improve performance. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a\nnovel approach that enhances federated learning through a cross-training scheme\nincorporating multi-view information. Specifically, the proposed method, termed\nFedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge\nbroadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which\nenhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient\nfederated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation\nlearning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and\nlocal views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after\nmodel exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global\nknowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich\ninformation to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables\nthe model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were\nconducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study,\nin-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT\nalleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables\nit outperform state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u806f\u5408\u5b78\u7fd2\u53d7\u76ca\u65bc\u8de8\u8a13\u7df4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u8a13\u7df4\u4f86\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f86\u6e90\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u7570\u8cea\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9032\u884c\u8de8\u8a13\u7df4\u4ee5\u9069\u61c9\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\u6216\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u6e90\u6642\u9010\u6f38\u907a\u5fd8\u5148\u524d\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7403\u77e5\u8b58\u4ee5\u5f9e\u591a\u500b\u89d2\u5ea6\u6536\u96c6\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u9054\u6210\u9019\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u8de8\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6848\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u806f\u5408\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4e26\u7d0d\u5165\u591a\u8996\u89d2\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a31\u70ba FedCT\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8b58\u5ee3\u64ad\u6a21\u7d44\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9019\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u5ba2\u6236\u7aef\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u4e26\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u806f\u5408\u5b78\u7fd2\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u591a\u8996\u89d2\u77e5\u8b58\u5f15\u5c0e\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u7d44\u5229\u7528\u4f86\u81ea\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8996\u89d2\u7684\u878d\u5408\u539f\u578b\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u63db\u524d\u5f8c\u5c40\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u4fdd\u5b58\uff0c\u4e26\u78ba\u4fdd\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u7403\u77e5\u8b58\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u64f4\u5145\u6a21\u7d44\u5f59\u7e3d\u4e86\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u7279\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\u7684\u591a\u6a23\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5340\u5206\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u6a23\u672c\u3002\u91dd\u5c0d\u56db\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6548\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03\u3001\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\uff0cFedCT \u6e1b\u8f15\u4e86\u4f86\u81ea\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u7403\u8996\u89d2\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u907a\u5fd8\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5b83\u80fd\u5920\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Zhuang Qi et.al.", "authors": "Zhuang Qi, Lei Meng, Weihao He, Ruohan Zhang, Yu Wang, Xin Qi, Xiangxu Meng", "id": "2405.20046v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20046v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, challenges persist regarding\nthe edge deployment of generative models and the optimization of joint edge\nAI-generated content (AIGC) tasks. In this paper, we focus on the edge\noptimization of AIGC task execution and propose GMEL, a generative model-driven\nindustrial AIGC collaborative edge learning framework. This framework aims to\nfacilitate efficient few-shot learning by leveraging realistic sample synthesis\nand edge-based optimization capabilities. First, a multi-task AIGC\ncomputational offloading model is presented to ensure the efficient execution\nof heterogeneous AIGC tasks on edge servers. Then, we propose an\nattention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) algorithm aimed\nat refining offloading policies within the IoT system, thereby supporting\ngenerative model-driven edge learning. Finally, our experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing the total\nsystem latency of the edge-based AIGC task completion.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Siyuan Li et.al.", "authors": "Siyuan Li,Xi Lin,Hansong Xu,Kun Hua,Xiaomin Jin,Gaolei Li,Jianhua Li", "id": "2405.02972v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02972v1", "repo": "null"}}

Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of AI methods for accurate\nand early diagnosis of lung cancer from routine scans. However, this evidence\nhas not translated into clinical practice with one barrier being a lack of\ninterpretable models. This study investigates the application Variational\nAutoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions.\nProposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the\nLIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced\nby the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used\nin an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved\nstate-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows\nthe VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions\nbased on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient\nand malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard\nGaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces\nthe prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent\nspace with disentangled feature representation. Finally, we demonstrate the\npotential for latent space traversals corresponding to clinically meaningful\nfeature changes.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Benjamin Keel et.al.", "authors": "Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Samuel D.

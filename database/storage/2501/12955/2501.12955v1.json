Punctuation marks at the end of sentences are\nof particular importance as their distribution can determine various complexity\nfeatures of written natural language. Here, the sentence length variability\n(SLV) time series representing \"Hopscotch\" by Julio Cortazar are subjected to\nquantitative analysis with an attempt to identify their distribution type,\nlong-memory effects, and potential multiscale patterns. The analyzed novel is\nan important and innovative piece of literature whose essential property is\nfreedom of movement between its building blocks given to a reader by the\nauthor. The statistical consequences of this freedom are closely investigated\nin both the original, Spanish version of the novel, and its translations into\nEnglish and Polish. Clear evidence of rich multifractality in the SLV dynamics,\nwith a left-sided asymmetry, however, is observed in all three language\nversions as well as in the versions with differently ordered chapters.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u66f8\u9762\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5b83\u5c0d\u5176\u6574\u9ad4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u8868\u9054\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u7522\u751f\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u53e5\u5b50\u7d50\u5c3e\u7684\u6a19\u9ede\u7b26\u865f\u7279\u5225\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u4ee5\u6c7a\u5b9a\u66f8\u9762\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u5728\u6b64\uff0c\u7531\u80e1\u91cc\u5967\u00b7\u79d1\u5854\u85a9\u723e\u64b0\u5beb\u7684\u300c\u8df3\u623f\u5b50\u300d\u53e5\u5b50\u9577\u5ea6\u53ef\u8b8a\u6027 (SLV) \u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\u7d93\u904e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8a66\u5716\u8b58\u5225\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u985e\u578b\u3001\u9577\u8a18\u61b6\u6548\u61c9\u548c\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6240\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5c0f\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u90e8\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u5b78\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u5c6c\u6027\u662f\u4f5c\u8005\u8ce6\u4e88\u8b80\u8005\u7684\u69cb\u5efa\u6a21\u7d44\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u79fb\u52d5\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u7d71\u8a08\u5f8c\u679c\u5728\u5c0f\u8aaa\u7684\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8a9e\u539f\u7248\u53ca\u5176\u82f1\u6587\u548c\u6ce2\u862d\u6587\u8b6f\u672c\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u5bc6\u5207\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u7248\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ae0\u7bc0\u9806\u5e8f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u90fd\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230 SLV \u52d5\u529b\u5b78\u4e2d\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5206\u5f62\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de6\u504f\u4e0d\u5c0d\u7a31\u6027\u3002", "author": "Jakub Dec et.al.", "authors": "Jakub Dec, Micha\u0142 Dolina, Stanis\u0142aw Dro\u017cd\u017c, Jaros\u0142aw Kwapie\u0144, Tomasz Stanisz", "id": "2501.12955v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12955v1", "repo": "null"}}

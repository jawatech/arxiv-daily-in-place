{"2410.04727": {"publish_time": "2024-10-07", "title": "Forgetting Curve: A Reliable Method for Evaluating Memorization Capability for Long-context Models", "paper_summary": "Numerous recent works target to extend effective context length for language\nmodels and various methods, tasks and benchmarks exist to measure model's\neffective memorization length. However, through thorough investigations, we\nfind limitations for currently existing evaluations on model's memorization\ncapability. We provide an extensive survey for limitations in this work and\npropose a new method called forgetting curve to measure the memorization\ncapability of long-context models. We show that forgetting curve has the\nadvantage of being robust to the tested corpus and the experimental settings,\nof not relying on prompts and can be applied to any model size.\n  We apply our forgetting curve to a large variety of models involving both\ntransformer and RNN/SSM based architectures. Our measurement provides empirical\nevidence for the effectiveness of transformer extension techniques while raises\nquestions for the effective length of RNN/SSM based models. We also examine the\ndifference between our measurement and existing benchmarks as well as popular\nmetrics for various models.

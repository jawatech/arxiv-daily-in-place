{"2412.17531": {"publish_time": "2024-12-23", "title": "Double Landmines: Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks based on Dual-Trigger", "paper_summary": "At present, all textual backdoor attack methods are based on single triggers:\nfor example, inserting specific content into the text to activate the backdoor;\nor changing the abstract text features. The former is easier to be identified\nby existing defense strategies due to its obvious characteristics; the latter,\nalthough improved in invisibility, has certain shortcomings in terms of attack\nperformance, construction of poisoned datasets, and selection of the final\npoisoning rate. On this basis, this paper innovatively proposes a Dual-Trigger\nbackdoor attack based on syntax and mood, and optimizes the construction of the\npoisoned dataset and the selection strategy of the final poisoning rate. A\nlarge number of experimental results show that this method significantly\noutperforms the previous methods based on abstract features in attack\nperformance, and achieves comparable attack performance (almost 100% attack\nsuccess rate) with the insertion-based method. In addition, the two trigger\nmechanisms included in this method can be activated independently in the\napplication phase of the model, which not only improves the flexibility of the\ntrigger style, but also enhances its robustness against defense strategies.\nThese results profoundly reveal that textual backdoor attacks are extremely\nharmful and provide a new perspective for security protection in this field.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6587\u672c\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff1a\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u63d2\u5165\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u540e\u95e8\uff1b\n\u6216\u66f4\u6539\u62bd\u8c61\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u524d\u8005\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u540e\u8005\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7387\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u53cc\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7387\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u51e0\u4e4e 100% \u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u72ec\u7acb\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e6\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u6df1\u523b\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5371\u5bb3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "author": "Yang Hou et.al.", "authors": "Yang Hou, Qiuling Yue, Lujia Chai, Guozhao Liao, Wenbao Han, Wei Ou", "id": "2412.17531v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17531v1", "repo": "null"}}

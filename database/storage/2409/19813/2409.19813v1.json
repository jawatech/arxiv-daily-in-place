In this paper, we propose to employ the distributional\ntheory of meaning once again. Using Independent Component Analysis to overcome\nsome of its challenging aspects, we show that large language models represent\nsemantic features in their hidden states.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9075\u5faa\u8a31\u591a NLP \u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u8b5c\u7cfb\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u53d7\u5230\u5206\u4f48\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u518d\u8207\u5176\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u95dc\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u518d\u6b21\u63a1\u7528\u5206\u4f48\u5f0f\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u7406\u8ad6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u7368\u7acb\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u4f86\u514b\u670d\u5176\u4e00\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u96b1\u85cf\u72c0\u614b\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7279\u5fb5\u3002", "author": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Musil et.al.", "authors": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Musil, David Mare\u010dek", "id": "2409.19813v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19813v1", "repo": "null"}}

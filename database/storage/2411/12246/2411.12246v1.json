{"2411.12246": {"publish_time": "2024-11-19", "title": "Efficient Training in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Communication-Free Framework for the Box-Pushing Problem", "paper_summary": "Self-organizing systems consist of autonomous agents that can perform complex\ntasks and adapt to dynamic environments without a central controller. Prior\nresearch often relies on reinforcement learning to enable agents to gain the\nskills needed for task completion, such as in the box-pushing environment.\nHowever, when agents push from opposing directions during exploration, they\ntend to exert equal and opposite forces on the box, resulting in minimal\ndisplacement and inefficient training. This paper proposes a model called\nShared Pool of Information (SPI), which enables information to be accessible to\nall agents and facilitates coordination, reducing force conflicts among agents\nand enhancing exploration efficiency. Through computer simulations, we\ndemonstrate that SPI not only expedites the training process but also requires\nfewer steps per episode, significantly improving the agents' collaborative\neffectiveness.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u7d44\u7e54\u7cfb\u7d71\u7531\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7d44\u6210\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u5920\u57f7\u884c\u8907\u96dc\u4efb\u52d9\u4e26\u9069\u61c9\u52d5\u614b\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u4e2d\u592e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8cf4\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u5920\u7372\u5f97\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u63a8\u7bb1\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f9e\u76f8\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u63a8\u6642\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5f80\u5f80\u5c0d\u7bb1\u5b50\u65bd\u52a0\u76f8\u7b49\u4e14\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u529b\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u4f4d\u79fb\u6700\u5c0f\u4e14\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5171\u4eab\u6c60 (SPI) \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u80fd\u5920\u88ab\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5b58\u53d6\u4e26\u4fc3\u9032\u5354\u8abf\uff0c\u6e1b\u5c11\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u529b\u885d\u7a81\u4e26\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002\u900f\u904e\u96fb\u8166\u6a21\u64ec\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e SPI \u4e0d\u50c5\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u5feb\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6bcf\u96c6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6b65\u9a5f\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "David Ge et.al.", "authors": "David Ge, Hao Ji", "id": "2411.12246v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12246v1", "repo": "null"}}

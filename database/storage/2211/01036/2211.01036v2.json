However, existing\nliterature still lacks a systematic and comprehensive survey work on the use of\nXAI for IoT. To bridge this lacking, in this paper, we address the XAI\nframeworks with a focus on their characteristics and support for IoT. We\nillustrate the widely-used XAI services for IoT applications, such as security\nenhancement, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and\nInternet of City Things (IoCT). We also suggest the implementation choice of\nXAI models over IoT systems in these applications with appropriate examples and\nsummarize the key inferences for future works. Moreover, we present the\ncutting-edge development in edge XAI structures and the support of\nsixth-generation (6G) communication services for IoT applications, along with\nkey inferences. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic\ncompilation on the development of XAI-based frameworks tailored for the demands\nof future IoT use cases.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal et.al.", "authors": "Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal,Quoc-Viet Pham,Rukhsana Ruby,Zhaohui Yang,Chunmei Xu,Zhaoyang Zhang", "id": "2211.01036v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01036v2", "repo": "null"}}

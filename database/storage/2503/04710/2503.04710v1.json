Having explored various architectures for child\nspeech recognition in previous work, in this article we tackle recent\nself-supervised models. We first compare wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT and WavLM models\nadapted to phoneme recognition in French child speech, and continue our\nexperiments with the best of them, WavLM base+. We then further adapt it by\nunfreezing its transformer blocks during fine-tuning on child speech, which\ngreatly improves its performance and makes it significantly outperform our base\nmodel, a Transformer+CTC. Finally, we study in detail the behaviour of these\ntwo models under the real conditions of our application, and show that WavLM\nbase+ is more robust to various reading tasks and noise levels.

The\nFMEA approach, however, requires domain experts to manually analyse the FMEA\nmodel to derive risk-reducing actions that should be applied. In this paper, we\nprovide a formal framework to allow for automatic planning and acting in FMEA\nmodels. More specifically, we cast the FMEA model into a Markov decision\nprocess which can then be solved by existing solvers. We show that the FMEA\napproach can not only be used to support medical experts during the modelling\nprocess but also to automatically derive optimal therapies for the treatment of\npatients.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Malte Luttermann et.al.", "authors": "Malte Luttermann,Edgar Baake,Juljan Bouchagiar,Benjamin Gebel,Philipp Gr\u00fcning,Dilini Manikwadura,Franziska Schollemann,Elisa Teifke,Philipp Rostalski,Ralf M\u00f6ller", "id": "2405.03406v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03406v1", "repo": "null"}}

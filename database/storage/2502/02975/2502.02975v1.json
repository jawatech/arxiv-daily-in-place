{"2502.02975": {"publish_time": "2025-02-05", "title": "TGB-Seq Benchmark: Challenging Temporal GNNs with Complex Sequential Dynamics", "paper_summary": "Future link prediction is a fundamental challenge in various real-world\ndynamic systems. To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks\n(temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these\ndatasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential\ndynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as\nrecommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight\nhas led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning\nsequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges.\n  In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and\nDyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics,\nsuch as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow\nAI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph\nBenchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated\nto minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and\ngeneralize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets\nspanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings,\nbusiness reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks.\nBenchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant\nperformance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing\nnew challenges and opportunities for future research. TGB-Seq datasets,\nleaderboards, and example codes are available at https://tgb-seq.github.io/.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672a\u4f86\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c\u662f\u5404\u7a2e\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u52d5\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6230\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5df2\u7d93\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u6642\u5e8f\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff08\u6642\u5e8f GNN\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u904e\u591a\u7684\u91cd\u8907\u908a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u8a31\u591a\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\u548c\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u8ab0\u4f86\u8ffd\u8e64\u300d\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u758f\u5ffd\u5c0e\u81f4\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7121\u610f\u4e2d\u6de1\u5316\u4e86\u5b78\u7fd2\u9806\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u9810\u6e2c\u91cd\u8907\u7684\u908a\u3002\n\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 GraphMixer \u548c DyGFormer\uff0c\u672c\u8cea\u4e0a\u7121\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u300c\u4e00\u500b\u8ffd\u8e64 OpenAI \u548c Anthropic \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5728 Meta \u4e0a\u8ffd\u8e64 AI\u300d\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9806\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u6642\u5e8f\u5716\u57fa\u6e96\uff08TGB-Seq\uff09\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7d93\u904e\u4ed4\u7d30\u7b56\u5283\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u8907\u7684\u908a\uff0c\u6311\u6230\u6a21\u578b\u5b78\u7fd2\u9806\u5e8f\u52d5\u614b\u4e26\u63a8\u5ee3\u5230\u672a\u898b\u7684\u908a\u3002TGB-Seq \u5305\u542b\u6db5\u84cb\u4e0d\u540c\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96fb\u5b50\u5546\u52d9\u4e92\u52d5\u3001\u96fb\u5f71\u8a55\u5206\u3001\u5546\u696d\u8a55\u8ad6\u3001\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8def\u3001\u5f15\u6587\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u7db2\u8def\u9023\u7d50\u7db2\u8def\u3002\u57fa\u6e96\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728 TGB-Seq \u4e0a\u906d\u53d7\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e26\u7522\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6230\u548c\u6a5f\u6703\u3002TGB-Seq \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3001\u6392\u884c\u699c\u548c\u7bc4\u4f8b\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u53ef\u5728 https://tgb-seq.github.io/ \u53d6\u5f97\u3002", "author": "Lu Yi et.al.", "authors": "Lu Yi, Jie Peng, Yanping Zheng, Fengran Mo, Zhewei Wei, Yuhang Ye, Yue Zixuan, Zengfeng Huang", "id": "2502.02975v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02975v1", "repo": "null"}}

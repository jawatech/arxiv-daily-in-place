However, soft constraints are semantically\nrelated and difficult to verify through automated methods. These constraints\nremain a significant challenge for LLMs. To enhance the ability of LLMs to\nfollow soft constraints, we initially design a pipeline to obtain high-quality\noutputs automatically. Additionally, to fully utilize the acquired data, we\nintroduce a training paradigm based on curriculum learning. We experimentally\nevaluate the effectiveness of our methods in improving LLMs' soft constraint\nfollowing ability and analyze the factors driving the improvements.

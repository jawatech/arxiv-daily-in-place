It is elusive, however, due to the fact that human\ncreativity is not fully understood and, thus, it is difficult to develop this\ncapability in software. Large language models (LLMs) provide a facsimile of\ncreativity and the appearance of sentience, while not actually being either\ncreative or sentient. While LLMs have created bona fide new content, in some\ncases - such as with harmful hallucinations - inadvertently, their deliberate\ncreativity is seen by some to not match that of humans. In response to this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing LLM output creativity\nvia an iterative process of concept injection and refinement. Initial work on\nthe development of the Creative Artificial Intelligence through Recurring\nDevelopments and Determinations (CAIRDD) system is presented and the efficacy\nof key system components is evaluated.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96fb\u8166\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5275\u9020\u529b\u662f\u901a\u5f80\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u6167 (AGI) \u7684\u95dc\u9375\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u5275\u9020\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u96e3\u4ee5\u6349\u6478\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8edf\u9ad4\u4e2d\u958b\u767c\u9019\u7a2e\u80fd\u529b\u4e5f\u5341\u5206\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5275\u9020\u529b\u7684\u8907\u88fd\u54c1\u548c\u77e5\u89ba\u7684\u8868\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u65e2\u4e0d\u5177\u5275\u9020\u529b\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5177\u77e5\u89ba\u3002\u96d6\u7136 LLM \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u5e7b\u89ba\uff09\u7121\u610f\u9593\u5275\u9020\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u8a8d\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u523b\u610f\u5275\u9020\u529b\u7121\u6cd5\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u76f8\u63d0\u4e26\u8ad6\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u500b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u900f\u904e\u6982\u5ff5\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u512a\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u8986\u904b\u7b97\u904e\u7a0b\u4f86\u589e\u5f37 LLM \u8f38\u51fa\u5275\u9020\u529b\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u900f\u904e\u53cd\u8986\u958b\u767c\u548c\u6c7a\u7b56 (CAIRDD) \u7cfb\u7d71\u958b\u767c\u5275\u9020\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u95dc\u9375\u7cfb\u7d71\u7d44\u4ef6\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Jeremy Straub et.al.", "authors": "Jeremy Straub, Zach Johnson", "id": "2409.02291v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02291v1", "repo": "null"}}

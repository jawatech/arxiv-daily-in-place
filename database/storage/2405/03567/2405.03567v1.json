However, these methods are currently not lightweight\nenough as well as their performance is not satisfactory. To solve these\nproblems, we propose a deep space separable distillation network. Firstly, the\nnetwork performs high-low frequency decomposition on the log-mel spectrogram,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining model\nperformance. Secondly, we specially design three lightweight operators for ASC,\nincluding Separable Convolution (SC), Orthonormal Separable Convolution (OSC),\nand Separable Partial Convolution (SPC). These operators exhibit highly\nefficient feature extraction capabilities in acoustic scene classification\ntasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a\nperformance gain of 9.8% compared to the currently popular deep learning\nmethods, while also having smaller parameter count and computational\ncomplexity.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "ShuQi Ye et.al.", "authors": "ShuQi Ye,Yuan Tian", "id": "2405.03567v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03567v1", "repo": "null"}}

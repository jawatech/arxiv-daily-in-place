Our\nposition is that many current frameworks became popular during single server\ndeployment of MVC architecture apps, and do not facilitate modern aspects of\napp development such as cloud computing and the incorporation of emerging\ntechnologies such as AI. We present a novel framework which accomplishes these\npurposes, Skeet, which was recently released to general use, alongside an\ninitial evaluation. Skeet provides an app structure that reflects current\ntrends in architecture, and tool suites that allow developers with minimal\nknowledge of AI internals to easily incorporate such technologies into their\napps and deploy them.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7db2\u9801\u548c\u884c\u52d5\u8edf\u9ad4\u67b6\u69cb\u9818\u57df\u5df2\u7d93\u76f8\u5c0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u6709\u5404\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u986f\u793a\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u95dc\u806f\u5f0f\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u958b\u767c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7acb\u5834\u662f\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u7576\u524d\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u5728 MVC \u67b6\u69cb\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u55ae\u4e00\u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u671f\u9593\u8b8a\u5f97\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7121\u6cd5\u4fc3\u9032\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u958b\u767c\u7684\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u96f2\u7aef\u904b\u7b97\u548c\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u8208\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 AI\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5be6\u73fe\u9019\u4e9b\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u67b6\u69cb Skeet\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u767c\u5e03\u4f9b\u4e00\u822c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e26\u9644\u6709\u521d\u6b65\u8a55\u4f30\u3002Skeet \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u53cd\u6620\u7576\u524d\u67b6\u69cb\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5141\u8a31\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u5728\u5c0d AI \u5167\u90e8\u7d50\u69cb\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f15\u9b06\u5730\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\u4e26\u90e8\u7f72\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u7d44\u3002", "author": "Kawasaki Fumitake et.al.", "authors": "Kawasaki Fumitake, Shota Kishi, James Neve", "id": "2405.06164v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06164v1", "repo": "null"}}

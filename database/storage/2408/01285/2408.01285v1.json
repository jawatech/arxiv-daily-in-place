While several methods have been proposed for measuring\nbias, there remains a gap between predictions, which are what the proposed\nmethods consider, and how they are used to make decisions. In this work, we\nintroduce Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI), a model-agnostic bias\nmeasure that assesses potential allocational harms arising from biases in LLM\npredictions. We compare RABBI and current bias metrics on two allocation\ndecision tasks. We evaluate their predictive validity across ten LLMs and\nutility for model selection. Our results reveal that commonly-used bias metrics\nbased on average performance gap and distribution distance fail to reliably\ncapture group disparities in allocation outcomes, whereas RABBI exhibits a\nstrong correlation with allocation disparities. Our work highlights the need to\naccount for how models are used in contexts with limited resource constraints.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u73fe\u6b63\u88ab\u8003\u616e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u652f\u63f4\u9ad8\u98a8\u96aa\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u62db\u8058\u548c\u81e8\u5e8a\u6c7a\u7b56\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7e\u7a2e\u8861\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9810\u6e2c\uff08\u9019\u662f\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u616e\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\uff09\u8207\u5b83\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u65bc\u6c7a\u7b56\u4e4b\u9593\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u6392\u540d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6307\u6a19 (RABBI)\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8207\u6a21\u578b\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8861\u91cf\u6a19\u6e96\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u7531 LLM \u9810\u6e2c\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u5206\u914d\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5169\u500b\u5206\u914d\u6c7a\u7b56\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86 RABBI \u548c\u7576\u524d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5341\u500b LLM \u4e2d\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u6548\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9078\u64c7\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5e73\u5747\u6548\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5206\u4f48\u8ddd\u96e2\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u504f\u5dee\u6307\u6a19\u7121\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5206\u914d\u7d50\u679c\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u9ad4\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u800c RABBI \u5247\u8207\u5206\u914d\u5dee\u7570\u5448\u73fe\u5f37\u76f8\u95dc\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5728\u8cc7\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "author": "Hannah Chen et.al.", "authors": "Hannah Chen, Yangfeng Ji, David Evans", "id": "2408.01285v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01285v1", "repo": "null"}}

As artificial\nintelligence-driven technologies continue to evolve and advance, the question\nof their applicability and reliability remains unresolved. This study aims to\nutilize image processing and deep learning methodologies to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results for the detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n(ALL) using data that best represents real-world scenarios. ALL is one of\nseveral types of blood cancer, and it is an aggressive form of leukemia. In\nthis investigation, we examine the most recent advancements in ALL detection,\nas well as the latest iteration of the YOLO series and its performance. We\naddress the question of whether white blood cells are malignant or benign.\nAdditionally, the proposed models can identify different ALL stages, including\nearly stages. Furthermore, these models can detect hematogones despite their\nfrequent misclassification as ALL. By utilizing advanced deep learning models,\nnamely, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, ResNet50 and Inception-ResNet-v2, the study achieves\naccuracy rates as high as 99.7%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these\nalgorithms across multiple datasets and various real-world situations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6bcf\u5e74\u6709\u6578\u5343\u4eba\u50c5\u6b7b\u65bc\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u9a45\u52d5\u6280\u8853\u6301\u7e8c\u6f14\u9032\u548c\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u5176\u9069\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u554f\u984c\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5f71\u50cf\u8655\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u5834\u666f\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u9054\u6210\u6025\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u6027\u767d\u8840\u75c5 (ALL) \u6aa2\u6e2c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7d50\u679c\u3002ALL \u662f\u6578\u7a2e\u8840\u764c\u985e\u578b\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u4fb5\u8972\u6027\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86 ALL \u6aa2\u6e2c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca YOLO \u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u53ca\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u767d\u8840\u7403\u662f\u60e1\u6027\u9084\u662f\u826f\u6027\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b58\u5225\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 ALL \u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u66f4\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6aa2\u6e2c\u5230\u8840\u7403\u6bcd\u7d30\u80de\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5b83\u5011\u7d93\u5e38\u88ab\u932f\u8aa4\u5206\u985e\u70ba ALL\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u9032\u968e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373 YOLOv8\u3001YOLOv11\u3001ResNet50 \u548c Inception-ResNet-v2\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u9ad8\u9054 99.7% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u5404\u7a2e\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "author": "Alaa Awad et.al.", "authors": "Alaa Awad, Salah A.

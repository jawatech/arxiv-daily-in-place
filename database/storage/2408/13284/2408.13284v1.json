Machine\nlearning (ML) has revolutionized data analysis and has been applied to\nmedicine, with some success, in the form of natural language processing (NLP)\nand artificial neural networks (ANN). Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an\nNLP method that automatically categorizes documents into topics. Successfully\napplying ML to orthopedic radiography could enable the creation of\ncomputer-aided decision systems for use in the clinic. We studied how an\nautomated ML pipeline could classify orthopedic trauma radiographs from\nradiologist reports. Methods: Wrist and ankle radiographs from Danderyd\nHospital in Sweden taken between 2002 and 2015, with radiologist reports. LDA\nwas used to create image labels for radiographs from the radiologist reports.\nRadiographs and labels were used to train an image recognition ANN. The ANN\noutcomes were manually reviewed to get an accurate estimate of the method's\nutility and accuracy. Results: Image Labels generated via LDA could\nsuccessfully train the ANN. The ANN reached an accuracy between 91% and 60%\ncompared to a gold standard, depending on the label. Conclusions: We found that\nLDA was unsuited to label orthopedic radiographs from reports with high\naccuracy. However, despite this, the ANN could learn to detect some features in\nradiographs with high accuracy. The study also illustrates how ML and ANN can\nbe applied to medical research.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\uff08X \u5149\uff09\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u6539\u5584\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u7684\u89e3\u8b80\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08ML\uff09\u5fb9\u5e95\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e26\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff08ANN\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u5b78\uff0c\u4e26\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6210\u529f\u3002\u6f5b\u5728\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u914d\u7f6e\uff08LDA\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e NLP \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u52d5\u5c07\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u985e\u70ba\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5c07 ML \u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u9aa8\u79d1\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5275\u5efa\u96fb\u8166\u8f14\u52a9\u6c7a\u7b56\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4f9b\u8a3a\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u52d5\u5316 ML \u7ba1\u7dda\u5982\u4f55\u5f9e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u91ab\u5e2b\u7684\u5831\u544a\u4e2d\u5c0d\u9aa8\u79d1\u5275\u50b7\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u91ab\u5e2b\u7684\u5831\u544a\uff0c\u65bc 2002 \u5e74\u81f3 2015 \u5e74\u9593\u5728\u745e\u5178 Danderyd \u91ab\u9662\u62cd\u651d\u7684\u624b\u8155\u548c\u8173\u8e1d\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u3002LDA \u7528\u65bc\u6839\u64da\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u91ab\u5e2b\u7684\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u5efa\u7acb\u5f71\u50cf\u6a19\u7c64\u3002\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u548c\u6a19\u7c64\u7528\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u5f71\u50cf\u8fa8\u8b58 ANN\u3002\u624b\u52d5\u6aa2\u95b1 ANN \u7d50\u679c\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u4f30\u8a08\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u900f\u904e LDA \u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u6a19\u7c64\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u8a13\u7df4 ANN\u3002\u8207\u9ec3\u91d1\u6a19\u6e96\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cANN \u9054\u5230\u4e86 91% \u5230 60% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u9ad4\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u6a19\u7c64\u3002\u7d50\u8ad6\uff1a\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe LDA \u4e0d\u9069\u5408\u5f9e\u5831\u544a\u4e2d\u6a19\u8a18\u9aa8\u79d1\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0cANN \u4ecd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5075\u6e2c\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u7167\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u8a72\u7814\u7a76\u9084\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86 ML \u548c ANN \u5982\u4f55\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Jakub Olczak et.al.", "authors": "Jakub Olczak, Max Gordon", "id": "2408.13284v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13284v1", "repo": "null"}}

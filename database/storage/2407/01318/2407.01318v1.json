It was described by Block and Purcel in 1946, and it was not until\n1980 that the first clinical application of MRI became available. Since that\ntime the MRI has gone through many advances and has altered the way diagnosing\nprocedures are performed. Due to its ability to improve constantly, MRI has\nbecome a commonly used practice among several specialisations in medicine.\nParticularly starting 0.55T and 7T MRI technologies have pointed out enhanced\npreservation of image detail and advanced tissue characterisation. This review\nexamines the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques into these MRI\nmodalities, disseminating and exploring the study applications. It highlights\nhow DL contributes to 0.55T and 7T MRI data, showcasing the potential of DL in\nimproving and refining these technologies. The review ends with a brief\noverview of how MRI technology will evolve in the coming years.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf (MRI) \u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u70ba\u8a3a\u65b7\u6280\u8853\u5e36\u4f86\u91cd\u5927\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7a2e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f7f\u7528\u96fb\u96e2\u8f3b\u5c04\u9032\u884c\u8a3a\u65b7\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6b64\u6280\u8853\u7531\u5e03\u6d1b\u514b\u8207\u73c0\u585e\u723e\u65bc 1946 \u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u76f4\u5230 1980 \u5e74\uff0cMRI \u624d\u9996\u6b21\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u81e8\u5e8a\u3002\u81ea\u90a3\u6642\u8d77\uff0cMRI \u7d93\u6b77\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u9032\u6b65\uff0c\u4e26\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u8a3a\u65b7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u57f7\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7531\u65bc MRI \u80fd\u6301\u7e8c\u6539\u9032\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u91ab\u5b78\u4e2d\u591a\u7a2e\u5c08\u79d1\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u6280\u8853\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5f9e 0.55T \u548c 7T MRI \u6280\u8853\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u5df2\u6307\u51fa\u589e\u5f37\u5f71\u50cf\u7d30\u7bc0\u7684\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u9032\u968e\u7d44\u7e54\u8868\u5fb5\u3002\u672c\u7bc7\u8a55\u8ad6\u63a2\u8a0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2 (DL) \u6280\u8853\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9019\u4e9b MRI \u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u50b3\u64ad\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u7814\u7a76\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u5b83\u5f37\u8abf DL \u5982\u4f55\u8ca2\u737b\u65bc 0.55T \u548c 7T MRI \u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u5c55\u793a DL \u5728\u6539\u5584\u548c\u7cbe\u9032\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u672c\u8a55\u8ad6\u6700\u5f8c\u7c21\u8981\u6982\u8ff0 MRI \u6280\u8853\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u5e7e\u5e74\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "author": "Ana Carolina Alves et.al.", "authors": "Ana Carolina Alves, Andr\u00e9 Ferreira, Behrus Puladi, Jan Egger, Victor Alves", "id": "2407.01318v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01318v1", "repo": "null"}}

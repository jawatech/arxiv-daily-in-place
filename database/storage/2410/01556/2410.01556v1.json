{"2410.01556": {"publish_time": "2024-10-02", "title": "Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency", "paper_summary": "Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple\noutputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to\nbe remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language\nmodels. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the\ntask format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present\nIntegrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in\nopen-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each\nprepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them\nconcurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their\ncorresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple\napproach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective.\nExtensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide\nrange of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA\n(+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance\ngains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases,\nindicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u57fa\u65bc\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u8907\u53d6\u6a23\u591a\u500b\u8f38\u51fa\u4e26\u9078\u51fa\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u4f5c\u70ba\u6700\u7d42\u56de\u61c9\uff0c\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u5be6\u5c0d\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5be6\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c0d\u65bc\u4efb\u52d9\u683c\u5f0f\u6709\u56b4\u683c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9019\u5927\u5e45\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9069\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u5408\u5f0f\u89e3\u78bc (ID)\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u9396\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u5728\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002ID \u7684\u904b\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u5efa\u69cb\u4e00\u7d44\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u8f38\u5165\u90fd\u4ee5\u5148\u524d\u53d6\u6a23\u904e\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u70ba\u524d\u7db4\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u540c\u6642\u8655\u7406\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u6bcf\u500b\u89e3\u78bc\u6b65\u9a5f\u4e2d\u900f\u904e\u5f59\u7e3d\u6240\u6709\u5c0d\u61c9\u9810\u6e2c\u4f86\u9078\u64c7\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u7b26\u865f\u3002\u5be6\u8cea\u4e0a\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u78bc\u76ee\u6a19\u4e2d\u96b1\u542b\u5730\u7d0d\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0cID \u6301\u7e8c\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5be6\u6027\uff0c\u5728 TruthfulQA (+11.2%)\u3001Biographies (+15.4%) \u548c LongFact (+8.5%) \u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6539\u9032\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u53d6\u6a23\u56de\u61c9\u6578\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6548\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u6703\u9010\u6f38\u64f4\u5927\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a ID \u5177\u5099\u900f\u904e\u91cd\u8907\u53d6\u6a23\u4f86\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002", "author": "Yi Cheng et.al.", "authors": "Yi Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yeyun Gong, Wen Xiao, Song Wang, Yuji Zhang, Wenjun Hou, Kaishuai Xu, Wenge Liu, Wenjie Li, Jian Jiao, Qi Chen, Peng Cheng, Wayne Xiong", "id": "2410.01556v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01556v1", "repo": "https://github.com/yicheng98/integrativedecoding"}}

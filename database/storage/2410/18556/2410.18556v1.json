The simplest metric to consider is the number of\ntrainable parameters in a model but this has previously been shown to be\ninsufficient at explaining robustness properties. A variety of other metrics,\nsuch as ones based on boundary thickness and gradient flatness have been\nproposed but have been shown to be inadequate proxies for robustness.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between a model's effective\ndimensionality, which can be thought of as model complexity, and its robustness\nproperties. We run experiments on commercial-scale models that are often used\nin real-world environments such as YOLO and ResNet. We reveal a near-linear\ninverse relationship between effective dimensionality and adversarial\nrobustness, that is models with a lower dimensionality exhibit better\nrobustness. We investigate the effect of a variety of adversarial training\nmethods on effective dimensionality and find the same inverse linear\nrelationship present, suggesting that effective dimensionality can serve as a\nuseful criterion for model selection and robustness evaluation, providing a\nmore nuanced and effective metric than parameter count or previously-tested\nmeasures.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u91cf\u5316\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u4ee5\u7528\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u9078\u64c7\u3001\u5c0d\u6297\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u958b\u767c\u548c\u9810\u671f\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u55ae\u4e00\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u70ba\u6b62\u4e00\u76f4\u96e3\u4ee5\u6349\u6478\u3002\u8981\u8003\u616e\u7684\u6700\u7c21\u55ae\u6307\u6a19\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8a13\u7df4\u53c3\u6578\u6578\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u5df2\u986f\u793a\u9019\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91cb\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u5c6c\u6027\u3002\u5df2\u7d93\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57fa\u65bc\u908a\u754c\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5e73\u5766\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u986f\u793a\u5b83\u5011\u662f\u4e0d\u9069\u7576\u7684\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\n\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7dad\u5ea6\uff08\u53ef\u4ee5\u8996\u70ba\u6a21\u578b\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\uff09\u8207\u5176\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u5c6c\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5728\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7d93\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5546\u696d\u898f\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 YOLO \u548c ResNet\uff09\u57f7\u884c\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7dad\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0d\u6297\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7dda\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u5373\u7dad\u5ea6\u8f03\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u5c0d\u6297\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c0d\u6709\u6548\u7dad\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e26\u767c\u73fe\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\u7dda\u6027\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u6709\u6548\u7dad\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u9078\u64c7\u548c\u5065\u58ef\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6a19\u6e96\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u53c3\u6578\u8a08\u6578\u6216\u5148\u524d\u6e2c\u8a66\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u66f4\u7d30\u7dfb\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u3002", "author": "David Khachaturov et.al.", "authors": "David Khachaturov, Robert Mullins", "id": "2410.18556v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18556v1", "repo": "null"}}

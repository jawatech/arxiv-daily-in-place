Inspection\ndrones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical\ninfrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh\noperation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure\nsuccessful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that\ndetermines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an\nappropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust\ninspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic\napproach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po\nbatteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration,\nwhich combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction\nmodels to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of\nthe hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset\ncomprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained\nfrom real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore\nwind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different\nprobabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in\nprobabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition,\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the\ndiagnosis of battery health-states.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jokin Alcibar et.al.", "authors": "Jokin Alcibar,Jose I.

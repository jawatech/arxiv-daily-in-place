This represents a research challenge that we\naim to address in this paper. We systematically analysed recent literature to\nidentify privacy threats in FL within IoT environments, and evaluate the\ndefensive measures that can be employed to mitigate these threats. Using a\nSystematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, we searched five publication\ndatabases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, ACM, and Science Direct), collating\nrelevant papers published between 2017 and April 2024, a period which spans\nfrom the introduction of FL until now. Guided by the PRISMA protocol, we\nselected 49 papers to focus our systematic review on. We analysed these papers,\npaying special attention to the privacy threats and defensive measures --\nspecifically within the context of IoT -- using inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria tailored to highlight recent advances and critical insights. We\nidentified various privacy threats, including inference attacks, poisoning\nattacks, and eavesdropping, along with defensive measures such as Differential\nPrivacy and Secure Multi-Party Computation. These defences were evaluated for\ntheir effectiveness in protecting privacy without compromising the functional\nintegrity of FL in IoT settings. Our review underscores the necessity for\nrobust and efficient privacy-preserving strategies tailored for IoT\nenvironments. Notably, there is a need for strategies against replay, evasion,\nand model stealing attacks. Exploring lightweight defensive measures and\nemerging technologies such as blockchain may help improve the privacy of FL in\nIoT, leading to the creation of FL models that can operate under variable\nnetwork conditions.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2 (FL) \u5728\u7269\u806f\u7db2 (IoT) \u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6578\u64da\u589e\u5f37\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u7531\u65bc IoT \u8a2d\u5099\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7cfb\u7d71\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6587\u737b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8b58\u5225 IoT \u74b0\u5883\u4e2d FL \u4e2d\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u53ef\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\u4f86\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u4e9b\u5a01\u8105\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7d71\u6587\u737b\u56de\u9867 (SLR) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u641c\u7d22\u4e86\u4e94\u500b\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\uff08Scopus\u3001IEEE Xplore\u3001Wiley\u3001ACM \u548c Science Direct\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u7406\u4e86 2017 \u5e74\u81f3 2024 \u5e74 4 \u6708\u4e4b\u9593\u767c\u8868\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u8ad6\u6587\uff0c\u9019\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\u6db5\u84cb\u4e86 FL \u7684\u5f15\u5165\u81f3\u4eca\u3002\u5728 PRISMA \u5354\u8b70\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9078\u64c7\u4e86 49 \u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u4f5c\u70ba\u7cfb\u7d71\u56de\u9867\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u8ad6\u6587\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u95dc\u6ce8\u96b1\u79c1\u5a01\u8105\u548c\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\u2014\u2014\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728 IoT \u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u2014\u2014\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5305\u542b\u548c\u6392\u9664\u6a19\u6e96\u4f86\u5f37\u8abf\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u96b1\u79c1\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u64ca\u3001\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u64ca\u548c\u7aca\u807d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5dee\u5206\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8a08\u7b97\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u65bc\u4fdd\u8b77\u96b1\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e0d\u640d\u5bb3 IoT \u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e2d FL \u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u56de\u9867\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u91dd\u5c0d IoT \u74b0\u5883\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u4fdd\u8b77\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91dd\u5c0d\u91cd\u64ad\u3001\u898f\u907f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7aca\u53d6\u653b\u64ca\u5236\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u8f15\u91cf\u7d1a\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u7b49\u65b0\u8208\u6280\u8853\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63d0\u9ad8 IoT \u4e2d FL \u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5275\u5efa\u53ef\u5728\u8b8a\u91cf\u7db2\u8def\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\u904b\u4f5c\u7684 FL \u6a21\u578b\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Adel ElZemity et.al.", "authors": "Adel ElZemity, Budi Arief", "id": "2407.18096v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18096v1", "repo": "null"}}

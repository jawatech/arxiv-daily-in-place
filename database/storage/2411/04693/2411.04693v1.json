Open Set Recognition (OSR), a pivotal facet\nfor algorithmic practicality, intends to categorize known classes while\ndenoting unknown ones as \"unknown.\" The chief challenge in OSR involves\nconcurrently mitigating risks associated with generalizing features from a\nrestricted set of known classes to numerous unknown samples and the open space\nexposure to potential unknown data. To enhance open-set SAR classification, a\nmethod called scattering kernel with reciprocal learning network is proposed.\nInitially, a feature learning framework is constructed based on reciprocal\npoint learning (RPL), establishing a bounded space for potential unknown\nclasses. This approach indirectly introduces unknown information into a learner\nconfined to known classes, thereby acquiring more concise and discriminative\nrepresentations. Subsequently, considering the variability in the imaging of\ntargets at different angles and the discreteness of components in SAR images, a\nproposal is made to design convolutional kernels based on large-sized attribute\nscattering center models. This enhances the ability to extract intrinsic\nnon-linear features and specific scattering characteristics in SAR images,\nthereby improving the discriminative features of the model and mitigating the\nimpact of imaging variations on classification performance. Experiments on the\nMSTAR datasets substantiate the superior performance of the proposed approach\ncalled ASC-RPL over mainstream methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u6709\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f91\u96f7\u9054 (SAR) \u81ea\u52d5\u76ee\u6a19\u8b58\u5225 (ATR) \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u5728\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u53d7\u9650\u65bc\u5c01\u9589\u74b0\u5883\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u963b\u7919\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u958b\u653e\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a69\u5065\u5730\u8655\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u76ee\u6a19\u985e\u5225\u3002\u958b\u653e\u96c6\u8b58\u5225 (OSR) \u662f\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5be6\u7528\u6027\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c0d\u5df2\u77e5\u985e\u5225\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5c07\u672a\u77e5\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u793a\u70ba\u300c\u672a\u77e5\u300d\u3002OSR \u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6230\u6d89\u53ca\u540c\u6642\u964d\u4f4e\u8207\u5c07\u7279\u5fb5\u5f9e\u5df2\u77e5\u985e\u5225\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u96c6\u5408\u6982\u62ec\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u77e5\u6a23\u672c\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u958b\u653e\u7a7a\u9593\u66dd\u9732\u65bc\u6f5b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u589e\u5f37\u958b\u653e\u96c6 SAR \u5206\u985e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u6563\u5c04\u6838\u8207\u4e92\u60e0\u5b78\u7fd2\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u4e92\u60e0\u9ede\u5b78\u7fd2 (RPL) \u5efa\u69cb\u7279\u5fb5\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u70ba\u6f5b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u985e\u5225\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u754c\u7a7a\u9593\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u9593\u63a5\u5c07\u672a\u77e5\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u9650\u65bc\u5df2\u77e5\u985e\u5225\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u5668\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u7372\u5f97\u66f4\u7c21\u6f54\u4e14\u5177\u5340\u8fa8\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u8003\u616e\u76ee\u6a19\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u8b8a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca SAR \u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u96e2\u6563\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u5c6c\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u8a2d\u8a08\u5377\u7a4d\u6838\u3002\u9019\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u5f9e SAR \u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5167\u5728\u975e\u7dda\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5340\u8fa8\u7279\u5fb5\u4e26\u6e1b\u8f15\u6210\u50cf\u8b8a\u5316\u5c0d\u5206\u985e\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002MSTAR \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u5be6\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 ASC-RPL \u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Xiayang Xiao et.al.", "authors": "Xiayang Xiao, Zhuoxuan Li, Ruyi Zhang, Jiacheng Chen, Haipeng Wang", "id": "2411.04693v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04693v1", "repo": "null"}}

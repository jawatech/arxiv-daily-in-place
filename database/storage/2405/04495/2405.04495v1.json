Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer\nwhat students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state\nof knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models,\nparticularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language\nmodels in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks\ngiven small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as\nteachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a\nsuite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components:\n(1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for\nevaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with\nhuman students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods.\nWe additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic model for adaptive\nteaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the\ncorrectness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across\nthree learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function\nlearning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian\nteaching models. In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform\nnon-adaptive random example selection. Our results highlight both the\ndifficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive\nmodels for solving it.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7576\u8001\u5e2b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u4f9b\u5b78\u751f\u5b78\u7fd2\u6642\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5fc5\u9808\u63d0\u4f9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u8b93\u5b78\u751f\u80fd\u5f9e\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u72c0\u614b\u9032\u6b65\u5230\u76ee\u6a19\u6982\u5ff5\u6216\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u597d\u8001\u5e2b\u5fc5\u9808\u540c\u6642\u63a8\u8ad6\u51fa\u5b78\u751f\u5df2\u7d93\u77e5\u9053\u4ec0\u9ebc\uff0c\u4e26\u6839\u64da\u5b78\u751f\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u8abf\u6574\u6559\u5b78\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8a08\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f5c\u70ba\u6559\u5b78\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u8207\u65e5\u4ff1\u589e\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\u4f5c\u70ba\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5df2\u7d93\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u9a5a\u4eba\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7d66\u4e88\u5c11\u91cf\u7bc4\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u9069\u61c9\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u70ba\u8001\u5e2b\uff0c\u80fd\u591a\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9069\u61c9\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5b78\u751f\uff1f\u70ba\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8a55\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba AdapT\u3002AdapT \u6709\u5169\u500b\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u4e00\u7d44\u6a21\u64ec Bayesian \u5b78\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u91cf\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u6559\u5b78\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(2) \u4e00\u500b\u8207\u771f\u4eba\u5b78\u751f\u4e00\u8d77\u8a55\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u63cf\u8ff0\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u4e16\u754c\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u53e6\u5916\u63d0\u51fa (3) AToM\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u6a5f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u5b83\u6703\u540c\u6642\u63a8\u8ad6\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u904e\u53bb\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e26\u91dd\u5c0d\u672a\u4f86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u6b63\u78ba\u6027\u9032\u884c\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u9818\u57df\uff08\u5206\u6578\u7b97\u8853\u3001\u82f1\u6587\u5f62\u614b\u5b78\u3001\u51fd\u6578\u5b78\u7fd2\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u64ec\u5b78\u751f\u8a55\u91cf\u4e2d\uff0cAToM \u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u512a\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u548c\u6a19\u6e96 Bayesian \u7684\u6559\u5b78\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u4eba\u9ad4\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0cAToM \u548c LLM \u90fd\u512a\u65bc\u975e\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u96a8\u6a5f\u7bc4\u4f8b\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u6559\u5b78\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u96e3\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b78\u7fd2\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002", "author": "Alexis Ross et.al.", "authors": "Alexis Ross, Jacob Andreas", "id": "2405.04495v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04495v1", "repo": "null"}}

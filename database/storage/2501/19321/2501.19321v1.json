Recently, large\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models such as XLS-R have utilised SSL to\ntrain on over one hundred different languages simultaneously. However, deeper\ninvestigation shows that the bulk of the training data for XLS-R comes from a\nsmall number of languages. Biases learned through SSL have been shown to exist\nin multiple domains, but language bias in multilingual SSL ASR has not been\nthoroughly examined. In this paper, we utilise the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\n(LTH) to identify language-specific subnetworks within XLS-R and test the\nperformance of these subnetworks on a variety of different languages. We are\nable to show that when fine-tuning, XLS-R bypasses traditional linguistic\nknowledge and builds only on weights learned from the languages with the\nlargest data contribution to the pretraining data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u76e3\u7763\u5b78\u7fd2 (SSL) \u7528\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u5728\u7121\u9700\u6602\u8cb4\u8cc7\u6599\u6a19\u7c64\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u5927\u578b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58 (ASR) \u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 XLS-R\uff09\u5df2\u5229\u7528 SSL \u540c\u6642\u8a13\u7df4\u8d85\u904e\u4e00\u767e\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u986f\u793a\uff0cXLS-R \u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u81ea\u5c11\u6578\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u5df2\u8b49\u660e\u900f\u904e SSL \u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u504f\u898b\u5b58\u5728\u65bc\u591a\u500b\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5fb9\u5e95\u6aa2\u9a57\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00 SSL ASR \u4e2d\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u504f\u898b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u6a02\u900f\u5238\u5047\u8aaa (LTH) \u4f86\u8b58\u5225 XLS-R \u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u5b50\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u4e26\u6e2c\u8a66\u9019\u4e9b\u5b50\u7db2\u8def\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8abf\u6642\uff0cXLS-R \u7e5e\u904e\u50b3\u7d71\u8a9e\u8a00\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u50c5\u5efa\u69cb\u5728\u5f9e\u5c0d\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u8ca2\u737b\u6700\u5927\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u6b0a\u91cd\u4e0a\u3002", "author": "Edward Storey et.al.", "authors": "Edward Storey, Naomi Harte, Peter Bell", "id": "2501.19321v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19321v1", "repo": "null"}}

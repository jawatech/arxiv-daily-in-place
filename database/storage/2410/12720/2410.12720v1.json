The name HEnRY summarizes the project's core principles: the\nHierarchical organization of agents in a layered structure for efficient\nresource management; Efficient optimization of resources and operations to\nenhance overall performance; Reactive ability of agents to quickly respond to\nenvironmental stimuli; and Yielding adaptability and flexibility of agents to\nhandle unexpected situations. The discussion covers two distinct research\npaths: the first focuses on the system architecture, and the second on the\ncollaboration between agents. This work is not limited to the specific\nstructure of the Intesa Sanpaolo context; instead, it leverages existing\nresearch in MAS to introduce a new solution. Since Intesa Sanpaolo is organized\naccording to a model that aligns with international corporate governance best\npractices, this approach could also be relevant to similar scenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6b64\u5c08\u6848\u540d\u70ba HEnRY\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u70ba Intesa Sanpaolo \u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71 (MAS)\u3002HEnRY \u9019\u500b\u540d\u7a31\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e86\u5c08\u6848\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5247\uff1a\u4ee5\u5206\u5c64\u7d50\u69cb\u5206\u5c64\u7d44\u7e54\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u8cc7\u6e90\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u8cc7\u6e90\u548c\u4f5c\u696d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\uff1b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u61c9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u56de\u61c9\u74b0\u5883\u523a\u6fc0\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u529b\u548c\u9748\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8655\u7406\u610f\u5916\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u8a0e\u8ad6\u6db5\u84cb\u5169\u689d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9014\u5f91\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u7cfb\u7d71\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u500b\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u3002\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u9650\u65bc Intesa Sanpaolo \u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7d50\u69cb\uff1b\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528 MAS \u4e2d\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u5f15\u9032\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7531\u65bc Intesa Sanpaolo \u7684\u7d44\u7e54\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b26\u5408\u570b\u969b\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u6700\u4f73\u5be6\u52d9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u8207\u985e\u4f3c\u60c5\u5883\u76f8\u95dc\u3002", "author": "Emmanuele Lacavalla et.al.", "authors": "Emmanuele Lacavalla, Shuyi Yang, Riccardo Crupi, Joseph E.

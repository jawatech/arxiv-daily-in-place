However, previous studies\nfound the issues of overreliance on `wrong' AI outputs. In this paper, we\npropose interactive example-based explanations to improve health professionals'\nonboarding with AI for their better reliance on AI during AI-assisted\ndecision-making. We implemented an AI-based decision support system that\nutilizes a neural network to assess the quality of post-stroke survivors'\nexercises and interactive example-based explanations that systematically\nsurface the nearest neighborhoods of a test/task sample from the training set\nof the AI model to assist users' onboarding with the AI model. To investigate\nthe effect of interactive example-based explanations, we conducted a study with\ndomain experts, health professionals to evaluate their performance and reliance\non AI. Our interactive example-based explanations during onboarding assisted\nhealth professionals in having a better reliance on AI and making a higher\nratio of making `right' decisions and a lower ratio of `wrong' decisions than\nproviding only feature-based explanations during the decision-support phase.\nOur study discusses new challenges of assisting user's onboarding with AI for\nhuman-AI collaborative decision-making.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u8207 AI \u5354\u4f5c\u6c7a\u7b56\u6642\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 AI \u89e3\u91cb\u5c0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u6c7a\u7b56\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u73fe\u904e\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8cf4\u300c\u932f\u8aa4\u300d\u7684 AI \u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u7bc4\u4f8b\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u91ab\u7642\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u8207 AI \u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u5728 AI \u8f14\u52a9\u6c7a\u7b56\u6642\u80fd\u66f4\u4f9d\u8cf4 AI\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc AI \u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u652f\u63f4\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u98a8\u5f8c\u5016\u5b58\u8005\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u4e26\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u7bc4\u4f8b\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u5f9e AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u6e2c\u8a66/\u4efb\u52d9\u7bc4\u4f8b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u9130\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u5354\u52a9\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8207 AI \u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u7bc4\u4f8b\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u627e\u4f86\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u548c\u91ab\u7642\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u8a55\u4f30\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u8207\u5c0d AI \u7684\u4f9d\u8cf4\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6574\u5408\u671f\u9593\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u7bc4\u4f8b\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u5354\u52a9\u91ab\u7642\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u66f4\u4f9d\u8cf4 AI\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u6c7a\u7b56\u652f\u63f4\u968e\u6bb5\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u300c\u6b63\u78ba\u300d\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8f03\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u505a\u51fa\u300c\u932f\u8aa4\u300d\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8f03\u4f4e\uff0c\u512a\u65bc\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u65bc\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u8207 AI \u5354\u4f5c\u6c7a\u7b56\u6642\uff0c\u5354\u52a9\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8207 AI \u6574\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Min Hun Lee et.al.", "authors": "Min Hun Lee, Renee Bao Xuan Ng, Silvana Xinyi Choo, Shamala Thilarajah", "id": "2409.15814v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15814v1", "repo": "null"}}

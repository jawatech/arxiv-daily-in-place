However, deep\nlearning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, presenting significant\nsecurity risks to autonomous driving systems. Presently, end-to-end\narchitectures have emerged as the predominant solution for autonomous driving,\nowing to their collaborative nature across different tasks. Yet, the\nimplications of adversarial attacks on such models remain relatively\nunexplored. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive adversarial security\nresearch on the modular end-to-end autonomous driving model for the first time.\nWe thoroughly consider the potential vulnerabilities in the model inference\nprocess and design a universal attack scheme through module-wise noise\ninjection. We conduct large-scale experiments on the full-stack autonomous\ndriving model and demonstrate that our attack method outperforms previous\nattack methods. We trust that our research will offer fresh insights into\nensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u4e2d\u7684\u8a31\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u90fd\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u5c0d\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7cfb\u7d71\u69cb\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u69cb\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5354\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u8cea\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u4ecd\u76f8\u5c0d\u672a\u7d93\u63a2\u8a0e\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u6b21\u5c0d\u6a21\u7d44\u5316\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5fb9\u5e95\u8003\u616e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u6a21\u7d44\u5316\u96dc\u8a0a\u6ce8\u5165\u8a2d\u8a08\u901a\u7528\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5168\u5806\u758a\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4e26\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c07\u70ba\u78ba\u4fdd\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002", "author": "Lu Wang et.al.", "authors": "Lu Wang, Tianyuan Zhang, Yikai Han, Muyang Fang, Ting Jin, Jiaqi Kang", "id": "2409.07706v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07706v1", "repo": "null"}}

Evaluating the ICL ability of LLMs can enhance their utilization and\ndeepen our understanding of how this ability is acquired at the training stage.\nHowever, existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on language abilities\nand knowledge, often overlooking the assessment of ICL ability. In this work,\nwe introduce the ICLEval benchmark to evaluate the ICL abilities of LLMs, which\nencompasses two key sub-abilities: exact copying and rule learning. Through the\nICLEval benchmark, we demonstrate that ICL ability is universally present in\ndifferent LLMs, and model size is not the sole determinant of ICL efficacy.\nSurprisingly, we observe that ICL abilities, particularly copying, develop\nearly in the pretraining process and stabilize afterward.

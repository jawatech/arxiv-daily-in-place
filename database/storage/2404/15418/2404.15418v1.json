The study is based on demographic data obtained from Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) from both admissions and\ndischarge data from drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers in Oklahoma.\nDemographic data is highly categorical which led to binary encoding being used\nand various fairness measures being utilized to mitigate bias of nine\ndemographic variables. Kernel methods such as linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and\nradial basis functions were compared using support vector machines at various\nparameter ranges to find the optimal values. These were then compared to\nmethods such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Synthetic\nMinority Oversampling Technique Nominal (SMOTEN) for categorical data was used\nto balance the data with imputation for missing data. The nine bias variables\nwere then intersectionalized to mitigate bias and the dual and triple\ninteractions were integrated to use the probabilities to look at worst case\nratio fairness mitigation. Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity difference,\nConditional Statistical Parity Ratio, Demographic Parity, Demographic Parity\nRatio, Equalized Odds, Equalized Odds Ratio, Equal Opportunity, and Equalized\nOpportunity Ratio were all explored at both the binary and multiclass\nscenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Karen Roberts-Licklider et.al.", "authors": "Karen Roberts-Licklider,Theodore Trafalis", "id": "2404.15418v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15418v1", "repo": "null"}}

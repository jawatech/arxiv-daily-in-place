By converting the frequent pattern mining task into a\nclassification problem, the SVM model is introduced to improve the accuracy and\nrobustness of pattern extraction. In terms of method design, the kernel\nfunction is used to map the data to a high-dimensional feature space, so as to\nconstruct the optimal classification hyperplane, realize the nonlinear\nseparation of patterns and the accurate mining of frequent items. In the\nexperiment, two public datasets, Retail and Mushroom, were selected to compare\nand analyze the proposed algorithm with traditional FP-Growth, FP-Tree,\ndecision tree and random forest models. The experimental results show that the\nalgorithm in this paper is significantly better than the traditional model in\nterms of three key indicators: support, confidence and lift, showing strong\npattern recognition ability and rule extraction effect. The study shows that\nthe SVM model has excellent performance advantages in an environment with high\ndata sparsity and a large number of transactions, and can effectively cope with\ncomplex pattern mining tasks. At the same time, this paper also points out the\npotential direction of future research, including the introduction of deep\nlearning and ensemble learning frameworks to further improve the scalability\nand adaptability of the algorithm. This research not only provides a new idea\nfor frequent pattern mining, but also provides important technical support for\nsolving pattern discovery and association rule mining problems in practical\napplications.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f (SVM) \u7684\u983b\u7e41\u6a21\u5f0f\u6578\u64da\u6316\u6398\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u50b3\u7d71\u983b\u7e41\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6578\u64da\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u74f6\u9838\u3002\u901a\u904e\u5c07\u983b\u7e41\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52d9\u8f49\u63db\u70ba\u5206\u985e\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 SVM \u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8a2d\u8a08\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6578\u5c07\u6578\u64da\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u7279\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u69cb\u9020\u6700\u512a\u5206\u985e\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u975e\u7dda\u6027\u5206\u96e2\u548c\u983b\u7e41\u9805\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6316\u6398\u3002\u5728\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u9078\u53d6\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u516c\u958b\u6578\u64da\u96c6 Retail \u548c Mushroom\uff0c\u5c0d\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u7684 FP-Growth\u3001FP-Tree\u3001\u6c7a\u7b56\u6a39\u548c\u96a8\u6a5f\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f03\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5ea6\u4e09\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u6307\u6a19\u4e0a\u5747\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8b58\u5225\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u898f\u5247\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cSVM \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6578\u64da\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u512a\u7570\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u61c9\u5c0d\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5b78\u7fd2\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u50c5\u70ba\u983b\u7e41\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u89e3\u6c7a\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u767c\u73fe\u548c\u95dc\u806f\u898f\u5247\u6316\u6398\u554f\u984c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6280\u8853\u652f\u6490\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Pochun Li et.al.", "authors": "Pochun Li", "id": "2412.15593v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15593v1", "repo": "null"}}

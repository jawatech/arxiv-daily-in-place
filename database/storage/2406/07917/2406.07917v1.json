{"2406.07917": {"publish_time": "2024-06-12", "title": "Graph Transductive Defense: a Two-Stage Defense for Graph Membership Inference Attacks", "paper_summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become instrumental in diverse real-world\napplications, offering powerful graph learning capabilities for tasks such as\nsocial networks and medical data analysis. Despite their successes, GNNs are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, including membership inference attacks\n(MIA), which threaten privacy by identifying whether a record was part of the\nmodel's training data. While existing research has explored MIA in GNNs under\ngraph inductive learning settings, the more common and challenging graph\ntransductive learning setting remains understudied in this context. This paper\naddresses this gap and proposes an effective two-stage defense, Graph\nTransductive Defense (GTD), tailored to graph transductive learning\ncharacteristics. The gist of our approach is a combination of a train-test\nalternate training schedule and flattening strategy, which successfully reduces\nthe difference between the training and testing loss distributions. Extensive\nempirical results demonstrate the superior performance of our method (a\ndecrease in attack AUROC by $9.42\\%$ and an increase in utility performance by\n$18.08\\%$ on average compared to LBP), highlighting its potential for seamless\nintegration into various classification models with minimal overhead.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5716\u5f62\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u5404\u7a2e\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u70ba\u793e\u4ea4\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u91ab\u7642\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u4efb\u52d9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u5b78\u7fd2\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0cGNN \u4ecd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6210\u54e1\u63a8\u8ad6\u653b\u64ca (MIA)\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u900f\u904e\u8fa8\u8b58\u8a18\u9304\u662f\u5426\u70ba\u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4f86\u5a01\u8105\u96b1\u79c1\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u73fe\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u63a2\u8a0e\u5716\u5f62\u6b78\u7d0d\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684 GNN \u4e2d\u7684 MIA\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u5e38\u898b\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u8f49\u5c0e\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u672a\u7372\u5f97\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e\u6b64\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5169\u968e\u6bb5\u9632\u79a6\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u5716\u5f62\u8f49\u5c0e\u9632\u79a6 (GTD)\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u91dd\u5c0d\u5716\u5f62\u8f49\u5c0e\u5b78\u7fd2\u7279\u6027\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\u3002\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8981\u9ede\u662f\u7d50\u5408\u8a13\u7df4\u6e2c\u8a66\u4ea4\u66ff\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u7a0b\u548c\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7e2e\u5c0f\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6e2c\u8a66\u640d\u5931\u5206\u4f48\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5dee\u7570\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u8b49\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u512a\u7570\u6548\u80fd\uff08\u8207 LBP \u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u653b\u64ca AUROC \u6e1b\u5c11 9.42%\uff0c\u6548\u7528\u6548\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u589e\u52a0 18.08%\uff09\uff0c\u7a81\u986f\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7121\u7e2b\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u958b\u92b7\u6975\u5c0f\u3002", "author": "Peizhi Niu et.al.", "authors": "Peizhi Niu, Chao Pan, Siheng Chen, Olgica Milenkovic", "id": "2406.07917v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07917v1", "repo": "null"}}

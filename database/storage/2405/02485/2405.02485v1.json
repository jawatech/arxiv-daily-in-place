Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical\ndiagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring\ncapabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as\npromoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively\nlabeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many\nbarriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation,\nprivacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical\nconsiderations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data\nis to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past\nexperiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning.\nThis survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning\nmethods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and\nlimitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional\ndata-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current\nlandscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications\nfor future research and applications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Chenqi Li et.al.", "authors": "Chenqi Li,Timothy Denison,Tingting Zhu", "id": "2405.02485v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02485v1", "repo": "null"}}

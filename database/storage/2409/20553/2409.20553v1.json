{"2409.20553": {"publish_time": "2024-09-30", "title": "Maia-2: A Unified Model for Human-AI Alignment in Chess", "paper_summary": "There are an increasing number of domains in which artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems both surpass human ability and accurately model human behavior.\nThis introduces the possibility of algorithmically-informed teaching in these\ndomains through more relatable AI partners and deeper insights into human\ndecision-making. Critical to achieving this goal, however, is coherently\nmodeling human behavior at various skill levels. Chess is an ideal model system\nfor conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich\nhistory as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like\nAlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous\nwork in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent\nmodels to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack\ncoherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement\nand are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching\ntools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI\nalignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill\nlevels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex,\nnon-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention\nmechanism to dynamically integrate players' strengths with encoded chess\npositions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly\nenhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of\nexpertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making\nand AI-guided teaching tools.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u7cfb\u7d71\u65e2\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u985e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u6e96\u78ba\u6a21\u64ec\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6578\u91cf\u6b63\u4e0d\u65b7\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9019\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u901a\u904e\u66f4\u5177\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u7684 AI \u5408\u4f5c\u5925\u4f34\u548c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u77e5\u60c5\u6559\u5b78\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u6b64\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u5728\u65bc\u4ee5\u9023\u8cab\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6a21\u64ec\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u80fd\u7d1a\u5225\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u897f\u6d0b\u68cb\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e\u4eba\u6a5f\u5c0d\u9f4a\u9032\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b83\u4f5c\u70ba AI \u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u6e2c\u8a66\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u64c1\u6709\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\uff0c\u6210\u719f\u7684\u8d85\u4eba\u985e AI \u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 AlphaZero\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u904e\u897f\u6d0b\u68cb\u8a55\u5206\u7cfb\u7d71\u9032\u884c\u7684\u7cbe\u78ba\u6280\u80fd\u6e2c\u91cf\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5728\u897f\u6d0b\u68cb\u4e2d\u6a21\u64ec\u4eba\u985e\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u7368\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u80fd\u7d1a\u5225\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u9069\u61c9\u4eba\u985e\u9032\u6b65\u5168\u5149\u8b5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9023\u8cab\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6700\u7d42\u5728\u4f5c\u70ba AI \u5408\u4f5c\u5925\u4f34\u548c\u6559\u5b78\u5de5\u5177\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u897f\u6d0b\u68cb\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u6a5f\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u5b83\u4ee5\u9023\u8cab\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u80fd\u7d1a\u5225\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u4e26\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u8a8d\u8b58\u5230\u4eba\u985e\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u3001\u975e\u7dda\u6027\u672c\u8cea\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u52d5\u614b\u6574\u5408\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u512a\u52e2\u8207\u7de8\u78bc\u897f\u6d0b\u68cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u5c0d\u4e0d\u65b7\u8b8a\u5316\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u6280\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u53cd\u61c9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u986f\u8457\u589e\u5f37\u4e86 AI \u548c\u4eba\u985e\u73a9\u5bb6\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5c08\u696d\u7d1a\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u70ba\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u985e\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c AI \u6307\u5c0e\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u5de5\u5177\u92ea\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Zhenwei Tang et.al.", "authors": "Zhenwei Tang, Difan Jiao, Reid McIlroy-Young, Jon Kleinberg, Siddhartha Sen, Ashton Anderson", "id": "2409.20553v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20553v1", "repo": "null"}}

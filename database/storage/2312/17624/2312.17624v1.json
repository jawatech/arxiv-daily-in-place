AI has shown advantaged accuracy but suffers\nfrom the lack of explainability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an\neXplainable Multimodal Mortality Predictor (X-MMP) approaching an efficient,\nexplainable AI solution for predicting in-hospital mortality via multimodal ICU\ndata. We employ multimodal learning in our framework, which can receive\nheterogeneous inputs from clinical data and make decisions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an explainable method, namely Layer-Wise Propagation to Transformer,\nas a proper extension of the LRP method to Transformers, producing explanations\nover multimodal inputs and revealing the salient features attributed to\nprediction. Moreover, the contribution of each modality to clinical outcomes\ncan be visualized, assisting clinicians in understanding the reasoning behind\ndecision-making. We construct a multimodal dataset based on MIMIC-III and\nMIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset. Comprehensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve\nreasonable interpretation with competitive prediction accuracy. In particular,\nour framework can be easily transferred to other clinical tasks, which\nfacilitates the discovery of crucial factors in healthcare research.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Xingqiao Li et.al.", "authors": "Xingqiao Li,Jindong Gu,Zhiyong Wang,Yancheng Yuan,Bo Du,Fengxiang He", "id": "2312.17624v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17624v1", "repo": "https://github.com/lixingqiao/xai-icu"}}

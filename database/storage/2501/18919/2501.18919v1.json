{"2501.18919": {"publish_time": "2025-01-31", "title": "Deepfake Detection of Singing Voices With Whisper Encodings", "paper_summary": "The deepfake generation of singing vocals is a concerning issue for artists\nin the music industry. In this work, we propose a singing voice deepfake\ndetection (SVDD) system, which uses noise-variant encodings of open-AI's\nWhisper model. As counter-intuitive as it may sound, even though the Whisper\nmodel is known to be noise-robust, the encodings are rich in non-speech\ninformation, and are noise-variant. This leads us to evaluate Whisper encodings\nas feature representations for the SVDD task. Therefore, in this work, the SVDD\ntask is performed on vocals and mixtures, and the performance is evaluated in\n\\%EER over varying Whisper model sizes and two classifiers- CNN and ResNet34,\nunder different testing conditions.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u8072\u6b4c\u5531\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u507d\u9020\u751f\u6210\u5c0d\u97f3\u6a02\u7522\u696d\u7684\u85dd\u8853\u5bb6\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4ee4\u4eba\u64d4\u6182\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6b4c\u5531\u8072\u97f3\u6df1\u5ea6\u507d\u9020\u5075\u6e2c (SVDD) \u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528 open-AI \u7684 Whisper \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96dc\u8a0a\u8b8a\u7570\u7de8\u78bc\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 Whisper \u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u77e5\u5c0d\u96dc\u8a0a\u5177\u6709\u9b6f\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7de8\u78bc\u5bcc\u542b\u975e\u8a9e\u97f3\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u662f\u96dc\u8a0a\u8b8a\u7570\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u807d\u8d77\u4f86\u53ef\u80fd\u9055\u53cd\u76f4\u89ba\u3002\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30 Whisper \u7de8\u78bc\u4f5c\u70ba SVDD \u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u8868\u793a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0cSVDD \u4efb\u52d9\u5728\u4eba\u8072\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u97f3\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8a55\u4f30\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 Whisper \u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5169\u500b\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff08CNN \u548c ResNet34\uff09\u4e0a \\%EER \u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Falguni Sharma et.al.", "authors": "Falguni Sharma, Priyanka Gupta", "id": "2501.18919v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18919v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, the development of KG-based RSs capable of processing\nuser inputs in natural language faces significant challenges. Firstly, natural\nlanguage processing units must effectively handle the ambiguity and variability\nin human language to interpret user intents accurately. Secondly, the system\nmust precisely identify and link entities, like product names, to their\ncorresponding nodes in KGs. To overcome these challenges, supported by Lenovo,\nwe developed a novel chatbot called \"Prometheus,\" which integrates a KG with a\nlarge language model (LLM), specifically designed for recommending computer\ncomponents. This chatbot can accurately decode user requests and deliver\npersonalized recommendations derived from KGs, ensuring precise comprehension\nand response to their computer setup needs.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u5728\u7db2\u8def\u6bd4\u5c0d\u3001\u554f\u7b54\u548c\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71 (RS) \u7b49\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63a8\u65b7\u9593\u63a5\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u958b\u767c\u80fd\u5920\u8655\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u65bc KG \u7684 RS \u6703\u9762\u81e8\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6230\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u55ae\u5143\u5fc5\u9808\u6709\u6548\u8655\u7406\u4eba\u985e\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u7fa9\u548c\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u89e3\u8b80\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u610f\u5716\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u5fc5\u9808\u7cbe\u78ba\u8b58\u5225\u548c\u9023\u7d50\u5be6\u9ad4\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7522\u54c1\u540d\u7a31\uff0c\u5230 KG \u4e2d\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u7bc0\u9ede\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5728\u806f\u60f3\u7684\u652f\u63f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba\u300c\u666e\u7f85\u7c73\u4fee\u65af\u300d\u7684\u65b0\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07 KG \u8207\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6574\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u7528\u65bc\u63a8\u85a6\u96fb\u8166\u7d44\u4ef6\u3002\u9019\u500b\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u89e3\u78bc\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f9e KG \u4e2d\u884d\u751f\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u63a8\u85a6\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u6e96\u78ba\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u56de\u61c9\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d\u96fb\u8166\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "author": "Yunsheng Wang et.al.", "authors": "Yunsheng Wang, Songhao Chen, Kevin Jin", "id": "2407.19643v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19643v1", "repo": "https://github.com/iamryanshengwang/prometheus-chatbot"}}

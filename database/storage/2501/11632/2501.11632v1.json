{"2501.11632": {"publish_time": "2025-01-20", "title": "Biomedical Knowledge Graph: A Survey of Domains, Tasks, and Real-World Applications", "paper_summary": "Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as powerful tools for\norganizing and leveraging the vast and complex data found across the biomedical\nfield. Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains\nor methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological\nprogress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a\nsystematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and\napplications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data\nsources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and\nclinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs,\nfocusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation.\nFinally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug\ndiscovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of\nBKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified\nframework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but\nalso establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative\nmethodological advances and practical implementations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (BKG) \u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u7d44\u7e54\u548c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u767c\u73fe\u7684\u9f90\u5927\u4e14\u8907\u96dc\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c0d BKG \u7684\u56de\u9867\u901a\u5e38\u5c07\u5176\u7bc4\u570d\u9650\u5236\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u6216\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5ffd\u8996\u4e86\u66f4\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u9818\u57df\u548c\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u5b83\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6280\u8853\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6b21\u8abf\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5f9e\u4e09\u500b\u6838\u5fc3\u89c0\u9ede\uff1a\u9818\u57df\u3001\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b BKG \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u56de\u9867\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u63a2\u8a0e\u5982\u4f55\u5f9e\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u6e90\u69cb\u5efa BKG\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5b50\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u85e5\u7406\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u81e8\u5e8a\u8a18\u9304\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6 BKG \u80fd\u57f7\u884c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u95dc\u6ce8\u77e5\u8b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u6aa2\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8a6e\u91cb\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u91cd\u9ede\u4ecb\u7d39\u7cbe\u6e96\u91ab\u5b78\u3001\u85e5\u7269\u767c\u73fe\u548c\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e BKG \u5728\u591a\u500b\u90e8\u9580\u7684\u8f49\u8b6f\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u89c0\u9ede\u7d9c\u5408\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u8abf\u67e5\u4e0d\u50c5\u91d0\u6e05\u4e86 BKG \u7814\u7a76\u7684\u73fe\u72c0\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\u9032\u5c55\u548c\u5be6\u52d9\u5be6\u65bd\u3002", "author": "Yuxing Lu et.al.", "authors": "Yuxing Lu, Sin Yee Goi, Xukai Zhao, Jinzhuo Wang", "id": "2501.11632v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11632v1", "repo": "null"}}

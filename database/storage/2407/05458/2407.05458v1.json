{"2407.05458": {"publish_time": "2024-07-07", "title": "A Survey of Models for Cognitive Diagnosis: New Developments and Future Directions", "paper_summary": "Cognitive diagnosis has been developed for decades as an effective\nmeasurement tool to evaluate human cognitive status such as ability level and\nknowledge mastery. It has been applied to a wide range of fields including\neducation, sport, psychological diagnosis, etc. By providing better awareness\nof cognitive status, it can serve as the basis for personalized services such\nas well-designed medical treatment, teaching strategy and vocational training.\nThis paper aims to provide a survey of current models for cognitive diagnosis,\nwith more attention on new developments using machine learning-based methods.\nBy comparing the model structures, parameter estimation algorithms, model\nevaluation methods and applications, we provide a relatively comprehensive\nreview of the recent trends in cognitive diagnosis models. Further, we discuss\nfuture directions that are worthy of exploration. In addition, we release two\nPython libraries: EduData for easy access to some relevant public datasets we\nhave collected, and EduCDM that implements popular CDMs to facilitate both\napplications and research purposes.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a8d\u77e5\u8a3a\u65b7\u5df2\u767c\u5c55\u6578\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30\u4eba\u985e\u8a8d\u77e5\u72c0\u614b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u638c\u63e1\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6e2c\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u5df2\u88ab\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u9ad4\u80b2\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u8a3a\u65b7\u7b49\u3002\u900f\u904e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c0d\u8a8d\u77e5\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u670d\u52d9\u7684\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u6cbb\u7642\u3001\u6559\u5b78\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8077\u696d\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8a8d\u77e5\u8a3a\u65b7\u7576\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d9c\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e26\u66f4\u95dc\u6ce8\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u900f\u904e\u6bd4\u8f03\u6a21\u578b\u7d50\u69cb\u3001\u53c3\u6578\u4f30\u8a08\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u8a8d\u77e5\u8a3a\u65b7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8da8\u52e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5c0d\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56de\u9867\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u503c\u5f97\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u5e03\u4e86\u5169\u500b Python \u7a0b\u5f0f\u5eab\uff1aEduData\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8f15\u9b06\u5b58\u53d6\u6211\u5011\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f8\u95dc\u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca EduCDM\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5be6\u4f5c\u71b1\u9580\u7684 CDM\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u9032\u61c9\u7528\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u3002", "author": "Fei Wang et.al.", "authors": "Fei Wang, Weibo Gao, Qi Liu, Jiatong Li, Guanhao Zhao, Zheng Zhang, Zhenya Huang, Mengxiao Zhu, Shijin Wang, Wei Tong, Enhong Chen", "id": "2407.05458v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05458v1", "repo": "null"}}

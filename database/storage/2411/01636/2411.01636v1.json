The system\nis designed to address factors such as demand, competitor pricing, and other\nexternal circumstances in real-time. Both controlled simulation and real-life\napplication showed a respectable gain of 22% in revenue generation and a 17%\nimprovement in pricing response time which concern the issues of scaling and\nflexibility of classical pricing mechanisms. Demand forecasting, competitor\npricing strategies, and event-based pricing were implemented as separate\nmicroservices to enhance their scalability and reduce resource consumption by\n30% during peak loads. Customers were also more content as depicted by a 15%\nincrease in satisfaction score post-implementation given the appreciation of\nmore appropriate pricing. This research enhances the existing literature with\npractical illustrations of the possible application of microservices technology\nin developing dynamic pricing solutions in a complex and data-driven context.\nThere exist however areas for improvement for instance inter-service latency\nand the need for extensive real-time data pipelines. The present research goes\non to suggest combining these with direct data capture from customer behavior\nat the same time as machine learning capacity developments in pricing\nalgorithms to assist in more accurate real time pricing. It is determined that\nthe use of microservices is a reasonable and efficient model for dynamic\npricing, allowing the tourism sector to employ evidence-based and customer\ncentric pricing techniques, which ensures that their profits are not\njeopardized because of the need for customers.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e00\u500b\u5373\u6642\u3001\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u5b9a\u50f9\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u65c5\u904a\u696d\u3002\u6b64\u7cfb\u7d71\u65e8\u5728\u5373\u6642\u8655\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7af6\u722d\u5c0d\u624b\u5b9a\u50f9\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5916\u90e8\u74b0\u5883\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u64ec\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u5747\u986f\u793a\u71df\u6536\u7522\u751f\u589e\u52a022%\uff0c\u5b9a\u50f9\u53cd\u61c9\u6642\u9593\u6539\u558417%\uff0c\u9019\u6d89\u53ca\u50b3\u7d71\u5b9a\u50f9\u6a5f\u5236\u7684\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u548c\u5f48\u6027\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9700\u6c42\u9810\u6e2c\u3001\u7af6\u722d\u5c0d\u624b\u5b9a\u50f9\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9a\u50f9\u5be6\u4f5c\u70ba\u7368\u7acb\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u4e26\u5728\u5c16\u5cf0\u8ca0\u8f09\u671f\u9593\u6e1b\u5c1130%\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u5ba2\u6236\u4e5f\u8f03\u70ba\u6eff\u610f\uff0c\u5f9e\u5be6\u4f5c\u5f8c\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u5206\u6578\u589e\u52a015%\u53ef\u898b\u4e00\u6591\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u66f4\u9069\u7576\u7684\u5b9a\u50f9\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u80af\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5be6\u7528\u7bc4\u4f8b\u8aaa\u660e\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u6280\u8853\u5728\u8907\u96dc\u4e14\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u958b\u767c\u52d5\u614b\u5b9a\u50f9\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u8c50\u5bcc\u4e86\u73fe\u6709\u6587\u737b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u9032\u6b65\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u670d\u52d9\u9593\u5ef6\u9072\u548c\u5c0d\u5927\u91cf\u5373\u6642\u8cc7\u6599\u7ba1\u7dda\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5efa\u8b70\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u8207\u76f4\u63a5\u5f9e\u5ba2\u6236\u884c\u70ba\u64f7\u53d6\u8cc7\u6599\u7d50\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5728\u5b9a\u50f9\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u767c\u5c55\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5354\u52a9\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u5373\u6642\u5b9a\u50f9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u78ba\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u670d\u52d9\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u5b9a\u50f9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u8b93\u65c5\u904a\u696d\u63a1\u7528\u4ee5\u8b49\u64da\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u4e14\u4ee5\u5ba2\u6236\u70ba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b9a\u50f9\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u5176\u5229\u6f64\u4e0d\u6703\u56e0\u5ba2\u6236\u9700\u6c42\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Biman Barua et.al.", "authors": "Biman Barua, M.

This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a\nsuite of four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the\nprocess by observing, analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to\nguide the search to target a potential error in the clinical notes.\nSubsequently, the MedEval agent employs five evaluators to assess the targeted\nerror and the proposed correction. In cases where MedReAct's actions prove\ninsufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging in reflective analysis\nand proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser agent formats\nthe final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the integrity of\nthe error correction process. One core component of our method is our RAG\npipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources\ncontaining clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the\nopen-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application. Our results\ndemonstrate the central role of our RAG approach with ClinicalCorp leveraged\nthrough the MedReAct'N'MedReFlex framework. It achieved the ninth rank on the\nMEDIQA-CORR 2024 final leaderboard.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jean-Philippe Corbeil et.al.", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Corbeil", "id": "2404.15488v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15488v1", "repo": "https://github.com/microsoft/iryonlp-mediqa-corr-2024"}}

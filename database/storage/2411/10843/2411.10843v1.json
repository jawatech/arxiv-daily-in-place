Traditional loss functions in\nmulti-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very\ncommon but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently\nchallenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive\nmodels. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher\nseverity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very\nearly stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we\npropose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of\nfocal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on\nminority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art\nmodels applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good\nperformance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at\n99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and\nInceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes\nenhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical\ndatasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8996\u7db2\u819c\u75c5\u8b8a\u662f\u5168\u7403\u5931\u660e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u6e96\u7684 AI \u8a3a\u65b7\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u591a\u985e\u5225\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u640d\u5931\u51fd\u6578\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5206\u985e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5 (CCE)\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u5e38\u898b\uff0c\u4f46\u6703\u96a8\u8457\u985e\u5225\u5931\u8861\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u985e\u5225\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u6216\u91cd\u758a\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u56b4\u91cd\u5ea6\u8f03\u9ad8\u7684\u7b2c 4 \u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8996\u7db2\u819c\u75c5\u8b8a\u7b49\u985e\u5225\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u6578\u91cf\u56b4\u91cd\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u8207\u7b2c 0 \u671f\u7b49\u975e\u5e38\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u985e\u5225\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9054\u6210\u985e\u5225\u5e73\u8861\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u6df7\u5408\u7126\u9ede\u71b5\u640d\u5931\uff0c\u5b83\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u7126\u9ede\u640d\u5931\u548c\u71b5\u640d\u5931\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e26\u63a1\u7528\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u52a0\u6b0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u4e26\u7a81\u986f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8996\u7db2\u819c\u75c5\u8b8a\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u642d\u914d AHFE\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u793a ResNet50 \u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u70ba 99.79%\u3001DenseNet121 \u70ba 98.86%\u3001Xception \u70ba 98.92%\u3001MobileNetV2 \u70ba 97.84%\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca InceptionV3 \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u70ba 93.62%\u3002\u9019\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 AHFE \u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u9032\u4ee5 AI \u70ba\u4e3b\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\uff0c\u4ee5\u61c9\u5c0d\u8907\u96dc\u4e14\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002", "author": "Pandiyaraju V et.al.", "authors": "Pandiyaraju V, Santhosh Malarvannan, Shravan Venkatraman, Abeshek A, Priyadarshini B, Kannan A", "id": "2411.10843v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10843v1", "repo": "null"}}

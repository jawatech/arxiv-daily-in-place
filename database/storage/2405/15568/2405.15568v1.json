To accomplish this grand vision, learning must occur\nwithin a vast array of potential tasks. Existing approaches to automatically\ngenerating environments are constrained within manually predefined, often\nnarrow distributions of environment, limiting their ability to create any\nlearning environment. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel\nframework, OMNI-EPIC, that augments previous work in Open-endedness via Models\nof human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI) with Environments Programmed in Code\n(EPIC). OMNI-EPIC leverages foundation models to autonomously generate code\nspecifying the next learnable (i.e., not too easy or difficult for the agent's\ncurrent skill set) and interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel) tasks.\nOMNI-EPIC generates both environments (e.g., an obstacle course) and reward\nfunctions (e.g., progress through the obstacle course quickly without touching\nred objects), enabling it, in principle, to create any simulatable learning\ntask. We showcase the explosive creativity of OMNI-EPIC, which continuously\ninnovates to suggest new, interesting learning challenges. We also highlight\nhow OMNI-EPIC can adapt to reinforcement learning agents' learning progress,\ngenerating tasks that are of suitable difficulty. Overall, OMNI-EPIC can\nendlessly create learnable and interesting environments, further propelling the\ndevelopment of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms.

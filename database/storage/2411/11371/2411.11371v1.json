{"2411.11371": {"publish_time": "2024-11-18", "title": "Rethinking Thinking Tokens: Understanding Why They Underperform in Practice", "paper_summary": "Thinking Tokens (TT) have been proposed as an unsupervised method to\nfacilitate reasoning in language models. However, despite their conceptual\nappeal, our findings show that TTs marginally improves performance and\nconsistently underperforms compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning across\nmultiple benchmarks. We hypothesize that this underperformance stems from the\nreliance on a single embedding for TTs, which results in inconsistent learning\nsignals and introduces noisy gradients. This paper provides a comprehensive\nempirical analysis to validate this hypothesis and discusses the implications\nfor future research on unsupervised reasoning in LLMs.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u601d\u8003\u4ee3\u5e63 (TT) \u5df2\u88ab\u63d0\u8b70\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u975e\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u9032\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5176\u6982\u5ff5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u986f\u793a\uff0cTT \u50c5\u5fae\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e2d\u6301\u7e8c\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u5982\u57fa\u65bc\u601d\u8003\u93c8 (CoT) \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u9019\u7a2e\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u4f73\u6e90\u81ea\u65bc\u5c0d TT \u7684\u55ae\u4e00\u5d4c\u5165\u4f9d\u8cf4\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a0a\u865f\u4e26\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u96dc\u8a0a\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7d93\u9a57\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a57\u8b49\u6b64\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u4e26\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5c0d\u672a\u4f86 LLM \u4e2d\u975e\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Sreeram Vennam et.al.", "authors": "Sreeram Vennam, David Valente, David Herel, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru", "id": "2411.11371v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11371v1", "repo": "null"}}

While several methods have been\nproposed to explain embedding-based LP models, they are generally limited to\nlocal explanations on KG and are deficient in providing human interpretable\nsemantics. Based on real-world observations of the characteristics of KGs from\nmultiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with path-based\nexplanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which\nincorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to\nenhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably,\nthe eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation\napproaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across\nbenchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost\nthe quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and\nreduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best\nexisting method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide\nmore semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c (LP) \u5c0d\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u9047\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5df2\u7d93\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7e\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb\u57fa\u65bc\u5d4c\u5165\u7684 LP \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u50c5\u9650\u65bc KG \u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7121\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u3002\u6839\u64da\u4f86\u81ea\u591a\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684 KG \u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u89c0\u5bdf\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u8def\u5f91\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb KG \u4e2d\u7684 LP \u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba eXpath \u7684\u6574\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u95dc\u4fc2\u8def\u5f91\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8207\u672c\u9ad4\u5c01\u9589\u8def\u5f91\u898f\u5247\u76f8\u7d50\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8 LP \u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0ceXpath \u89e3\u91cb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u55ae\u93c8\u8def\u89e3\u91cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8de8\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c LP \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165 eXpath \u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u7d50\u679c\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u63d0\u9ad8\u7d04 20%\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6240\u9700\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u6642\u9593\u6e1b\u5c11 61.4%\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86 eXpath \u901a\u904e\u57fa\u65bc\u8def\u5f91\u7684\u8b49\u64da\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u8a9e\u7fa9\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "author": "Ye Sun et.al.", "authors": "Ye Sun, Lei Shi, Yongxin Tong", "id": "2412.04846v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04846v1", "repo": "null"}}

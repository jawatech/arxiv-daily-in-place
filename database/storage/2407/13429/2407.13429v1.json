Better acquisition policies can\nreduce costs while maintaining or even improving the performance of downstream\npredictors. Inspired by the maximization of conditional mutual information, we\npropose an approach to train acquirers end-to-end using only the downstream\nloss. We show that our method outperforms random acquisition policy, matches a\nmodel with an unrestrained budget, but does not yet overtake a static\nacquisition strategy. We highlight the assumptions and outline avenues for\nfuture work.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e86\u89e3\u591a\u8b8a\u91cf\u6642\u9593\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5fb5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u6642\u6e2c\u91cf\u662f\u91ab\u5b78\u3001\u7a7f\u6234\u88dd\u7f6e\u548c\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u8853\u4e2d\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7372\u53d6\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u7dad\u6301\u6216\u751a\u81f3\u6539\u5584\u4e0b\u6e38\u9810\u6e2c\u5668\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u689d\u4ef6\u4e92\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u50c5\u4e0b\u6e38\u640d\u5931\uff0c\u5f9e\u982d\u5230\u5c3e\u8a13\u7df4\u7372\u53d6\u5668\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u96a8\u6a5f\u7372\u53d6\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u9810\u7b97\u4e0d\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u975c\u614b\u7372\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f37\u8abf\u5047\u8a2d\u4e26\u6982\u8ff0\u672a\u4f86\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u9014\u5f91\u3002", "author": "Fedor Sergeev et.al.", "authors": "Fedor Sergeev, Paola Malsot, Gunnar R\u00e4tsch, Vincent Fortuin", "id": "2407.13429v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13429v1", "repo": "null"}}

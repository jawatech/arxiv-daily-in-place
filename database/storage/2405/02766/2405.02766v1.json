A salient feature of the brain that allows\neffective CL is that it utilizes multiple modalities for learning and\ninference, which is underexplored in DNNs. Therefore, we study the role and\ninteractions of multiple modalities in mitigating forgetting and introduce a\nbenchmark for multimodal continual learning. Our findings demonstrate that\nleveraging multiple views and complementary information from multiple\nmodalities enables the model to learn more accurate and robust representations.\nThis makes the model less vulnerable to modality-specific regularities and\nconsiderably mitigates forgetting. Furthermore, we observe that individual\nmodalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness to distribution shift.\nFinally, we propose a method for integrating and aligning the information from\ndifferent modalities by utilizing the relational structural similarities\nbetween the data points in each modality. Our method sets a strong baseline\nthat enables both single- and multimodal inference. Our study provides a\npromising case for further exploring the role of multiple modalities in\nenabling CL and provides a standard benchmark for future research.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Fahad Sarfraz et.al.", "authors": "Fahad Sarfraz,Bahram Zonooz,Elahe Arani", "id": "2405.02766v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02766v1", "repo": "null"}}

Over the last few years, numerous optimization\ntechniques have been developed that are inspired by natural phenomena.\nRecently, the propagation of the new COVID-19 implied a burden on the public\nhealth system to suffer several deaths. Vaccination, masks, and social\ndistancing are the major steps taken to minimize the spread of the deadly\nCOVID-19 virus. Considering the social distance to combat the coronavirus\nepidemic, a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization model is proposed in\nthis work, and it is termed as Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus\nOptimization Algorithm (COVO). The pace of propagation of the coronavirus can\nindeed be slowed by maintaining social distance. Thirteen benchmark functions\nare used to evaluate the COVO performance for discrete, continuous, and complex\nproblems, and the COVO model performance is compared with other well-known\noptimization algorithms. The main motive of COVO optimization is to obtain a\nglobal solution to various applications by solving complex problems with faster\nconvergence. At last, the validated results depict that the proposed COVO\noptimization has a reasonable and acceptable performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u53d7\u81ea\u7136\u73b0\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed9\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6c89\u91cd\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u3001\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u793e\u4ea4\u8ddd\u79bb\u662f\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u800c\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4fdd\u6301\u793e\u4ea4\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79f0\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5 (COVO)\u3002\u4fdd\u6301\u793e\u4ea4\u8ddd\u79bb\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u7f13\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5341\u4e09\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 COVO \u5728\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06 COVO \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002COVO \u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 COVO \u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Om Ramakisan Varma et.al.", "authors": "Om Ramakisan Varma, Mala Kalra", "id": "2411.17282v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17282v1", "repo": "null"}}

A brief history of text summarization from the 1950s\nto the introduction of pre-trained language models such as Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) and Generative Pre-training\nTransformers (GPT) are presented. In total, 60 studies were identified in\nPubMed and Web of Science, of which 29 were excluded and 24 were read and\nevaluated for eligibility, resulting in the use of seven studies for further\nanalysis. This chapter also includes a section with examples including an\nexample of a comparison between GPT-3 and state-of-the-art GPT-4 solutions in\nscientific text summarisation. Natural language processing has not yet reached\nits full potential in the generation of brief textual summaries. As there are\nacknowledged concerns that must be addressed, we can expect gradual\nintroduction of such models in practise.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7bc7\u8a55\u8ad6\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u5f0f\u57fa\u65bc\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u64f7\u53d6\u5f0f\u6458\u8981\u6280\u8853\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u7c21\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f9e 1950 \u5e74\u4ee3\u5230\u5f15\u5165\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u597d\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4f86\u81ea Transformer \u7684\u96d9\u5411\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u8868\u5fb5 (BERT) \u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9810\u8a13\u7df4 Transformer (GPT)\uff09\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u6458\u8981\u6b77\u53f2\u3002\u7e3d\u5171\u5728 PubMed \u548c Web of Science \u4e2d\u627e\u51fa 60 \u9805\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d 29 \u9805\u88ab\u6392\u9664\uff0c24 \u9805\u88ab\u95b1\u8b80\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u8cc7\u683c\uff0c\u6700\u5f8c\u4f7f\u7528 7 \u9805\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u884c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7ae0\u9084\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u500b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5340\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b GPT-3 \u548c\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 GPT-4 \u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u79d1\u5b78\u6587\u5b57\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u5728\u7522\u751f\u7c21\u6f54\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u767c\u63ee\u5176\u5168\u90e8\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5b58\u5728\u516c\u8a8d\u7684\u7591\u616e\u5fc5\u9808\u89e3\u6c7a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u9810\u671f\u5728\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\u9010\u6f38\u5c0e\u5165\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Leon Kopitar et.al.", "authors": "Leon Kopitar, Primoz Kocbek, Lucija Gosak, Gregor Stiglic", "id": "2411.11635v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11635v1", "repo": "null"}}

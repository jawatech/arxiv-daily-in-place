Multiple surveys have\nbeen published on this topic, providing the community with comprehensive\naccounts of the research in this area. Among all mental health conditions,\ndepression is the most widely studied due to its worldwide prevalence. The\nCOVID-19 global pandemic, starting in early 2020, has had a great impact on\nmental health worldwide. Harsh measures employed by governments to slow the\nspread of the virus (e.g., lockdowns) and the subsequent economic downturn\nexperienced in many countries have significantly impacted people's lives and\nmental health. Studies have shown a substantial increase of above 50% in the\nrate of depression in the population. In this context, we present a survey on\nnatural language processing (NLP) approaches to modeling depression in social\nmedia, providing the reader with a post-COVID-19 outlook. This survey\ncontributes to the understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on modeling\ndepression in social media. We outline how state-of-the-art approaches and new\ndatasets have been used in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we\nalso discuss ethical issues in collecting and processing mental health data,\nconsidering fairness, accountability, and ethics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u8a08\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u9810\u6e2c\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u3002\u95dc\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u4e3b\u984c\u5df2\u7d93\u767c\u8868\u4e86\u591a\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u70ba\u793e\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8aaa\u660e\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u800c\u6210\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u591a\u7684\u30022020\u5e74\u521d\u958b\u59cb\u7684COVID-19\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5c0d\u5168\u7403\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7522\u751f\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u653f\u5e9c\u70ba\u6e1b\u7de9\u75c5\u6bd2\u50b3\u64ad\u800c\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u56b4\u53b2\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5c01\u9396\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8a31\u591a\u570b\u5bb6\u96a8\u5f8c\u7d93\u6b77\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u8870\u9000\u5c0d\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7522\u751f\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u53e3\u4e2d\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u7684\u767c\u751f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u8d85\u904e50%\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u9032\u884c\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba\u8b80\u8005\u63d0\u4f9bCOVID-19\u5f8c\u7684\u5c55\u671b\u3002\u9019\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u4e86\u89e3\u75ab\u60c5\u5c0d\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u5728COVID-19\u75ab\u60c5\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u5728\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8655\u7406\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8cc7\u6599\u6642\u8003\u616e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8cac\u4efb\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u502b\u7406\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Ana-Maria Bucur et.al.", "authors": "Ana-Maria Bucur, Andreea-Codrina Moldovan, Krutika Parvatikar, Marcos Zampieri, Ashiqur R.

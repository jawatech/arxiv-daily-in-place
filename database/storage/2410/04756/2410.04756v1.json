{"2410.04756": {"publish_time": "2024-10-07", "title": "Item Cluster-aware Prompt Learning for Session-based Recommendation", "paper_summary": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to capture dynamic user preferences\nby analyzing item sequences within individual sessions. However, most existing\napproaches focus mainly on intra-session item relationships, neglecting the\nconnections between items across different sessions (inter-session\nrelationships), which limits their ability to fully capture complex item\ninteractions. While some methods incorporate inter-session information, they\noften suffer from high computational costs, leading to longer training times\nand reduced efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the CLIP-SBR\n(Cluster-aware Item Prompt learning for Session-Based Recommendation)\nframework. CLIP-SBR is composed of two modules: 1) an item relationship mining\nmodule that builds a global graph to effectively model both intra- and\ninter-session relationships, and 2) an item cluster-aware prompt learning\nmodule that uses soft prompts to integrate these relationships into SBR models\nefficiently. We evaluate CLIP-SBR across eight SBR models and three benchmark\ndatasets, consistently demonstrating improved recommendation performance and\nestablishing CLIP-SBR as a robust solution for session-based recommendation\ntasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u57fa\u65bc\u6703\u8a71\u7684\u63a8\u85a6 (SBR) \u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u900f\u904e\u5206\u6790\u500b\u5225\u6703\u8a71\u4e2d\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u5e8f\u5217\u4f86\u6355\u6349\u52d5\u614b\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u504f\u597d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u6703\u8a71\u5167\u9805\u76ee\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u6703\u8a71\u4e4b\u9593\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u95dc\u806f (\u6703\u8a71\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2)\uff0c\u9019\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u8907\u96dc\u9805\u76ee\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u6709\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d0d\u5165\u4e86\u6703\u8a71\u9593\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u7d93\u5e38\u6703\u7522\u751f\u9ad8\u904b\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u66f4\u9577\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CLIP-SBR (\u57fa\u65bc\u6703\u8a71\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u7684\u7fa4\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u9805\u76ee\u63d0\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2) \u67b6\u69cb\u3002CLIP-SBR \u7531\u5169\u500b\u6a21\u7d44\u7d44\u6210\uff1a1) \u9805\u76ee\u95dc\u4fc2\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u57df\u5716\u5f62\u4f86\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u6703\u8a71\u5167\u548c\u6703\u8a71\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 2) \u9805\u76ee\u7fa4\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8edf\u63d0\u793a\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u95dc\u4fc2\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5230 SBR \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u516b\u500b SBR \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u8a55\u4f30 CLIP-SBR\uff0c\u6301\u7e8c\u5c55\u73fe\u6539\u5584\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e26\u78ba\u7acb CLIP-SBR \u70ba\u57fa\u65bc\u6703\u8a71\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "author": "Wooseong Yang et.al.", "authors": "Wooseong Yang, Chen Wang, Zihe Song, Weizhi Zhang, Philip S.

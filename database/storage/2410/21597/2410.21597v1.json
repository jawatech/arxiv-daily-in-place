As these models are intended for\nparticular purposes, they should not be able to answer irrelevant queries like\nrequests for poetry or questions about physics, or even worse, queries that can\nonly be answered by humans like sensitive company policies. Instead we would\nlike them to only answer queries corresponding to desired behavior and refuse\nall other requests, which we refer to as scoping. We find that, despite the use\nof system prompts, two representative language models can be poorly scoped and\nrespond to queries they should not be addressing. We then conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical evaluation of methods which could be used for scoping\nthe behavior of language models. Among many other results, we show that a\nrecently-proposed method for general alignment, Circuit Breakers (CB), can be\nadapted to scope language models to very specific tasks like sentiment analysis\nor summarization or even tasks with finer-grained scoping (e.g. summarizing\nonly news articles). When compared to standard methods like fine-tuning or\npreference learning, CB is more robust both for out of distribution tasks, and\nto adversarial prompting techniques. We also show that layering SFT and CB\ntogether often results in the best of both worlds: improved performance only on\nrelevant queries, while rejecting irrelevant ones.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u73fe\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u9762\u5411\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u65bc\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u56de\u7b54\u6587\u4ef6\u554f\u984c\u6216\u64d4\u4efb\u7de8\u78bc\u52a9\u7406\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5c08\u70ba\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u9014\u800c\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0d\u61c9\u80fd\u5920\u56de\u7b54\u8207\u5176\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8a69\u6b4c\u8acb\u6c42\u6216\u7269\u7406\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u7cdf\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4eba\u985e\u624d\u80fd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u654f\u611f\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u5b83\u5011\u53ea\u56de\u7b54\u8207\u6240\u9700\u884c\u70ba\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\uff0c\u4e26\u62d2\u7d55\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u8acb\u6c42\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u7bc4\u570d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7cfb\u7d71\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5169\u500b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7bc4\u570d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5dee\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6703\u56de\u61c9\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u61c9\u8655\u7406\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u754c\u5b9a\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5be6\u8b49\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u7d50\u679c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5c0d\u9f4a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96fb\u8def\u4e2d\u65b7\u5668 (CB)\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9069\u61c9\u7bc4\u570d\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u9ad4\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\u6216\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u7bc4\u570d\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u50c5\u6458\u8981\u65b0\u805e\u6587\u7ae0\uff09\u3002\u8207\u5fae\u8abf\u6216\u504f\u597d\u5b78\u7fd2\u7b49\u6a19\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCB \u5c0d\u5206\u4f48\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u5c0d\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u8853\u90fd\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c07 SFT \u548c CB \u5206\u5c64\u7d50\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u7522\u751f\u5169\u5168\u5176\u7f8e\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1a\u50c5\u5728\u76f8\u95dc\u67e5\u8a62\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u62d2\u7d55\u4e0d\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\u3002", "author": "David Yunis et.al.", "authors": "David Yunis, Siyu Huo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Danish Contractor", "id": "2410.21597v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21597v1", "repo": "null"}}

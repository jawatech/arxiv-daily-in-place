However, as pointed out by recent studies, existing related\nmethods tend to merely memorize the superficial word composition of the edited\nknowledge, rather than truly learning and absorbing it. Consequently, on the\nreasoning questions, we discover that existing methods struggle to utilize the\nedited knowledge to reason the new answer, and tend to retain outdated\nresponses, which are generated by the original models utilizing original\nknowledge. Nevertheless, the outdated responses are unexpected for the correct\nanswers to reasoning questions, which we named as the outdated issue. To\nalleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective decoding\nstrategy, i.e., outDated ISsue aware deCOding (DISCO), to enhance the\nperformance of edited models on reasoning questions. Specifically, we capture\nthe difference in the probability distribution between the original and edited\nmodels. Further, we amplify the difference of the token prediction in the\nedited model to alleviate the outdated issue, and thus enhance the model\nperformance w.r.t the edited knowledge. Experimental results suggest that\napplying DISCO could enhance edited models to reason, e.g., on reasoning\nquestions, DISCO outperforms the prior SOTA method by 12.99 F1 scores, and\nreduces the ratio of the outdated issue to 5.78% on the zsRE dataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u8fd1\u671f\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u53d7\u5230\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8bb0\u4f4f\u5df2\u7f16\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8bcd\u8bed\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5438\u6536\u5b83\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u65b0\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u7531\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u610f\u5916\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5373\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801 (DISCO)\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6355\u6349\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f16\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528 DISCO \u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cDISCO \u5728 zsRE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5 12.99 F1 \u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684 SOTA \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u5230 5.78%\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Zengkui Sun et.al.", "authors": "Zengkui Sun, Yijin Liu, Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Jinan Xu, Yufeng Chen, Jie Zhou", "id": "2406.02882v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02882v2", "repo": "null"}}

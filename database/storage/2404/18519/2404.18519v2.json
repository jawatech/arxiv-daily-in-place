One of those domains is healthcare, where groups of silos\ncollaborate in order to generate a global predictor with improved accuracy and\ngeneralization. However, the inherent challenge lies in the high heterogeneity\nof medical data, necessitating sophisticated techniques for assessment and\ncompensation. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the\nmathematical formalization and taxonomy of heterogeneity within FL\nenvironments, focusing on the intricacies of medical data. In particular, we\naddress the evaluation and comparison of the most popular FL algorithms with\nrespect to their ability to cope with quantity-based, feature and label\ndistribution-based heterogeneity. The goal is to provide a quantitative\nevaluation of the impact of data heterogeneity in FL systems for healthcare\nnetworks as well as a guideline on FL algorithm selection. Our research extends\nbeyond existing studies by benchmarking seven of the most common FL algorithms\nagainst the unique challenges posed by medical data use cases. The paper\ntargets the prediction of the risk of stroke recurrence through a set of\ntabular clinical reports collected by different federated hospital silos: data\nheterogeneity frequently encountered in this scenario and its impact on FL\nperformance are discussed.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Usevalad Milasheuski.

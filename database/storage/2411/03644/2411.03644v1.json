Traditional approaches\noften tackle each task separately by its own network, which leads to excessive\ncosts for developing and scaling models, especially in the context of large\nlanguage models. Although multi-task methods can save costs through parameter\nsharing, they often struggle to outperform single-task methods in real-world\napplications. To tackle these challenges, we present a three-stage multi-task\nlearning framework for large language models. It involves task filtering,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on high-resource tasks, and finally fine-tuning on all\ntasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments in single-task and multi-task\nsettings. Our approach, exemplified on different benchmarks, demonstrates that\nit is able to achieve performance comparable to the single-task method while\nreducing up to 90.9\\% of its overhead.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u7522\u696d\u4e2d\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u662f\u5728\u7dda\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u3002\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u5176\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u5206\u5225\u8655\u7406\u6bcf\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9019\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u958b\u767c\u548c\u64f4\u5145\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u904e\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u53c3\u6578\u5171\u4eab\u4f86\u7bc0\u7701\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u96e3\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u968e\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u5b78\u7fd2\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u52d9\u7be9\u9078\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u5728\u9ad8\u8cc7\u6e90\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u6700\u5f8c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u70ba\u4f8b\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u5b83\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u6e1b\u5c11\u9ad8\u9054 90.9% \u7684\u958b\u92b7\u4e0b\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u8207\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7576\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Yincen Qu et.al.", "authors": "Yincen Qu, Chao Ma, Yiting Wu, Xiangying Dai, Hui Zhou, Hengyue Liu", "id": "2411.03644v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03644v1", "repo": "null"}}

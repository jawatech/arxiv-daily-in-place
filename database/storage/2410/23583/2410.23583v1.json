Contrastive learning methods can reduce this anisotropy\nphenomena, and also help to avoid class collapse in any classification problem.\nIn the present paper, a new training method called biological non-contrastive\nrelation extraction (BioNCERE) is introduced for relation extraction without\nusing any named entity labels for training to reduce annotation costs. BioNCERE\nuses transfer learning and non-contrastive learning to avoid full or\ndimensional collapse as well as bypass overfitting. It resolves RE in three\nstages by leveraging transfer learning two times. By freezing the weights\nlearned in previous stages in the proposed pipeline and by leveraging\nnon-contrastive learning in the second stage, the model predicts relations\nwithout any knowledge of named entities. Experiments have been done on SemMedDB\nthat are almost similar to State-of-the-art performance on RE without using the\ninformation of named entities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u8403\u53d6 (RE) \u6700\u5148\u9032\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u616e\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u985e\u5fae\u8abf BioBERT\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u906d\u53d7\u5404\u5411\u7570\u6027\u554f\u984c\u7684\u56f0\u64fe\u3002\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e1b\u5c11\u6b64\u5404\u5411\u7570\u6027\u73fe\u8c61\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u4f55\u5206\u985e\u554f\u984c\u4e2d\u7684\u985e\u5225\u5d29\u6f70\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u751f\u7269\u975e\u5c0d\u6bd4\u95dc\u4fc2\u8403\u53d6 (BioNCERE) \u7684\u65b0\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u95dc\u4fc2\u8403\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u547d\u540d\u5be6\u9ad4\u6a19\u7c64\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8a3b\u89e3\u6210\u672c\u3002BioNCERE \u4f7f\u7528\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u975e\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u6216\u7dad\u5ea6\u5d29\u6f70\uff0c\u4e26\u7e5e\u904e\u904e\u5ea6\u64ec\u5408\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u904e\u5169\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a RE \u7684\u4e09\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u901a\u904e\u51cd\u7d50\u5728\u63d0\u8b70\u7ba1\u7dda\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u968e\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6b0a\u91cd\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u968e\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c92\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u547d\u540d\u5be6\u9ad4\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u9810\u6e2c\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u5df2\u5728 SemMedDB \u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5176\u8207\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u547d\u540d\u5be6\u9ad4\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684 RE \u6700\u5148\u9032\u6548\u80fd\u5e7e\u4e4e\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "author": "Farshad Noravesh et.al.", "authors": "Farshad Noravesh", "id": "2410.23583v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23583v1", "repo": "null"}}

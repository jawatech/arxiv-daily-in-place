They provide insights into ancient religions, ceremonies, folklore,\namong other things through their content. However, due to long-term oxidation\nand inadequate protection, ancient murals have suffered continuous damage,\nincluding peeling and mold etc. Additionally, since ancient murals were\ntypically painted indoors, the light intensity in images captured by digital\ndevices is often low. The poor visibility hampers the further restoration of\ndamaged areas. To address the escalating damage to ancient frescoes and\nfacilitate batch restoration at archaeological sites, we propose a two-stage\nrestoration model which called MER(Mural Enhancement and Restoration net) for\nancient murals that are damaged and have been captured in low light. Our\ntwo-stage model not only enhances the visual quality of restored images but\nalso achieves commendable results in relevant metric evaluations compared with\nother competitors. Furthermore, we have launched a website dedicated to the\nrestoration of ancient mural paintings, utilizing the proposed model.

The data\nare first analyzed by descriptive statistics, and then the model is built and\ntrained and tested on the dataset. After optimization and adjustment, the mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of the model gradually decreases from 0.11 to 0.01 and\ntends to be stable, indicating that the model prediction effect is gradually\nclose to the real value. The results on the test set show that the time series\nalgorithm optimized based on Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Long Short-Term Memory\nNetwork (LSTM) is able to accurately predict the stock prices, and is highly\nconsistent with the actual price trends and values, with strong generalization\nability. The MAE on the test set is 2.41, the MSE is 9.84, the RMSE is 3.13,\nand the R2 is 0.87. This research result not only provides a novel stock price\nprediction method, but also provides a useful reference for financial market\nanalysis using computer technology and big data.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Xinye Sha et.al.", "authors": "Xinye Sha", "id": "2405.03151v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03151v1", "repo": "null"}}

Using\na one-way between-subjects design, the research involved 478 online\nparticipants who were presented with guidelines for either trustworthy or\nreliable AI. Participants then evaluated three vignette scenarios and completed\na modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model, which included variables\nsuch as perceived ease of use, human-like trust, and overall attitude. Although\nlabeling AI as \"trustworthy\" did not significantly influence judgments on\nspecific scenarios, it increased perceived ease of use and human-like trust,\nparticularly benevolence. This suggests a positive impact on usability and an\nanthropomorphic effect on user perceptions. The study provides insights into\nhow specific labels can influence attitudes toward AI technology.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a19\u7c64 AI \u70ba\u300c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8cf4\u300d\u6216\u300c\u53ef\u9760\u300d\u662f\u5426\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5c0d\u6c7d\u8eca AI \u6280\u8853\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a1\u7528\u55ae\u5411\u53d7\u8a66\u8005\u9593\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u53c3\u8207\u7814\u7a76\u7684 478 \u4f4d\u7dda\u4e0a\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u6703\u6536\u5230\u53ef\u4fe1\u8cf4\u6216\u53ef\u9760 AI \u7684\u6307\u5f15\u3002\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u63a5\u8457\u8a55\u4f30\u4e09\u500b\u77ed\u6587\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4e26\u5b8c\u6210\u6539\u826f\u7248\u7684\u6280\u8853\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3001\u985e\u4eba\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6574\u9ad4\u614b\u5ea6\u7b49\u8b8a\u6578\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u6a19\u7c64 AI \u70ba\u300c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8cf4\u300d\u4e26\u672a\u986f\u8457\u5f71\u97ff\u5c0d\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u5224\u65b7\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u985e\u4eba\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u4ec1\u6148\u3002\u9019\u8868\u793a\u5c0d\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8a8d\u77e5\u7522\u751f\u64ec\u4eba\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u5165\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a19\u7c64\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u5c0d AI \u6280\u8853\u7684\u614b\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "John Dorsch et.al.", "authors": "John Dorsch, Ophelia Deroy", "id": "2408.10905v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10905v1", "repo": "null"}}

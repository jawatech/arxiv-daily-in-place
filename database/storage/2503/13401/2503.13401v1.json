Recognizing\nthis problem as analogous to the historical difficulties in understanding the\nhuman mind, we argue that methods developed in cognitive science can be useful\nfor understanding large language models. We propose a framework for applying\nthese methods based on Marr's three levels of analysis. By revisiting\nestablished cognitive science techniques relevant to each level and\nillustrating their potential to yield insights into the behavior and internal\norganization of large language models, we aim to provide a toolkit for making\nsense of these new kinds of minds.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5f37\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u96e3\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8a8d\u8b58\u5230\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u8207\u6b77\u53f2\u4e0a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u985e\u601d\u7dad\u7684\u56f0\u96e3\u985e\u4f3c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u8a8d\u77e5\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7528\u65bc\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u57fa\u65bc\u99ac\u723e\u7684\u4e09\u500b\u5206\u6790\u5c64\u7d1a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u61c9\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u904e\u91cd\u65b0\u5be9\u8996\u8207\u6bcf\u500b\u5c64\u7d1a\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u65e2\u6709\u8a8d\u77e5\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4e26\u8aaa\u660e\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u5167\u90e8\u7d44\u7e54\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u500b\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7406\u89e3\u9019\u4e9b\u65b0\u578b\u614b\u7684\u601d\u7dad\u3002\n", "author": "Alexander Ku et.al.", "authors": "Alexander Ku, Declan Campbell, Xuechunzi Bai, Jiayi Geng, Ryan Liu, Raja Marjieh, R.

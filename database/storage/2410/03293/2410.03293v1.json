This dataset,\navailable at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in\n161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the\ndevelopment of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed,\nwhich involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The\nresults of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this\ndataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per\nyear from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related\nto COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance,\nbetween 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive\nsentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from\n44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of\nlanguage-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and\ncontrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages\non Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive,\n14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts,\n4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting\ndistinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u958b\u63a1\u548c\u5206\u6790 Instagram \u4e0a\u8207 COVID-19 \u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u8cbc\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u9805\u79d1\u5b78\u8ca2\u737b\u3002\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b 2020 \u5e74 1 \u6708\u81f3 2024 \u5e74 9 \u6708\u9593\u767c\u5e03\u7684 500,153 \u7bc7\u95dc\u65bc COVID-19 \u7684 Instagram \u8cbc\u6587\u3002\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u53ef\u65bc https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480 \u53d6\u5f97\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b 161 \u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684 Instagram \u8cbc\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 535,021 \u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\u3002\u5728\u958b\u767c\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5f8c\uff0c\u57f7\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u5c07\u6bcf\u5247\u8cbc\u6587\u5206\u985e\u70ba\u6b63\u9762\u3001\u8ca0\u9762\u6216\u4e2d\u7acb\u3002\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u7368\u7acb\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\u5448\u73fe\u65bc\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f9e 2020 \u5e74\u5230 2024 \u5e74\u6bcf\u5e74\u57f7\u884c\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u63ed\u9732\u4e86\u81ea\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u767c\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0cInstagram \u4e0a\u8207 COVID-19 \u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u8da8\u52e2\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728 2020 \u5e74\u81f3 2024 \u5e74\u9593\uff0c\u60c5\u7dd2\u8da8\u52e2\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u6b63\u9762\u60c5\u7dd2\u5f9e 38.35% \u4e0b\u964d\u81f3 28.69%\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u7acb\u60c5\u7dd2\u5f9e 44.19% \u4e0a\u5347\u81f3 58.34%\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u8a9e\u8a00\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u3002\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u5728 Instagram \u4e0a\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u767c\u5e03\u7684\u8cbc\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u7dd2\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u5c0d\u6bd4\u8da8\u52e2\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u82f1\u6587\u8cbc\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c49.68% \u70ba\u6b63\u9762\uff0c14.84% \u70ba\u8ca0\u9762\uff0c35.48% \u70ba\u4e2d\u7acb\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5370\u5730\u8a9e\u8cbc\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c4.40% \u70ba\u6b63\u9762\uff0c57.04% \u70ba\u8ca0\u9762\uff0c38.56% \u70ba\u4e2d\u7acb\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u5728\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u4f48\u4e0a\u7684\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u7570\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Nirmalya Thakur et.al.", "authors": "Nirmalya Thakur", "id": "2410.03293v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03293v1", "repo": "null"}}

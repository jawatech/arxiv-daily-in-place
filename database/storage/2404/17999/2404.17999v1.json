This paper\npresents a novel approach submitted to the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task (Ben\nAbacha et al., 2024a), focusing on the automatic correction of single-word\nerrors in clinical notes. Unlike LLMs that rely on extensive generic data, our\nmethod emphasizes extracting contextually relevant information from available\nclinical text data. Leveraging an ensemble of extractive and abstractive\nquestion-answering approaches, we construct a supervised learning framework\nwith domain-specific feature engineering. Our methodology incorporates domain\nexpertise to enhance error correction accuracy. By integrating domain expertise\nand prioritizing meaningful information extraction, our approach underscores\nthe significance of a human-centric strategy in adapting AI for healthcare.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Nadia Saeed et.al.", "authors": "Nadia Saeed", "id": "2404.17999v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17999v1", "repo": "https://github.com/nadiasaeed/medifact-mediqa-corr-2024"}}

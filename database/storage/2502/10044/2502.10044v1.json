{"2502.10044": {"publish_time": "2025-02-14", "title": "Unsupervised Entity Alignment Based on Personalized Discriminative Rooted Tree", "paper_summary": "Entity Alignment (EA) is to link potential equivalent entities across\ndifferent knowledge graphs (KGs). Most existing EA methods are supervised as\nthey require the supervision of seed alignments, i.e., manually specified\naligned entity pairs. Very recently, several EA studies have made some attempts\nto get rid of seed alignments. Despite achieving preliminary progress, they\nstill suffer two limitations: (1) The entity embeddings produced by their\nGNN-like encoders lack personalization since some of the aggregation subpaths\nare shared between different entities. (2) They cannot fully alleviate the\ndistribution distortion issue between candidate KGs due to the absence of the\nsupervised signal. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised entity\nalignment approach called UNEA to address the above two issues. First, we\nparametrically sample a tree neighborhood rooted at each entity, and\naccordingly develop a tree attention aggregation mechanism to extract a\npersonalized embedding for each entity. Second, we introduce an auxiliary task\nof maximizing the mutual information between the input and the output of the KG\nencoder, to regularize the model and prevent the distribution distortion.\nExtensive experiments show that our UNEA achieves a new state-of-the-art for\nthe unsupervised EA task, and can even outperform many existing supervised EA\nbaselines.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5be6\u9ad4\u5c0d\u9f4a (EA) \u662f\u5c07\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7b49\u6548\u5be6\u9ad4\u9023\u7d50\u8d77\u4f86\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6578\u73fe\u6709\u7684 EA \u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u9700\u8981\u7a2e\u5b50\u5c0d\u9f4a\u7684\u76e3\u7763\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u624b\u52d5\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5c0d\u9f4a\u5be6\u9ad4\u914d\u5c0d\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e7e\u9805 EA \u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u5617\u8a66\u64fa\u812b\u7a2e\u5b50\u5c0d\u9f4a\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u53d6\u5f97\u521d\u6b65\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4ecd\u6709\u5169\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5b83\u5011\u7684 GNN \u985e\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u5d4c\u5165\u7f3a\u4e4f\u500b\u4eba\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u67d0\u4e9b\u805a\u5408\u5b50\u8def\u5f91\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5be6\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u5171\u4eab\u3002(2) \u7531\u65bc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76e3\u7763\u8a0a\u865f\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7de9\u89e3\u5019\u9078 KG \u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5206\u914d\u5931\u771f\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba UNEA \u7684\u65b0\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u5be6\u9ad4\u5c0d\u9f4a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5169\u500b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53c3\u6578\u5316\u5730\u5c0d\u6839\u690d\u65bc\u6bcf\u500b\u5be6\u9ad4\u7684\u6a39\u72c0\u9130\u57df\u9032\u884c\u62bd\u6a23\uff0c\u4e26\u64da\u6b64\u958b\u767c\u4e00\u500b\u6a39\u72c0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u70ba\u6bcf\u500b\u5be6\u9ad4\u63d0\u53d6\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u8f14\u52a9\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5c07 KG \u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u548c\u8f38\u51fa\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u898f\u7bc4\u6a21\u578b\u4e26\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u914d\u5931\u771f\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684 UNEA \u70ba\u7121\u76e3\u7763 EA \u4efb\u52d9\u5be6\u73fe\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u8853\u6c34\u6e96\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u8a31\u591a\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f EA \u57fa\u6e96\u3002", "author": "Yaming Yang et.al.", "authors": "Yaming Yang, Zhe Wang, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Xinyan Huang, Xiaofei He", "id": "2502.10044v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10044v1", "repo": "null"}}

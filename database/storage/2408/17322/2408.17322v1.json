Though there are\nmany interpretability methods, many look at models through their neuronal\nactivations, which are poorly understood. We describe different lenses through\nwhich to view neuron activations, and investigate the effectiveness in language\nmodels and vision transformers through various methods of neural ablation: zero\nablation, mean ablation, activation resampling, and a novel approach we term\n'peak ablation'. Through experimental analysis, we find that in different\nregimes and models, each method can offer the lowest degradation of model\nperformance compared to other methods, with resampling usually causing the most\nsignificant performance deterioration. We make our code available at\nhttps://github.com/nickypro/investigating-ablation.", "paper_summary_zh": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u6574\u500b\u793e\u6703\u4e2d\u6b63\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u9577\u3002\n\u96a8\u8457\u9019\u7a2e\u589e\u9577\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u904b\u4f5c\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u6a5f\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8a31\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u900f\u904e\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u6d3b\u5316\u4f86\u67e5\u770b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u65b9\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u93e1\u982d\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u9019\u4e9b\u93e1\u982d\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u6d3b\u5316\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u5404\u7a2e\u795e\u7d93\u6d88\u878d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u8a0e\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8996\u89baTransformer\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u96f6\u6d88\u878d\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u6d88\u878d\u3001\u6d3b\u5316\u518d\u62bd\u6a23\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u300c\u5cf0\u503c\u6d88\u878d\u300d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u9a57\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u518d\u62bd\u6a23\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u9020\u6210\u6700\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u60e1\u5316\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 https://github.com/nickypro/investigating-ablation \u63d0\u4f9b\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u3002", "author": "Nicholas Pochinkov et.al.", "authors": "Nicholas Pochinkov, Ben Pasero, Skylar Shibayama", "id": "2408.17322v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17322v1", "repo": "https://github.com/nickypro/investigating-ablation"}}

This study uses causal\ninference methods, employing data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) to examine this relationship across diverse\ndemographics. Instead of relying on RCT data, we constructed a causal graph and\napplied the back-door criterion with its adjustment formula to estimate the RCT\ndistributions. We then calculated the counterfactual quantity, the Probability\nof Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS), using both NHANES data and estimated RCT\ndata. We propose that PNS is the essential metric for assessing the impact of\nDiet Coke on obesity. Our results indicate that between 20% to 50% of\nindividuals, especially those with poor dietary habits, are more likely to gain\nweight from Diet Coke. Conversely, in groups like young females with healthier\ndiets, only a small proportion experience weight gain due to Diet Coke. These\nfindings highlight the influence of individual lifestyle and potential hormonal\nfactors on the varied effects of Diet Coke, providing a new framework for\nunderstanding its nutritional impacts on health.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u52a0\u7cd6\u98f2\u6599\uff08\u5982\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u9078\u64c7\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0d\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u80a5\u80d6\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u722d\u8ad6\u4ecd\u6301\u7e8c\u8457\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u89c0\u5bdf\u6578\u64da\u6216\u96a8\u6a5f\u5c0d\u7167\u8a66\u9a57 (RCT)\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u7121\u6cd5\u6e96\u78ba\u6355\u6349\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\u651d\u53d6\u8207\u80a5\u80d6\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u8ad6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u570b\u5bb6\u5065\u5eb7\u8207\u71df\u990a\u6aa2\u67e5\u8abf\u67e5 (NHANES) \u7684\u6578\u64da\u4f86\u6aa2\u9a57\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7d71\u8a08\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u9019\u7a2e\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6c92\u6709\u4f9d\u8cf4 RCT \u6578\u64da\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5efa\u69cb\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u56e0\u679c\u5716\uff0c\u4e26\u61c9\u7528\u5f8c\u9580\u6e96\u5247\u53ca\u5176\u8abf\u6574\u516c\u5f0f\u4f86\u4f30\u8a08 RCT \u5206\u914d\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528 NHANES \u6578\u64da\u548c\u4f30\u8a08\u7684 RCT \u6578\u64da\u8a08\u7b97\u53cd\u4e8b\u5be6\u6578\u91cf\uff0c\u5373\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6a5f\u7387 (PNS)\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa PNS \u662f\u8a55\u4f30\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\u5c0d\u80a5\u80d6\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c20% \u81f3 50% \u7684\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u98f2\u98df\u7fd2\u6163\u4e0d\u826f\u8005\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u9ad4\u91cd\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0c\u5728\u5e74\u8f15\u5973\u6027\u7b49\u98f2\u98df\u8f03\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u65cf\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u6703\u56e0\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\u800c\u9ad4\u91cd\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u500b\u4eba\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u6f5b\u5728\u8377\u723e\u8499\u56e0\u7d20\u5c0d\u5065\u6021\u53ef\u6a02\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5c0d\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u71df\u990a\u5f71\u97ff\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u3002", "author": "Yicheng Qi et.al.", "authors": "Yicheng Qi, Ang Li", "id": "2405.10746v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10746v1", "repo": "null"}}

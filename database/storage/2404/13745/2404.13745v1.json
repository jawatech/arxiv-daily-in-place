In this article we present the first dataset of\nrhino-cytological field images: the NCD (Nasal Cytology Dataset), aimed to\ntrain and deploy Object Detection models to support physicians and biologists\nduring clinical practice. The real distribution of the cytotypes, populating\nthe nasal mucosa has been replicated, sampling images from slides of clinical\npatients, and manually annotating each cell found on them. The correspondent\nobject detection task presents non'trivial issues associated with the strong\nclass imbalancement, involving the rarest cell types. This work contributes to\nsome of open challenges by presenting a novel machine learning-based approach\nto aid the automated detection and classification of nasal mucosa cells: the\nDETR and YOLO models shown good performance in detecting cells and classifying\nthem correctly, revealing great potential to accelerate the work of rhinology\nexperts.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Mauro Camporeale et.al.", "authors": "Mauro Camporeale,Giovanni Dimauro,Matteo Gelardi,Giorgia Iacobellis,Mattia Sebastiano Ladisa,Sergio Latrofa,Nunzia Lomonte", "id": "2404.13745v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13745v1", "repo": "null"}}

This is partly\nbecause these expressions do not derive their meanings solely from their\nconstituent words, but also due to the scarcity of relevant data resources, and\ntheir impact on the performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation\nand simplification. In this paper we propose an approach to model idiomaticity\neffectively using a triplet loss that incorporates the asymmetric contribution\nof components words to an idiomatic meaning for training language models by\nusing adaptive contrastive learning and resampling miners to build an\nidiomatic-aware learning objective. Our proposed method is evaluated on a\nSemEval challenge and outperforms previous alternatives significantly in many\nmetrics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u4e2d\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5efa\u6a21\u6163\u7528\u8a9e\u6216\u975e\u7d44\u5408\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u9577\u671f\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u9019\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u4e9b\u8868\u9054\u5f0f\u4e26\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u5f9e\u5176\u7d44\u6210\u8a5e\u5f59\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5176\u542b\u7fa9\uff0c\u4e5f\u7531\u65bc\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u6599\u8cc7\u6e90\u7684\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\u548c\u7c21\u5316\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u57f7\u884c\u6548\u80fd\u6240\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u7d44\u640d\u5931\u4f86\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u6163\u7528\u8a9e\uff0c\u8a72\u640d\u5931\u5c07\u7d44\u6210\u8a5e\u5f59\u5c0d\u6163\u7528\u8a9e\u542b\u7fa9\u7684\u4e0d\u5c0d\u7a31\u8ca2\u737b\u7d0d\u5165\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u62bd\u6a23\u7926\u5de5\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u6163\u7528\u8a9e\u611f\u77e5\u5b78\u7fd2\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 SemEval \u6311\u6230\u4e2d\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u6307\u6a19\u4e2d\u90fd\u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "author": "Wei He et.al.", "authors": "Wei He, Marco Idiart, Carolina Scarton, Aline Villavicencio", "id": "2406.15175v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15175v1", "repo": "null"}}

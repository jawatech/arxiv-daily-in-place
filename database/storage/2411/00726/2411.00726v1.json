As two different imaging tools for DR grading,\ncolor fundus photography (CFP) and infrared fundus photography (IFP) are\nhighly-correlated and complementary in clinical applications. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study that explores a novel multi-modal deep\nlearning framework to fuse the information from CFP and IFP towards more\naccurate DR grading. Specifically, we construct a dual-stream architecture\nCross-Fundus Transformer (CFT) to fuse the ViT-based features of two fundus\nimage modalities. In particular, a meticulously engineered Cross-Fundus\nAttention (CFA) module is introduced to capture the correspondence between CFP\nand IFP images. Moreover, we adopt both the single-modality and multi-modality\nsupervisions to maximize the overall performance for DR grading. Extensive\nexperiments on a clinical dataset consisting of 1,713 pairs of multi-modal\nfundus images demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our code will\nbe released for public access.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8996\u7db2\u819c\u75c5\u8b8a (DR) \u662f\u5168\u7403\u5931\u660e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7684\u5e38\u898b\u4f75\u767c\u75c7\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba DR \u5206\u7d1a\u7684\u5169\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f69\u8272\u773c\u5e95\u651d\u5f71 (CFP) \u548c\u7d05\u5916\u7dda\u773c\u5e95\u651d\u5f71 (IFP) \u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u95dc\u4e14\u4e92\u88dc\u3002\u64da\u6211\u5011\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u63a2\u8a0e\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u878d\u5408 CFP \u548c IFP \u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684 DR \u5206\u7d1a\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u69cb\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u96d9\u6d41\u67b6\u69cb Cross-Fundus Transformer (CFT)\uff0c\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u5169\u7a2e\u773c\u5e95\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u65bc ViT \u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684 Cross-Fundus Attention (CFA) \u6a21\u7d44\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349 CFP \u548c IFP \u5f71\u50cf\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5c0d\u61c9\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u55ae\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u76e3\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316 DR \u5206\u7d1a\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u7531 1,713 \u5c0d\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u773c\u5e95\u5f71\u50cf\u7d44\u6210\u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u512a\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u5c07\u6703\u516c\u958b\u767c\u5e03\u3002", "author": "Fan Xiao et.al.", "authors": "Fan Xiao, Junlin Hou, Ruiwei Zhao, Rui Feng, Haidong Zou, Lina Lu, Yi Xu, Juzhao Zhang", "id": "2411.00726v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00726v1", "repo": "null"}}

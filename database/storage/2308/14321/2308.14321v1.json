However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload\nhealthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their\napplication in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of\ndiagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline\nan innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of\nautomated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical\nknowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: Dr.Knows, inspired by the\nclinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National\nLibrary of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust\nrepository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for\npre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in\nthe interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using\nreal-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the\naccuracy of automated diagnosis generation. More importantly, our approach\noffers an explainable diagnostic pathway, edging us closer to the realization\nof AI-augmented diagnostic decision support systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yanjun Gao et.al.", "authors": "Yanjun Gao,Ruizhe Li,John Caskey,Dmitriy Dligach,Timothy Miller,Matthew M.

Analysis and Ingredients for Mutual Information Skill Learning", "paper_summary": "Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key\nchallenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation\nlearning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that\nmoving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain\nWasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue\nthat the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the\nexisting framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis\nsuggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the\nexcellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights\nconnections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and\nsuccessor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide\nfurther insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u6211\u76e3\u7763\u5b78\u7fd2\u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u89e3\u6c7a\u7576\u4eca\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7e\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u8868\u5fb5\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u734e\u52f5\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff08METRA\uff09\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ad6\u8b49\u4e86\u9060\u96e2\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e26\u6539\u70ba\u512a\u5316\u67d0\u500b Wasserstein \u8ddd\u96e2\u5c0d\u65bc\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8ad6\u8b49\u8a72\u8ad6\u6587\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08MISL\uff09\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5167\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684 MISL \u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5f8c\u7e7c\u7279\u5fb5\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86 METRA \u7684\u51fa\u8272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e86\u6d3b\u52d5\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e26\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6280\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u3001\u5c0d\u6bd4\u8868\u5fb5\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5f8c\u7e7c\u7279\u5fb5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u806f\u7e6b\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u901a\u904e\u4ed4\u7d30\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c METRA \u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u95dc\u9375\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "author": "Chongyi Zheng et.al.", "authors": "Chongyi Zheng, Jens Tuyls, Joanne Peng, Benjamin Eysenbach", "id": "2412.08021v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08021v1", "repo": "null"}}

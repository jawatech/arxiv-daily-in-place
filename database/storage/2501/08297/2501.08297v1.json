Multivariate polynomials\nof bounded tree-width have been studied by Makowsky and Meer as a new sparsity\ncondition that allows for polynomial solvability of problems which are\nintractable in general. We consider a variation on this theme for Boolean\nvariables. A representation of a Boolean function as the sign of a polynomial\nis called a polynomial threshold representation. We discuss Boolean functions\nrepresentable as polynomial threshold functions of bounded tree-width and\npresent two applications to Bayesian network classifiers, a probabilistic\ngraphical model. Both applications are in Explainable Artificial Intelligence\n(XAI), the research area dealing with the black-box nature of many recent\nmachine learning models. We also give a separation result between the\nrepresentational power of positive and general polynomial threshold functions.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u8b8a\u91cf\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u7684\u6a39\u5bec\u5ea6\u662f\u8207\u5176\u9805\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u8d85\u5716\u7684\u6a39\u5bec\u5ea6\u3002Makowsky \u548c Meer \u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u6a39\u5bec\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u8b8a\u91cf\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u689d\u4ef6\uff0c\u5141\u8a31\u5c0d\u4e00\u822c\u96e3\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u7684\u554f\u984c\u9032\u884c\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8003\u616e\u4e86\u5e03\u6797\u8b8a\u6578\u7684\u9019\u500b\u4e3b\u984c\u8b8a\u9ad4\u3002\u5e03\u6797\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u70ba\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u7684\u7b26\u865f\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u95be\u503c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u6709\u754c\u6a39\u5bec\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u95be\u503c\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u5e03\u6797\u51fd\u6578\uff0c\u4e26\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u8c9d\u6c0f\u7db2\u8def\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff08\u4e00\u7a2e\u6a5f\u7387\u5716\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u5169\u500b\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u9019\u5169\u500b\u61c9\u7528\u90fd\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08XAI\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u8a31\u591a\u8fd1\u671f\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6027\u8cea\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9818\u57df\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u7d66\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u95be\u503c\u51fd\u6578\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u95be\u503c\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5206\u96e2\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "author": "Karine Chubarian et.al.", "authors": "Karine Chubarian, Johnny Joyce, Gyorgy Turan", "id": "2501.08297v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08297v1", "repo": "null"}}

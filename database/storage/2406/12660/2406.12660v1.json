However, as\nsophisticated AI-based systems are often black-boxed, rendering the\ndecision-making logic opaque, users find it challenging to comply with their\nrecommendations. Although researchers are investigating Explainable AI (XAI) to\nincrease the transparency of the underlying machine learning models, it is\nunclear what types of explanations are effective and what other factors\nincrease compliance. To better understand the interplay of these factors, we\nconducted an experiment with 562 participants who were presented with the\nrecommendations of an AI and two different types of XAI. We find that users'\ncompliance increases with the introduction of XAI but is also affected by AI\nliteracy. We also find that the relationships between AI literacy XAI and\nusers' compliance are mediated by the users' mental model of AI. Our study has\nseveral implications for successfully designing AI-based systems utilizing XAI.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457 AI \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9818\u57df\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u8907\u96dc\u7684 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f5c\u696d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6c7a\u7b56\u908f\u8f2f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u767c\u73fe\u5f88\u96e3\u9075\u5b88\u5efa\u8b70\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u6b63\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb AI (XAI) \u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u790e\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u54ea\u4e9b\u985e\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u6703\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u9019\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d 562 \u540d\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u88ab\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 AI \u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u548c\u5169\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684 XAI\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u96a8\u8457 XAI \u7684\u5f15\u5165\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6703\u53d7\u5230 AI \u7d20\u990a\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe AI \u7d20\u990a XAI \u8207\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u662f\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5c0d AI \u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u8abf\u7bc0\u7684\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c0d\u6210\u529f\u8a2d\u8a08\u5229\u7528 XAI \u7684 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u6709\u5e7e\u500b\u555f\u793a\u3002", "author": "Niklas K\u00fchl et.al.", "authors": "Niklas K\u00fchl, Christian Meske, Maximilian Nitsche, Jodie Lobana", "id": "2406.12660v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12660v1", "repo": "null"}}

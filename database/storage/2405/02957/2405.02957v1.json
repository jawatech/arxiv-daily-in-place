All patients, nurses,\nand doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our\ncentral goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within\nthe simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the\nsimulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases\nand LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful\nand unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment\nperformance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More\ninterestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital\nis applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten\nthousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved\ndoctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the\nMedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way\nfor advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical\nscenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Junkai Li et.al.", "authors": "Junkai Li,Siyu Wang,Meng Zhang,Weitao Li,Yunghwei Lai,Xinhui Kang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu", "id": "2405.02957v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02957v1", "repo": "null"}}

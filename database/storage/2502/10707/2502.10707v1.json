Although\nprevious ECG self-supervised learning (eSSL) methods have made significant\nprogress in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they typically\ntreat ECG signals as ordinary time-series data, segmenting the signals using\nfixed-size and fixed-step time windows, which often ignore the form and rhythm\ncharacteristics and latent semantic relationships in ECG signals. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel perspective on ECG signals, treating heartbeats as words\nand rhythms as sentences. Based on this perspective, we first designed the\nQRS-Tokenizer, which generates semantically meaningful ECG sentences from the\nraw ECG signals. Building on these, we then propose HeartLang, a novel\nself-supervised learning framework for ECG language processing, learning\ngeneral representations at form and rhythm levels. Additionally, we construct\nthe largest heartbeat-based ECG vocabulary to date, which will further advance\nthe development of ECG language processing. We evaluated HeartLang across six\npublic ECG datasets, where it demonstrated robust competitiveness against other\neSSL methods.

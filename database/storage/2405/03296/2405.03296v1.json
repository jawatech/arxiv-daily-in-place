Most SGCNs adopt polynomial\nfilters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus\non which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models'\narchitecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in\nterms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis\nare stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in\nexisting SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition\noperation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop\nnovel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor\ndecomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable\nperformance improvements.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Feng Huang et.al.", "authors": "Feng Huang,Wen Zhang", "id": "2405.03296v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03296v1", "repo": "null"}}

During the validation over 3 months, the product served predictions\nfrom over 3000 models to more than 25 application, platform, and operation\nteams, covering 63\\% of major incidents and reducing the mean-time-to-detect\n(MTTD) by more than 7 minutes. Unlike previous anomaly detection methods, our\nsolution leverages statistical, ML and deep learning models while continuing to\nincorporate rule-based static thresholds to incorporate domain-specific\nknowledge. Both univariate and multivariate ML models are deployed and\nmaintained through distributed services for scalability and high availability.\nAIDR has a feedback loop that assesses model quality with a combination of\ndrift detection algorithms and customer feedback. It also offers\nself-onboarding capabilities and customizability. AIDR has achieved success\nwith various internal teams with lower time to detection and fewer false\npositives than previous methods. As we move forward, we aim to expand incident\ncoverage and prevention, reduce noise, and integrate further with root cause\nrecommendation (RCR) to enable an end-to-end AIDR experience.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Hanzhang Wang et.al.", "authors": "Hanzhang Wang,Gowtham Kumar Tangirala,Gilkara Pranav Naidu,Charles Mayville,Arighna Roy,Joanne Sun,Ramesh Babu Mandava", "id": "2404.16887v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16887v1", "repo": "null"}}

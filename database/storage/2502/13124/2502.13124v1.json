To\novercome this limitation, we introduce a scalable approach for generating\ndiverse and challenging reasoning questions, accompanied by reference answers.\nWe present NaturalReasoning, a comprehensive dataset comprising 2.8 million\nquestions that span multiple domains, including STEM fields (e.g., Physics,\nComputer Science), Economics, Social Sciences, and more. We demonstrate the\nutility of the questions in NaturalReasoning through knowledge distillation\nexperiments which show that NaturalReasoning can effectively elicit and\ntransfer reasoning capabilities from a strong teacher model. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that NaturalReasoning is also effective for unsupervised\nself-training using external reward models or self-rewarding.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u900f\u904e\u8d85\u8d8a\u50b3\u7d71\u9818\u57df\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6578\u5b78\u548c\u7de8\u78bc\uff09\u4f86\u64f4\u5145\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u5230\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u5143\u4e14\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u554f\u984c\u7684\u963b\u7919\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7522\u751f\u591a\u5143\u4e14\u5177\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e26\u9644\u4e0a\u53c3\u8003\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa NaturalReasoning\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5305\u542b 280 \u842c\u500b\u554f\u984c\u7684\u7d9c\u5408\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb\u591a\u500b\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec STEM \u9818\u57df\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7269\u7406\u3001\u96fb\u8166\u79d1\u5b78\uff09\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u3001\u793e\u6703\u79d1\u5b78\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5c55\u793a NaturalReasoning \u4e2d\u554f\u984c\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a NaturalReasoning \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u767c\u548c\u8f49\u79fb\u5f37\u5927\u6559\u5e2b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a NaturalReasoning \u4e5f\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u734e\u52f5\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u81ea\u6211\u734e\u52f5\u7684\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u81ea\u6211\u8a13\u7df4\u3002", "author": "Weizhe Yuan et.al.", "authors": "Weizhe Yuan, Jane Yu, Song Jiang, Karthik Padthe, Yang Li, Dong Wang, Ilia Kulikov, Kyunghyun Cho, Yuandong Tian, Jason E Weston, Xian Li", "id": "2502.13124v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13124v1", "repo": "null"}}

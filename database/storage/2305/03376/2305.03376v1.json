Since invisible labour, including labelling and maintenance work, is\nan integral part of contemporary AI systems, it remains important to sensitise\nusers to its role. We suggest that this could be done through explainable AI\n(XAI) design, particularly feminist intersectional XAI. We propose the method\nof cartography, which stems from feminist intersectional research, to draw out\na systemic perspective of AI and include dimensions of AI that pertain to\ninvisible labour.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7576\u4ee3\u901a\u904e AI \u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5e55\u5f8c\u4eba\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u901a\u5e38\u65e2\u4e0d\u53ef\u898b\u4e14\u85aa\u8cc7\u904e\u4f4e\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u4e0d\u53ef\u898b\u7684\u52de\u52d5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a19\u7c64\u548c\u7dad\u8b77\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u662f\u7576\u4ee3 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u89d2\u8272\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u9019\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684 AI\uff08XAI\uff09\u8a2d\u8a08\u4f86\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5973\u6027\u4e3b\u7fa9\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684 XAI\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u6e90\u81ea\u5973\u6027\u4e3b\u7fa9\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u88fd\u5716\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u51fa AI \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u89c0\u9ede\uff0c\u4e26\u7d0d\u5165\u8207\u4e0d\u53ef\u898b\u52de\u52d5\u76f8\u95dc\u7684 AI \u7dad\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Goda Klumbyte et.al.", "authors": "Goda Klumbyte, Hannah Piehl, Claude Draude", "id": "2305.03376v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03376v1", "repo": "null"}}

In this paper, we introduce a prioritized form of a\ncombination of state-of-the-art approaches such as Deep Q-learning (DQN) and\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to outperform the earlier results for\ncontinuous state and action space problems. Our experiments also involve the\nuse of parameter noise during training resulting in more robust deep RL models\noutperforming the earlier results significantly. We believe these results are a\nvaluable addition for continuous state and action space problems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u773e\u591a\u7684 RL \u8b8a\u7a2e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u554f\u984c\u985e\u5225\u662f\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u662f\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u2014\u2014\u81ea\u99d5\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u81ea\u99d5\u8eca\u8f1b\u3001\u6700\u4f73\u63a7\u5236\u90fd\u662f\u6b64\u985e\u554f\u984c\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u800c\u7136\u5730\u501f\u7528\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u5177\u6709\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u512a\u5148\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Deep Q \u5b78\u7fd2 (DQN) \u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6 (DDPG)\uff0c\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u9023\u7e8c\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u554f\u984c\u7684\u5148\u524d\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u9084\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u4f7f\u7528\u53c3\u6578\u96dc\u8a0a\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6 RL \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u679c\u5c0d\u9023\u7e8c\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u9593\u554f\u984c\u662f\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u88dc\u5145\u3002", "author": "Rajesh Mangannavar et.al.", "authors": "Rajesh Mangannavar, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasaraghavan", "id": "2410.11250v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11250v1", "repo": "null"}}

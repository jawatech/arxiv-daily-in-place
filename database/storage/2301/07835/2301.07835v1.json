Our analysis is focused towards understanding the\nrelationship between prediction accuracy and overall performance of deployed\nRMAB systems. This is crucial for determining the value of investing in\nimproving predictive accuracy towards improving the final system performance,\nand is useful for diagnosing, monitoring deployed RMAB systems.\n  Using real-world data from our deployed RMAB system, we demonstrate that an\nimprovement in overall prediction accuracy may even be accompanied by a\ndegradation in the performance of RMAB system -- a broad investment of\nresources to improve overall prediction accuracy may not yield expected\nresults. Following this, we develop decision-focused evaluation metrics to\nevaluate the predictive component and show that it is better at explaining\n(both empirically and theoretically) the overall performance of a deployed RMAB\nsystem.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Paritosh Verma et.al.", "authors": "Paritosh Verma,Shresth Verma,Aditya Mate,Aparna Taneja,Milind Tambe", "id": "2301.07835v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07835v1", "repo": "null"}}

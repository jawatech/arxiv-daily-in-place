{"2406.17650": {"publish_time": "2024-06-25", "title": "ELIZA Reinterpreted: The world's first chatbot was not intended as a chatbot at all", "paper_summary": "ELIZA, often considered the world's first chatbot, was written by Joseph\nWeizenbaum in the early 1960s. Weizenbaum did not intend to invent the chatbot,\nbut rather to build a platform for research into human-machine conversation and\nthe important cognitive processes of interpretation and misinterpretation. His\npurpose was obscured by ELIZA's fame, resulting in large part from the\nfortuitous timing of it's creation, and it's escape into the wild. In this\npaper I provide a rich historical context for ELIZA's creation, demonstrating\nthat ELIZA arose from the intersection of some of the central threads in the\ntechnical history of AI. I also briefly discuss how ELIZA escaped into the\nworld, and how its accidental escape, along with several coincidental turns of\nthe programming language screws, led both to the misapprehension that ELIZA was\nintended as a chatbot, and to the loss of the original ELIZA to history for\nover 50 years.", "paper_summary_zh": "ELIZA\uff0c\u5e38\u88ab\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7531\u7d04\u745f\u592b\u00b7\u9b4f\u68ee\u9b91\u59c6\u5728 1960 \u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u671f\u7de8\u5beb\u3002\u9b4f\u68ee\u9b91\u59c6\u4e26\u975e\u6709\u610f\u767c\u660e\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u70ba\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u6a5f\u5c0d\u8a71\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u8aa4\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8a8d\u77e5\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u88ab ELIZA \u7684\u540d\u8072\u6240\u63a9\u84cb\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u5275\u4f5c\u7684\u6642\u6a5f\u5de7\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u9003\u9038\u5230\u91ce\u5916\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u70ba ELIZA \u7684\u5275\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u8b49\u660e ELIZA \u4f86\u81ea\u65bc AI \u6280\u8853\u53f2\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7dda\u7d22\u7684\u4ea4\u532f\u8655\u3002\u6211\u4e5f\u7c21\u8981\u5730\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86 ELIZA \u5982\u4f55\u9003\u9038\u5230\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u610f\u5916\u9003\u9038\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7de8\u7a0b\u8a9e\u8a00\u87ba\u7d72\u7684\u5e7e\u500b\u5de7\u5408\u8f49\u6298\uff0c\u65e2\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e86 ELIZA \u88ab\u8aa4\u89e3\u70ba\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e86\u539f\u59cb ELIZA \u5728\u6b77\u53f2\u4e0a\u907a\u5931\u4e86 50 \u591a\u5e74\u3002", "author": "Jeff Shrager et.al.", "authors": "Jeff Shrager", "id": "2406.17650v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17650v1", "repo": "null"}}

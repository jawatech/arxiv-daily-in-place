{"2410.01380": {"publish_time": "2024-10-02", "title": "Knowledge Entropy Decay during Language Model Pretraining Hinders New Knowledge Acquisition", "paper_summary": "In this work, we investigate how a model's tendency to broadly integrate its\nparametric knowledge evolves throughout pretraining, and how this behavior\naffects overall performance, particularly in terms of knowledge acquisition and\nforgetting. We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the\nrange of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy\nindicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low\nknowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty.\nOur analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining\nadvances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction\nin the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude\nthat diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources)\nimpairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find\nfurther support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of\ninactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition\nand retention.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a21\u578b\u5ee3\u6cdb\u6574\u5408\u5176\u53c3\u6578\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u4e2d\u6f14\u8b8a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b64\u884c\u70ba\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u548c\u907a\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u77e5\u8b58\u71b5\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b83\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u4f86\u6e90\u7bc4\u570d\uff1b\u9ad8\u77e5\u8b58\u71b5\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u4f86\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u77e5\u8b58\u71b5\u5247\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u78ba\u5b9a\u5730\u4f9d\u8cf4\u7279\u5b9a\u4f86\u6e90\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5206\u6790\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u63a8\u9032\uff0c\u77e5\u8b58\u71b5\u6301\u7e8c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0b\u964d\u8207\u6a21\u578b\u7372\u53d6\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u95dc\uff0c\u9019\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff1a\u77e5\u8b58\u71b5\u905e\u6e1b\uff08\u8f03\u5c11\u7684\u6d3b\u8e8d\u8a18\u61b6\u4f86\u6e90\u6578\u91cf\uff09\u6703\u640d\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u9019\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8b49\u660e\u589e\u52a0\u975e\u6d3b\u8e8d\u8a18\u61b6\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u6d3b\u52d5\u6027\u6703\u589e\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u7372\u53d6\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "author": "Jiyeon Kim et.al.", "authors": "Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hyowon Cho, Joel Jang, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungpil Won, Youbin Ahn, Dohaeng Lee, Minjoon Seo", "id": "2410.01380v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01380v1", "repo": "null"}}

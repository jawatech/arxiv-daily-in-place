As a motivation, consider recommendation systems that use\nonline algorithms to learn optimal product recommendations based on user and\nproduct attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations\naffects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user\nattributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user\npreferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the\nmodel assumption of a static environment, and the reality of an evolving\nenvironment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we first\nintroduce a model for a generic coupled evolution of the parameters that are\nbeing learned, and the environment that is affected by it. We then frame a\nlinear bandit recommendation system (RS) into this generic model where the\nusers are characterized by a state variable that evolves based on the sequence\nof recommendations. The learning algorithm of the RS does not explicitly\naccount for this evolution and assumes that the users are static. A dynamical\nsystem model that captures the coupled evolution of the population state and\nthe learning algorithm is described, and its equilibrium behavior is analyzed.\nWe show that when the recommendation algorithm is able to learn the population\npreferences in the presence of this mismatch, the algorithm induces similarity\nin the preferences of the user population. In particular, we present results on\nhow different properties of the recommendation algorithm, namely the user\nattribute space and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, effect the\npopulation preferences when they are learned by the algorithm. We demonstrate\nthese results using model simulations.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u7dda\u4e0a\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c0d\u5176\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u52d5\u6a5f\uff0c\u8003\u616e\u4f7f\u7528\u7dda\u4e0a\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u6700\u4f73\u7522\u54c1\u63a8\u85a6\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u8a72\u7cfb\u7d71\u662f\u6839\u64da\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u548c\u7522\u54c1\u5c6c\u6027\u3002\u773e\u6240\u5468\u77e5\uff0c\u63a8\u85a6\u9806\u5e8f\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c07\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5c6c\u6027\u8996\u70ba\u975c\u614b\u7684\uff0c\u4e26\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u63a8\u85a6\u5c0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u662f\u5206\u6790\u975c\u614b\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8a2d\u8207\u53d7\u63a8\u85a6\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u74b0\u5883\u73fe\u5be6\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u57f7\u884c\u6b64\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u70ba\u6b63\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u53c3\u6578\u548c\u53d7\u5176\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u901a\u7528\u8026\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u7dda\u6027\u8ced\u5f92\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71 (RS) \u69cb\u5efa\u5230\u9019\u500b\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4ee5\u6839\u64da\u63a8\u85a6\u9806\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u72c0\u614b\u8b8a\u6578\u70ba\u7279\u5fb5\u3002RS \u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e26\u672a\u660e\u78ba\u8003\u616e\u6b64\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e26\u5047\u8a2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u662f\u975c\u614b\u7684\u3002\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6355\u6349\u65cf\u7fa4\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5e73\u8861\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7576\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u5b78\u7fd2\u65cf\u7fa4\u504f\u597d\u6642\uff0c\u8a72\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6703\u8a98\u5c0e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u65cf\u7fa4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5c6c\u6027\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5c6c\u6027\u7a7a\u9593\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u958b\u767c\u6b0a\u8861\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u6642\u65cf\u7fa4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u64ec\u4f86\u8b49\u660e\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u679c\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Prabhat Lankireddy et.al.", "authors": "Prabhat Lankireddy, Jayakrishnan Nair, D Manjunath", "id": "2411.13883v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13883v1", "repo": "null"}}

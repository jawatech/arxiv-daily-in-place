We propose Propper, which handles flawed\nand probabilistic background knowledge by extending ILP with a combination of\nneurosymbolic inference, a continuous criterion for hypothesis selection (BCE)\nand a relaxation of the hypothesis constrainer (NoisyCombo). For relational\npatterns in noisy images, Propper can learn programs from as few as 8 examples.\nIt outperforms binary ILP and statistical models such as a Graph Neural\nNetwork.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u6b78\u7d0d\u908f\u8f2f\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a2d\u8a08 (ILP) \u65b9\u6cd5\u7121\u6cd5\u5f9e\u6a5f\u7387\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8b58\u5b78\u7fd2\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4f86\u81ea\u611f\u6e2c\u5668\u8cc7\u6599\u6216\u5177\u6709\u6a5f\u7387\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa Propper\uff0c\u5b83\u900f\u904e\u5c07 ILP \u8207\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7528\u65bc\u5047\u8a2d\u9078\u64c7\u7684\u9023\u7e8c\u6e96\u5247 (BCE) \u548c\u5047\u8a2d\u7d04\u675f\u9b06\u5f1b (NoisyCombo) \u7684\u7d44\u5408\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u4e14\u6a5f\u7387\u6027\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u96dc\u8a0a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0cPropper \u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u5c11\u81f3 8 \u500b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5b78\u7fd2\u7a0b\u5f0f\u3002\u5b83\u512a\u65bc\u4e8c\u5143 ILP \u548c\u7d71\u8a08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u3002", "author": "Fieke Hillerstrom et.al.", "authors": "Fieke Hillerstrom, Gertjan Burghouts", "id": "2408.11367v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11367v1", "repo": "null"}}

This\ndataset is motivated by the increasing use of sUAS in disaster response and the\nlack of previous work in utilizing high-resolution geospatial sUAS imagery for\nmachine learning and computer vision models, the lack of alignment with\noperational use cases, and with hopes of enabling further investigations\nbetween sUAS and satellite imagery. The CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset consists of\nfifty-two (52) orthomosaics from ten (10) federally declared disasters\n(Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane\nLaura, Hurricane Michael, Musset Bayou Fire, Mayfield Tornado, Kilauea\nEruption, and Champlain Towers Collapse) spanning 67.98 square kilometers\n(26.245 square miles), containing 21,716 building polygons and damage labels,\nand 7,880 adjustment annotations. The imagery was tiled and presented in\nconjunction with overlaid building polygons to a pool of 130 annotators who\nprovided human judgments of damage according to the Joint Damage Scale. These\nannotations were then reviewed via a two-stage review process in which building\npolygon damage labels were first reviewed individually and then again by\ncommittee. Additionally, the building polygons have been aligned spatially to\nprecisely overlap with the imagery to enable more performant machine learning\nmodels to be trained. It appears that CRASAR-U-DRIODs is the largest labeled\ndataset of sUAS orthomosaic imagery.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u672c\u6587\u4ef6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5354\u52a9\u641c\u5c0b\u548c\u6551\u63f4\u4e2d\u5fc3 - \u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u7cfb\u7d71 - \u707d\u96e3\u61c9\u8b8a\u822a\u62cd\u6aa2\u6e2c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 (CRASAR-U-DROIDs)\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5efa\u7bc9\u640d\u5bb3\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u7a7a\u9593\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u6536\u96c6\u81ea\u5c0f\u578b\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f (sUAS) \u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u5f71\u50cf\u3002\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u52d5\u6a5f\u4f86\u81ea\u65bc sUAS \u5728\u707d\u96e3\u61c9\u8b8a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5148\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6 sUAS \u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u5f71\u50cf\u9032\u884c\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u96fb\u8166\u8996\u89ba\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8207\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e0c\u671b\u4fc3\u6210 sUAS \u548c\u885b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e4b\u9593\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8abf\u67e5\u3002CRASAR-U-DROIDs \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u4f86\u81ea\u5341 (10) \u500b\u806f\u90a6\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u707d\u96e3 (\u4f0a\u6069\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u827e\u9054\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u54c8\u7dad\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u4f0a\u9054\u8389\u4e9e\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u52de\u62c9\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u9ea5\u53ef\u98b6\u98a8\u3001\u99ac\u585e\u7279\u7063\u5927\u706b\u3001\u6885\u83f2\u723e\u5fb7\u9f8d\u6372\u98a8\u3001\u57fa\u62c9\u97cb\u5384\u706b\u5c71\u7206\u767c\u548c\u5c1a\u666e\u862d\u5927\u5ec8\u5012\u584c) \u7684\u4e94\u5341\u4e8c (52) \u500b\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb 67.98 \u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc (26.245 \u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u91cc)\uff0c\u5305\u542b 21,716 \u500b\u5efa\u7bc9\u591a\u908a\u5f62\u548c\u640d\u5bb3\u6a19\u7c64\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 7,880 \u500b\u8abf\u6574\u8a3b\u89e3\u3002\u5f71\u50cf\u4ee5\u62fc\u8cbc\u65b9\u5f0f\u5448\u73fe\uff0c\u4e26\u8207\u758a\u52a0\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\u591a\u908a\u5f62\u4e00\u8d77\u5448\u73fe\u7d66 130 \u4f4d\u8a3b\u89e3\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u6839\u64da\u806f\u5408\u640d\u5bb3\u91cf\u8868\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u70ba\u640d\u5bb3\u5224\u65b7\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\u900f\u904e\u5169\u968e\u6bb5\u5be9\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5be9\u67e5\u9019\u4e9b\u8a3b\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5efa\u7bc9\u591a\u908a\u5f62\u640d\u5bb3\u6a19\u7c64\u5148\u500b\u5225\u5be9\u67e5\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u518d\u7531\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u5be9\u67e5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5efa\u7bc9\u591a\u908a\u5f62\u5df2\u5728\u7a7a\u9593\u4e0a\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8207\u5f71\u50cf\u7cbe\u78ba\u91cd\u758a\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u3002CRASAR-U-DROIDs \u770b\u4f3c\u662f\u6a19\u7c64\u6700\u591a\u7684 sUAS \u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Thomas Manzini et.al.", "authors": "Thomas Manzini, Priyankari Perali, Raisa Karnik, Robin Murphy", "id": "2407.17673v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17673v1", "repo": "null"}}

To enable\nresearchers to answer such questions with quantitative approaches such as\nnatural language processing, we provide the SpeakGer data set, consisting of\nGerman parliament debates from all 16 federal states of Germany as well as the\nGerman Bundestag from 1947-2023, split into a total of 10,806,105 speeches.\nThis data set includes rich meta data in form of information on both reactions\nfrom the audience towards the speech as well as information about the speaker's\nparty, their age, their constituency and their party's political alignment,\nwhich enables a deeper analysis. We further provide three exploratory analyses,\ndetailing topic shares of different parties throughout time, a descriptive\nanalysis of the development of the age of an average speaker as well as a\nsentiment analysis of speeches of different parties with regards to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6f14\u8b1b\u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5206\u6790\u55ae\u4eba\u7121\u6cd5\u8b80\u5b8c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u4e9b\u6587\u672c\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u5e38\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u95dc\u9375\u7684\u5143\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6f14\u8b1b\u8005\u7684\u653f\u9ee8\u3001\u5e74\u9f61\u6216\u9078\u5340\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u63d0\u4f9b\u91dd\u5c0d\u66f4\u7cbe\u7d30\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u554f\u984c\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8b93\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u80fd\u5920\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7b49\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u56de\u7b54\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 SpeakGer \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4f86\u81ea\u5fb7\u570b\u6240\u6709 16 \u500b\u806f\u90a6\u5dde\u4ee5\u53ca 1947-2023 \u5e74\u5fb7\u570b\u806f\u90a6\u8b70\u9662\u7684\u5fb7\u8a9e\u8b70\u6703\u8faf\u8ad6\uff0c\u5171\u5206\u70ba 10,806,105 \u7bc7\u6f14\u8b1b\u3002\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u5143\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u89c0\u773e\u5c0d\u6f14\u8b1b\u7684\u53cd\u61c9\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f14\u8b1b\u8005\u7684\u653f\u9ee8\u3001\u5e74\u9f61\u3001\u9078\u5340\u548c\u653f\u9ee8\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u5834\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73fe\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6210\u70ba\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u9805\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8a73\u7d30\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u9ee8\u96a8\u8457\u6642\u9593\u63a8\u79fb\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u4efd\u984d\u3001\u5c0d\u5e73\u5747\u6f14\u8b1b\u8005\u5e74\u9f61\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u9ee8\u5728 COVID-19 \u5927\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f14\u8b1b\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u5206\u6790\u3002", "author": "Kai-Robin Lange et.al.", "authors": "Kai-Robin Lange, Carsten Jentsch", "id": "2410.17886v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17886v1", "repo": "null"}}

Typically, DVRPs involve two stakeholders: service providers\nthat deliver services to customers and customers who raise requests from\ndifferent locations. Many real-world applications can be formulated as DVRP\nsuch as ridesharing and non-compliance capture. Apart from original objectives\nlike optimising total utility or efficiency, DVRP should also consider fairness\nfor all parties. Unfairness can induce service providers and customers to give\nup on the systems, leading to negative financial and social impacts. However,\nmost existing DVRP-related applications focus on improving fairness from a\nsingle side, and there have been few works considering two-sided fairness and\nutility optimisation concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel framework, a\nTwo-sided Fairness-aware Genetic Algorithm (named 2FairGA), which expands the\ngenetic algorithm from the original objective solely focusing on utility to\nmulti-objectives that incorporate two-sided fairness. Subsequently, the impact\nof injecting two fairness definitions into the utility-focused model and the\ncorrelation between any pair of the three objectives are explored. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to\nthe state-of-the-art.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u52d5\u614b\u8eca\u8f1b\u8def\u7dda\u554f\u984c (DVRP) \u662f\u7d93\u5178\u8eca\u8f1b\u8def\u7dda\u554f\u984c (VRP) \u7684\u5ef6\u4f38\uff0c\u800c VRP \u662f\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u904b\u8f38\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u554f\u984c\u3002\u901a\u5e38\uff0cDVRP \u6d89\u53ca\u5169\u500b\u5229\u5bb3\u95dc\u4fc2\u4eba\uff1a\u5411\u5ba2\u6236\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52d9\u7684\u670d\u52d9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u9ede\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5ba2\u6236\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u8ff0\u70ba DVRP\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5171\u4e58\u548c\u975e\u9806\u5f9e\u6027\u64f7\u53d6\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u512a\u5316\u7e3d\u6548\u7528\u6216\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u539f\u59cb\u76ee\u6a19\u4e4b\u5916\uff0cDVRP \u9084\u61c9\u8003\u616e\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u670d\u52d9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u5ba2\u6236\u653e\u68c4\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u9020\u6210\u8ca0\u9762\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u548c\u793e\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u73fe\u6709\u7684 DVRP \u76f8\u95dc\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u90fd\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5f9e\u55ae\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u540c\u6642\u8003\u616e\u96d9\u908a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u96d9\u908a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u907a\u50b3\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u7a31\u70ba 2FairGA\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u907a\u50b3\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f9e\u539f\u672c\u50c5\u95dc\u6ce8\u6548\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u542b\u96d9\u908a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u63a2\u8a0e\u5c07\u5169\u500b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u7fa9\u6ce8\u5165\u4ee5\u6548\u7528\u70ba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e09\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\u4e4b\u9593\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u5c0d\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002", "author": "Yufan Kang et.al.", "authors": "Yufan Kang, Rongsheng Zhang, Wei Shao, Flora D.

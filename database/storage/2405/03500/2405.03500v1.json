The increasing\ndemand for visual analysis applications, particularly in classification tasks,\nhas emphasized the significance of considering semantic distortion in\ncompressed images. To bridge the gap between image compression and visual\nanalysis, we propose a Rate-Distortion-Classification (RDC) model for lossy\nimage compression, offering a unified framework to optimize the trade-off\nbetween rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The RDC model is\nextensively analyzed both statistically on a multi-distribution source and\nexperimentally on the widely used MNIST dataset. The findings reveal that the\nRDC model exhibits desirable properties, including monotonic non-increasing and\nconvex functions, under certain conditions. This work provides insights into\nthe development of human-machine friendly compression methods and Video Coding\nfor Machine (VCM) approaches, paving the way for end-to-end image compression\ntechniques in real-world applications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yuefeng Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yuefeng Zhang", "id": "2405.03500v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03500v1", "repo": "null"}}

Different settings of the\nTCMNN algorithms' parameters were tested on medical data sets, in addition to\nthe use of different Minkowski metrics and polynomial kernels. The effect of\nincreasing the number of nearest neighbours and marking results with\nsignificance was also investigated. SVM implementation of the Transductive\nConfidence Machine was compared with Nearest Neighbours implementation. The\napplication of neural networks was investigated as a useful comparison to the\ntransductive algorithms.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u8f49\u5c0e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6a5f\u5668\u6700\u8fd1\u9130\u5c45 (TCMNN) \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u652f\u63f4\u6027\u7684\u7c21\u55ae\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4ecb\u9762\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u660e\u53ef\u592b\u65af\u57fa\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u6838\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u9084\u91dd\u5c0d\u91ab\u7642\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e86 TCMNN \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u53c3\u6578\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3002\u4e5f\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u589e\u52a0\u6700\u8fd1\u9130\u5c45\u6578\u76ee\u548c\u6a19\u8a18\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u8457\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5c07\u8f49\u5c0e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6a5f\u5668\u7684 SVM \u5be6\u4f5c\u8207\u6700\u8fd1\u9130\u5c45\u5be6\u4f5c\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u8f49\u5c0e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002", "author": "David Lindsay et.al.", "authors": "David Lindsay", "id": "2405.15988v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15988v1", "repo": "null"}}

In this year's edition, three tasks were proposed, where Task 2 was\nabout early detection of signs of anorexia. Early risk detection is a problem\nwhere precision and speed are two crucial objectives. Our research group solved\nTask 2 by defining a CPI+DMC approach, addressing both objectives\nindependently, and a time-aware approach, where precision and speed are\nconsidered a combined single-objective. We implemented the last approach by\nexplicitly integrating time during the learning process, considering the\nERDE{\\theta} metric as the training objective. It also allowed us to\nincorporate temporal metrics to validate and select the optimal models. We\nachieved outstanding results for the ERDE50 metric and ranking-based metrics,\ndemonstrating consistency in solving ERD problems.", "paper_summary_zh": "eRisk \u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u8207\u7db2\u8def\u65e9\u671f\u98a8\u96aa\u5075\u6e2c\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4efb\u52d9 2 \u662f\u95dc\u65bc\u65e9\u671f\u5075\u6e2c\u53ad\u98df\u75c7\u5fb5\u5146\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u98a8\u96aa\u5075\u6e2c\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7cbe\u6e96\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u5169\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u7d44\u900f\u904e\u5b9a\u7fa9 CPI+DMC \u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u4efb\u52d9 2\uff0c\u7368\u7acb\u8655\u7406\u9019\u5169\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7a2e\u6642\u9593\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7cbe\u6e96\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u55ae\u4e00\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u660e\u78ba\u6574\u5408\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07 ERDE{\\theta} \u6307\u6a19\u8996\u70ba\u8a13\u7df4\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u4f86\u5be6\u4f5c\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u4e5f\u5141\u8a31\u6211\u5011\u7d0d\u5165\u6642\u9593\u6307\u6a19\u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u548c\u9078\u64c7\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 ERDE50 \u6307\u6a19\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u6392\u540d\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u5091\u51fa\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a ERD \u554f\u984c\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "author": "Horacio Thompson et.al.", "authors": "Horacio Thompson, Marcelo Errecalde", "id": "2410.17963v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17963v1", "repo": "null"}}

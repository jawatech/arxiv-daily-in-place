Previous research has developed systems for detecting applicable ICD\ncodes that should be assigned while writing a given EHR document, mainly\nfocusing on discharge summaries written at the end of a hospital stay. In this\nwork, we investigate the potential of predicting these codes for the whole\npatient stay at different time points during their stay, even before they are\nofficially assigned by clinicians. The development of methods to predict\ndiagnoses and treatments earlier in advance could open opportunities for\npredictive medicine, such as identifying disease risks sooner, suggesting\ntreatments, and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments show that\npredictions regarding final ICD codes can be made already two days after\nadmission and we propose a custom model that improves performance on this early\nprediction task.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8a18\u9304 (EHR) \u662f\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u75c5\u4eba\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u91ab\u7642\u75c5\u53f2\u3001\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5075\u6e2c\u5728\u64b0\u5beb\u7279\u5b9a EHR \u6587\u4ef6\u6642\u61c9\u6307\u6d3e\u7684\u9069\u7528\u7684 ICD \u4ee3\u78bc\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u5728\u91ab\u9662\u505c\u7559\u7d50\u675f\u6642\u64b0\u5beb\u7684\u51fa\u9662\u6458\u8981\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u9810\u6e2c\u9019\u4e9b\u4ee3\u78bc\u5728\u75c5\u4eba\u505c\u7559\u671f\u9593\u4e0d\u540c\u6642\u9593\u9ede\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u751f\u6b63\u5f0f\u6307\u6d3e\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\u958b\u767c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u8a3a\u65b7\u548c\u6cbb\u7642\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u70ba\u9810\u6e2c\u91ab\u5b78\u958b\u555f\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u53ca\u65e9\u8b58\u5225\u75be\u75c5\u98a8\u96aa\u3001\u5efa\u8b70\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u8cc7\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u95dc\u65bc\u6700\u7d42 ICD \u4ee3\u78bc\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5165\u9662\u5f8c\u5169\u5929\u9032\u884c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u8a02\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6b64\u65e9\u671f\u9810\u6e2c\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Mireia Hernandez Caralt et.al.", "authors": "Mireia Hernandez Caralt, Clarence Boon Liang Ng, Marek Rei", "id": "2405.11622v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11622v1", "repo": "null"}}

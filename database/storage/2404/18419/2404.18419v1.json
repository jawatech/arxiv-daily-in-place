Then a set of dual-mode\nhumidity medical image library suitable for deep network is established, and a\ndual-mode medical image assisted diagnosis method based on the image is\nproposed. Through the test of various feature extraction methods, the optimal\noperating characteristic under curve product (AUROC) is 0.9985, the recall rate\nis 0.9814, and the accuracy is 0.9833. This method can be applied to clinical\ndiagnosis, and it is a practical method. Any outpatient doctor can register\nquickly through the system, or log in to the platform to upload the image to\nobtain more accurate images. Through the system, each outpatient physician can\nquickly register or log in to the platform for image uploading, thus obtaining\nmore accurate images. The segmentation of images can guide doctors in clinical\ndepartments. Then the image is analyzed to determine the location and nature of\nthe tumor, so as to make targeted treatment.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jiajie Yuan et.al.", "authors": "Jiajie Yuan,Linxiao Wu,Yulu Gong,Zhou Yu,Ziang Liu,Shuyao He", "id": "2404.18419v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18419v1", "repo": "null"}}

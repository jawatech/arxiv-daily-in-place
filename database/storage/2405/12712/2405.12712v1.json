These interactions have different\nproperties and flow differently based on what goal the developer wants to\nachieve and who they interact with. In this paper, we aim to understand the\ndynamics of conversations that occur during modern software development after\nthe integration of AI and chatbots, enabling a deeper recognition of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of including chatbot interactions in addition to\nhuman conversations in collaborative work. We compile existing conversation\nattributes with humans and NLU-based chatbots and adapt them to the context of\nsoftware development. Then, we extend the comparison to include LLM-powered\nchatbots based on an observational study. We present similarities and\ndifferences between human-to-human and human-to-bot conversations, also\ndistinguishing between NLU- and LLM-based chatbots. Furthermore, we discuss how\nunderstanding the differences among the conversation styles guides the\ndeveloper on how to shape their expectations from a conversation and\nconsequently support the communication within a software team. We conclude that\nthe recent conversation styles that we observe with LLM-chatbots can not\nreplace conversations with humans due to certain attributes regarding social\naspects despite their ability to support productivity and decrease the\ndevelopers' mental load.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8edf\u9ad4\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u4e0d\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5e38\u8207\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u4e92\u52d5\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6839\u64da\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u60f3\u8981\u9054\u6210\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u548c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u5c0d\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u5728\u6574\u5408 AI \u548c\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5f8c\uff0c\u73fe\u4ee3\u8edf\u9ad4\u958b\u767c\u4e2d\u767c\u751f\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u4e86\u89e3\u5728\u5354\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u512a\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7de8\u8b6f\u4e86\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u548c\u57fa\u65bc NLU \u7684\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u5c0d\u8a71\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u8abf\u6574\u5230\u8edf\u9ad4\u958b\u767c\u7684\u8108\u7d61\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u89c0\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c07\u6bd4\u8f03\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u62ec\u7531 LLM \u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5448\u73fe\u4eba\u5c0d\u4eba\u8207\u4eba\u5c0d\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u5c0d\u8a71\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u4e5f\u5340\u5206\u57fa\u65bc NLU \u548c LLM \u7684\u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\u4e86\u89e3\u5c0d\u8a71\u98a8\u683c\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u5f15\u5c0e\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d\u5c0d\u8a71\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4e26\u56e0\u6b64\u652f\u63f4\u8edf\u9ad4\u5718\u968a\u5167\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728 LLM \u804a\u5929\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5c0d\u8a71\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u652f\u63f4\u751f\u7522\u529b\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u5fc3\u7406\u8ca0\u64d4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u67d0\u4e9b\u95dc\u65bc\u793e\u4ea4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u53d6\u4ee3\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u3002", "author": "Ranim Khojah et.al.", "authors": "Ranim Khojah, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto, Philipp Leitner", "id": "2405.12712v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12712v1", "repo": "null"}}

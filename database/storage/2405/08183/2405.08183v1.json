As a result, due to various kinds of differences among devices, it\nis hard for existing FL methods to conduct training effectively in\nenergy-constrained scenarios, such as the battery constraints of devices. To\ntackle the above issues, we propose an energy-aware FL framework named DR-FL,\nwhich considers the energy constraints in both clients and heterogeneous deep\nlearning models to enable energy-efficient FL. Unlike Vanilla FL, DR-FL adopts\nour proposed Muti-Agents Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based dual-selection\nmethod, which allows participated devices to make contributions to the global\nmodel effectively and adaptively based on their computing capabilities and\nenergy capacities in a MARL-based manner. Experiments on various well-known\ndatasets show that DR-FL can not only maximise knowledge sharing among\nheterogeneous models under the energy constraint of large-scale AIoT systems\nbut also improve the model performance of each involved heterogeneous device.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u806f\u5408\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2 (FL) \u5728\u7570\u8cea\u5316\u7269\u806f\u7db2 (AIoT) \u88dd\u7f6e\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5171\u4eab\u4e2d\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u540c\u8cea\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u8207\u7570\u8cea\u5316\u88dd\u7f6e\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6240\u9020\u6210\u7684\u300c\u6728\u6876\u6548\u61c9\u300d\uff0c\u5176\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u7684\u96fb\u6c60\u9a45\u52d5\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u56b4\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e4b\u9593\u5404\u7a2e\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684 FL \u65b9\u6cd5\u96e3\u4ee5\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u88dd\u7f6e\u7684\u96fb\u6c60\u9650\u5236\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e0a\u8ff0\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba DR-FL \u7684\u7bc0\u80fd FL \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5b83\u8003\u616e\u4e86\u7528\u6236\u7aef\u548c\u7570\u8cea\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u7bc0\u80fd FL\u3002\u8207 Vanilla FL \u4e0d\u540c\uff0cDR-FL \u63a1\u7528\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (MARL) \u57fa\u65bc\u96d9\u91cd\u9078\u64c7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8a31\u53c3\u8207\u7684\u88dd\u7f6e\u6839\u64da\u5176\u904b\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ee5 MARL \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u5730\u5c0d\u5168\u7403\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u51fa\u8ca2\u737b\u3002\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u77e5\u540d\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0cDR-FL \u4e0d\u50c5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u898f\u6a21 AIoT \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7570\u8cea\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u9084\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6bcf\u500b\u53c3\u8207\u7684\u7570\u8cea\u5316\u88dd\u7f6e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Jun Xia et.al.", "authors": "Jun Xia, Yiyu Shi", "id": "2405.08183v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08183v1", "repo": "null"}}

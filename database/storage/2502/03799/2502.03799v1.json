Effectively detecting hallucinations is\ntherefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked\nhallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be\ndetected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set\nof samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens\ndefined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue\nthat it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show\nthat detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model\nuncertainty in the Bayesian sense. To this end, we propose a very simple and\nefficient approach that perturbs an appropriate subset of model parameters, or\nequivalently hidden unit activations, during sampling. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness across a wide range of datasets and model architectures.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5bb9\u6613\u7522\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u932f\u8aa4\u7684\u56de\u61c9\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u5e7b\u89ba\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5075\u6e2c\u5e7b\u89ba\u5c0d\u65bc LLM \u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u5c07\u5e7b\u89ba\u8207\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u9023\u7d50\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u5e7b\u89ba\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u6e2c\u91cf\u5f9e\u6a21\u578b\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u4e00\u7d44\u6a23\u672c\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u4f48\u4e2d\u7684\u96e2\u6563\u5ea6\u4f86\u5075\u6e2c\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5f9e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u7b26\u865f\u5206\u4f48\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u662f\u53d6\u5f97\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e3b\u5f35\u9019\u5c0d\u65bc\u5075\u6e2c\u5e7b\u89ba\u4f86\u8aaa\u4e26\u975e\u6700\u4f73\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u8003\u91cf\u8c9d\u6c0f\u610f\u7fa9\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u986f\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5075\u6e2c\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u975e\u5e38\u7c21\u55ae\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53d6\u6a23\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u64fe\u52d5\u6a21\u578b\u53c3\u6578\u6216\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u96b1\u85cf\u55ae\u5143\u6d3b\u5316\u7684\u9069\u7576\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u69cb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "author": "Litian Liu et.al.", "authors": "Litian Liu, Reza Pourreza, Sunny Panchal, Apratim Bhattacharyya, Yao Qin, Roland Memisevic", "id": "2502.03799v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03799v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, for\nobtaining this relation, the ABA framework needs to be restricted to being\nflat, i.e., a fragment where the (defeasible) assumptions can never be\nentailed, only assumed to be true or false. Here, we remove this restriction\nand show a correspondence between non-flat ABA and LPs with negation as failure\nin their head. We then extend this result to so-called set-stable ABA\nsemantics, originally defined for the fragment of non-flat ABA called bipolar\nABA. We showcase how to define set-stable semantics for LPs with negation as\nfailure in their head and show the correspondence to set-stable ABA semantics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\uff08\u7247\u6bb5\u5f0f\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u8bba\u8bc1\uff08ABA\uff09\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08LP\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cABA \u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\uff08\u53ef\u53cd\u9a73\u7684\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u88ab\u5047\u5b9a\u4e3a\u771f\u6216\u5047\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u79fb\u9664\u4e86\u6b64\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u6241\u5e73 ABA \u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u5373\u5931\u8d25\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u5934\u90e8\u7684 LP \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a ABA \u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u975e\u6241\u5e73 ABA \u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u53cc\u6781 ABA\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u5426\u5b9a\u5373\u5931\u8d25\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u5934\u90e8\u7684 LP \u5b9a\u4e49\u96c6\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u96c6\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a ABA \u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "author": "Anna Rapberger et.al.", "authors": "Anna Rapberger, Markus Ulbricht, Francesca Toni", "id": "2405.09415v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09415v1", "repo": "null"}}

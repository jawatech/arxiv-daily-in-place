In\nthis survey paper, we investigate how generative artificial intelligence (AI),\nwhich saw a significant increase in interest in the mid-2010s, is being used\nfor PCG. We review applications of generative AI for the creation of various\ntypes of content, including terrains, items, and even storylines. While\ngenerative AI is effective for PCG, one significant issues it faces is that\nbuilding high-performance generative AI requires vast amounts of training data.\nBecause content generally highly customized, domain-specific training data is\nscarce, and straightforward approaches to generative AI models may not work\nwell. For PCG research to advance further, issues related to limited training\ndata must be overcome. Thus, we also give special consideration to research\nthat addresses the challenges posed by limited training data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u904e\u53bb\u66fe\u5617\u8a66\u5728 PCG \u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u5728\n\u9019\u7bc7\u8abf\u67e5\u5831\u544a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\nPCG\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5728 2010 \u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u671f\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u6975\u5927\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u4e86\n\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5167\u5bb9\u5275\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u5f62\u3001\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u7bc0\u3002\u96d6\u7136\n\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5c0d\u65bc PCG \u4f86\u8aaa\u5f88\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u9762\u81e8\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u5927\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\n\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5167\u5bb9\u901a\u5e38\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5ba2\u88fd\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u5f88\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u7121\u6cd5\n\u767c\u63ee\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u82e5\u8981\u8b93 PCG \u7814\u7a76\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u5fc5\u9808\u514b\u670d\u8207\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u9650\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u7279\u5225\u8003\u91cf\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u9650\u6240\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u6311\u6230\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "author": "Xinyu Mao et.al.", "authors": "Xinyu Mao, Wanli Yu, Kazunori D Yamada, Michael R.

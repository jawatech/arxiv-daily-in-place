While prior eye-tracking\nstudies have trained models to recognize reading behaviors, they often rely on\ninstructed reading tasks, which can alter natural behaviors and limit the\napplicability of these findings to in-the-wild settings. Additionally, there is\na lack of clear definitions for reading behavior archetypes in the literature.\nWe conducted a classroom study to address these issues by collecting instructed\nand in-the-wild reading data. We developed a mixed-method framework, including\na human-driven theoretical model, statistical analyses, and an AI classifier,\nto differentiate reading behaviors based on their velocity, density, and\nsequentiality. Our lightweight 2D CNN achieved an F1 score of 0.8 for behavior\nrecognition, providing a robust approach for understanding in-the-wild reading.\nThis work advances our ability to provide detailed behavioral insights to\neducators, supporting more targeted and effective assessment and instruction.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e86\u89e3\u8b80\u8005\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u700f\u89bd\u3001\u6df1\u5c64\u95b1\u8b80\u548c\u6383\u63cf\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u6539\u5584\u6559\u80b2\u6559\u5b78\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5148\u524d\u7684\u773c\u7403\u8ffd\u8e64\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u8b58\u5225\u95b1\u8b80\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u6307\u793a\u6027\u95b1\u8b80\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u6539\u8b8a\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u70ba\u4e26\u9650\u5236\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u5c0d\u91ce\u5916\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u9069\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0d\u95b1\u8b80\u884c\u70ba\u539f\u578b\u660e\u78ba\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u8ab2\u5802\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u6536\u96c6\u6307\u793a\u6027\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u95b1\u8b80\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u70ba\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7d71\u8a08\u5206\u6790\u548c AI \u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9806\u5e8f\u6027\u4f86\u5340\u5206\u95b1\u8b80\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8f15\u91cf\u7d1a 2D CNN \u5728\u884c\u70ba\u8b58\u5225\u65b9\u9762\u9054\u5230\u4e86 0.8 \u7684 F1 \u5206\u6578\uff0c\u70ba\u7406\u89e3\u91ce\u5916\u95b1\u8b80\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u5411\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u8a73\u7d30\u884c\u70ba\u898b\u89e3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u63f4\u66f4\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6559\u5b78\u3002", "author": "Eduardo Davalos et.al.", "authors": "Eduardo Davalos, Jorge Alberto Salas, Yike Zhang, Namrata Srivastava, Yashvitha Thatigotla, Abbey Gonzales, Sara McFadden, Sun-Joo Cho, Gautam Biswas, Amanda Goodwin", "id": "2501.18468v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18468v1", "repo": "null"}}

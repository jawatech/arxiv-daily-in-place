Despite\nglobal significance, research has primarily focused on understanding the\nperspectives and experiences of US and India crowdworkers, leaving a notable\ngap. To bridge this, we conducted a survey with 100 crowdworkers across 16\nLatin American and Caribbean countries. We discovered that these workers\nexhibited pride and respect for their digital labor, with strong support and\nadmiration from their families. Notably, crowd work was also seen as a stepping\nstone to financial and professional independence. Surprisingly, despite wanting\nmore connection, these workers also felt isolated from peers and doubtful of\nothers' labor quality. They resisted collaboration and gender-based tools,\nvaluing gender-neutrality. Our work advances HCI understanding of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean crowdwork, offering insights for digital resistance\ntools for the region.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5168\u7403 AI \u7684\u6fc0\u589e\u9700\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u3002\n\u4ed6\u5011\u5728\u6a19\u8a18\u6578\u64da\u4ee5\u555f\u7528\u5168\u7403 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u65b9\u9762\u767c\u63ee\u8457\u95dc\u9375\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\n\u5177\u6709\u5168\u7403\u610f\u7fa9\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u65bc\u4e86\u89e3\u7f8e\u570b\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u548c\u7d93\u9a57\uff0c\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\n\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5f4c\u5408\u9019\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d 16 \u500b\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u548c\u52a0\u52d2\u6bd4\u570b\u5bb6\u7684 100 \u540d\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u4eba\n\u5c0d\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u6578\u4f4d\u52de\u52d5\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u81ea\u8c6a\u548c\u5c0a\u91cd\uff0c\u4e26\u5f97\u5230\u5bb6\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u529b\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8b9a\u8cde\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e5f\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u9081\u5411\u8ca1\u52d9\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u7368\u7acb\u7684\u8e0f\u8173\u77f3\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u60f3\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u806f\u7e6b\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u4eba\u4e5f\u611f\u5230\u8207\u540c\u5115\u9694\u96e2\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u52de\u52d5\u54c1\u8cea\u611f\u5230\u61f7\u7591\u3002\u4ed6\u5011\u62b5\u5236\u5354\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u6027\u5225\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91cd\u8996\u6027\u5225\u4e2d\u7acb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u52d5\u4e86 HCI \u5c0d\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u548c\u52a0\u52d2\u6bd4\u6d77\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u70ba\u8a72\u5730\u5340\u7684\u6578\u4f4d\u62b5\u6297\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u898b\u89e3\u3002", "author": "Gianna Williams et.al.", "authors": "Gianna Williams, Maya De Los Santos, Alexandra To, Saiph Savage", "id": "2501.06981v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06981v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, it has been shown that there is a length\nbias in evaluation of such models, and that training algorithms tend to exploit\nthis bias by learning longer responses. In this work we show how to train\nmodels that can be controlled at inference time with instructions containing\ndesired length constraints. Such models are superior in length instructed\nevaluations, outperforming standard instruction following models such as GPT4,\nLlama 3 and Mixtral.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u9f4a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5176\u672a\u5c0d\u9f4a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6eff\u8db3\u7528\u6236\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u9577\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8a13\u7df4\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6703\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b78\u7fd2\u66f4\u9577\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u6240\u9700\u9577\u5ea6\u7d04\u675f\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9032\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9577\u5ea6\u6307\u5c0e\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u512a\u7570\uff0c\u512a\u65bc GPT4\u3001Llama 3 \u548c Mixtral \u7b49\u6a19\u6e96\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Weizhe Yuan et.al.", "authors": "Weizhe Yuan, Ilia Kulikov, Ping Yu, Kyunghyun Cho, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Jing Xu", "id": "2406.17744v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17744v1", "repo": "null"}}

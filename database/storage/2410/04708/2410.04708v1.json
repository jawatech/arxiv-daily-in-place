In this work, we rigorously analyze the\nstability, robustness, and convergence of PC through the lens of dynamical\nsystems theory. We show that, first, PC is Lyapunov stable under mild\nassumptions on its loss and residual energy functions, which implies intrinsic\nrobustness to small random perturbations due to its well-defined\nenergy-minimizing dynamics. Second, we formally establish that the PC updates\napproximate quasi-Newton methods by incorporating higher-order curvature\ninformation, which makes them more stable and able to converge with fewer\niterations compared to models trained via backpropagation (BP). Furthermore,\nusing this dynamical framework, we provide new theoretical bounds on the\nsimilarity between PC and other algorithms, i.e., BP and target propagation\n(TP), by precisely characterizing the role of higher-order derivatives. These\nbounds, derived through detailed analysis of the Hessian structures, show that\nPC is significantly closer to quasi-Newton updates than TP, providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the stability and efficiency of PC compared to conventional\nlearning methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u57fa\u65bc\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9810\u6e2c\u7de8\u78bc (PC)\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u7406\u8ad6\u6027\u8cea\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5c40\u90e8\u904b\u7b97\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b78\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8aa4\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u6a5f\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u793e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u95dc\u6ce8\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u52d5\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\uff0c\u56b4\u8b39\u5206\u6790 PC \u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6536\u6582\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5c0d\u5176\u640d\u5931\u548c\u6b98\u5dee\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u6eab\u548c\u5047\u8a2d\u4e0b\uff0cPC \u662f Lyapunov \u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u5b9a\u7fa9\u826f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u5c0d\u5c0f\u578b\u96a8\u6a5f\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u5167\u5728\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6b63\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb PC \u66f4\u65b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6e96\u725b\u9813\u6cd5\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7d0d\u5165\u9ad8\u968e\u66f2\u7387\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u5011\u66f4\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u80fd\u5920\u8207\u900f\u904e\u53cd\u5411\u50b3\u64ad (BP) \u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53cd\u8986\u904b\u7b97\u4f86\u6536\u6582\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u500b\u52d5\u614b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 PC \u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5373 BP \u548c\u76ee\u6a19\u50b3\u64ad (TP)\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8ad6\u754c\u7dda\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7cbe\u78ba\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ad8\u968e\u5c0e\u6578\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u754c\u7dda\u662f\u900f\u904e\u5c0d\u6d77\u68ee\u7d50\u69cb\u7684\u8a73\u7d30\u5206\u6790\u6240\u884d\u751f\uff0c\u986f\u793a PC \u660e\u986f\u6bd4 TP \u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6e96\u725b\u9813\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9019\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c0d PC \u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u3002", "author": "Ankur Mali et.al.", "authors": "Ankur Mali, Tommaso Salvatori, Alexander Ororbia", "id": "2410.04708v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04708v1", "repo": "null"}}

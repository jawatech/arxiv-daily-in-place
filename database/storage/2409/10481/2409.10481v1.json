These assumptions limit their use\nwhen acquisition conditions, such as the subject's distance from the camera or\nthe camera's characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens\nin video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies\nto address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical\nmodel fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we\nexplore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,\nemploying each one as the template set generator for a face verification\nsystem. The scores provided by each system are combined by score-level fusion.\nWe show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves\nperformance when tests are conducted at never-seen-before distances from the\ncamera and camera characteristics (cross-distance and cross-camera settings),\nthus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR-based approaches.", "paper_summary_zh": "3D \u4eba\u81c9\u91cd\u5efa (3DFR) \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u65bc\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u5834\u666f\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u5047\u8a2d\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7576\u64f7\u53d6\u689d\u4ef6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4e3b\u9ad4\u8207\u76f8\u6a5f\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u6216\u76f8\u6a5f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff09\u8207\u9810\u671f\u4e0d\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u8996\u8a0a\u76e3\u63a7\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u767c\u751f\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c3DFR \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a1\u7528\u5404\u7a2e\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5f9e 2D \u8cc7\u6599\u91cd\u5efa 3D \u5f62\u72c0\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7d71\u8a08\u6a21\u578b\u64ec\u5408\u3001\u5149\u5ea6\u7acb\u9ad4\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u4e09\u7a2e\u4ee3\u8868 SOTA \u7684 3DFR \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6bcf\u7a2e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4f5c\u4eba\u81c9\u9a57\u8b49\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7bc4\u672c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7522\u751f\u5668\u3002\u6bcf\u500b\u7cfb\u7d71\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5206\u6578\u6703\u900f\u904e\u5206\u6578\u5c64\u7d1a\u878d\u5408\u7d50\u5408\u3002\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\u7531\u4e0d\u540c 3DFR \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f15\u767c\u7684\u4e92\u88dc\u6027\u5728\u5f9e\u672a\u898b\u904e\u7684\u76f8\u6a5f\u8ddd\u96e2\u548c\u76f8\u6a5f\u7279\u6027\uff08\u8de8\u8ddd\u96e2\u548c\u8de8\u76f8\u6a5f\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff09\u9032\u884c\u6e2c\u8a66\u6642\u6703\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9f13\u52f5\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u65bc\u591a\u91cd 3DFR \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Simone Maurizio La Cava et.al.", "authors": "Simone Maurizio La Cava, Sara Concas, Ruben Tolosana, Roberto Casula, Giulia Orr\u00f9, Martin Drahansky, Julian Fierrez, Gian Luca Marcialis", "id": "2409.10481v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1", "repo": "null"}}

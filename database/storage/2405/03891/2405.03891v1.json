A comprehensive modeling of the security threats\nand the demonstration of adversarial attacks and defenses on practical AI based\nO-RAN systems is still in its nascent stages. We begin by conducting threat\nmodeling to pinpoint attack surfaces in O-RAN using an ML-based Connection\nmanagement application (xApp) as an example. The xApp uses a Graph Neural\nNetwork trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning and achieves on average 54%\nimprovement in the coverage rate measured as the 5th percentile user data\nrates. We then formulate and demonstrate evasion attacks that degrade the\ncoverage rates by as much as 50% through injecting bounded noise at different\nthreat surfaces including the open wireless medium itself. Crucially, we also\ncompare and contrast the effectiveness of such attacks on the ML-based xApp and\na non-ML based heuristic. We finally develop and demonstrate robust\ntraining-based defenses against the challenging physical/jamming-based attacks\nand show a 15% improvement in the coverage rates when compared to employing no\ndefense over a range of noise budgets", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u6297\u5f0f\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u7a2e\u653b\u64ca\u548c\u9632\u79a6\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96a8\u8457 ML \u6108\u4f86\u6108\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u7121\u7dda\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u7121\u7dda\u63a5\u53d6\u7db2\u8def (O-RAN)\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e5f\u8fc5\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u8105\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u57fa\u65bc AI \u7684\u5be6\u969b O-RAN \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u5c0d\u6297\u5f0f\u653b\u64ca\u548c\u9632\u79a6\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u8655\u65bc\u840c\u82bd\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5148\u9032\u884c\u5a01\u8105\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u627e\u51fa O-RAN \u4e2d\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u9762\uff0c\u4e26\u4ee5\u57fa\u65bc ML \u7684\u9023\u7dda\u7ba1\u7406\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f (xApp) \u70ba\u4f8b\u3002xApp \u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u4e26\u5e73\u5747\u5c07\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8cc7\u6599\u901f\u7387\u7b2c 5 \u500b\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6578\u6e2c\u91cf\u7684\u8986\u84cb\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 54%\u3002\u63a5\u8457\u6211\u5011\u5236\u5b9a\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u898f\u907f\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u7121\u7dda\u5a92\u9ad4\u672c\u8eab\u5728\u5167\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u8105\u9762\u4e0a\u6ce8\u5165\u6709\u754c\u96dc\u8a0a\uff0c\u5c07\u8986\u84cb\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u9054 50%\u3002\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e26\u5c0d\u6bd4\u6b64\u985e\u653b\u64ca\u5728\u57fa\u65bc ML \u7684 xApp \u548c\u975e\u57fa\u65bc ML \u7684\u555f\u767c\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u91dd\u5c0d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406/\u5e72\u64fe\u5f0f\u653b\u64ca\u958b\u767c\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u5f37\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u9632\u79a6\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u96dc\u8a0a\u9810\u7b97\u4e0b\u8207\u4e0d\u63a1\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u8986\u84cb\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 15%\u3002", "author": "Ravikumar Balakrishnan et.al.", "authors": "Ravikumar Balakrishnan, Marius Arvinte, Nageen Himayat, Hosein Nikopour, Hassnaa Moustafa", "id": "2405.03891v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03891v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, when quantized\ninto low-bit representations, there is often a significant performance drop\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts. To address this issue,\nreconstruction methods have been incorporated into the PTQ framework to improve\nperformance in low-bit quantization settings. Nevertheless, existing related\nmethods predefine the reconstruction granularity and seldom explore the\nprogressive relationships between different reconstruction granularities, which\nleads to sub-optimal quantization results in ViTs. To this end, in this paper,\nwe propose a Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction (PFCR) method for\naccurate PTQ, which significantly improves the performance of low-bit quantized\nvision transformers. Specifically, we define multi-head self-attention and\nmulti-layer perceptron modules along with their shortcuts as the finest\nreconstruction units. After reconstructing these two fine-grained units, we\ncombine them to form coarser blocks and reconstruct them at a coarser\ngranularity level. We iteratively perform this combination and reconstruction\nprocess, achieving progressive fine-to-coarse reconstruction. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Progressive Optimization Strategy (POS) for PFCR to alleviate the\ndifficulty of training, thereby further enhancing model performance.\nExperimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod achieves the best Top-1 accuracy among state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly attaining 75.61% for 3-bit quantized ViT-B in PTQ. Besides,\nquantization results on the COCO dataset reveal the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of our proposed method on other computer vision tasks like\nobject detection and instance segmentation.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u5f8c\u91cf\u5316 (PTQ) \u5df2\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a1\u7528\u65bc\u58d3\u7e2e\u8996\u89baTransformer (ViT)\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u91cf\u5316\u70ba\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5143\u8868\u793a\u6642\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5c0d\u61c9\u9805\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u51fa\u73fe\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u7d0d\u5165 PTQ \u67b6\u69cb\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u65b9\u6cd5\u9810\u5148\u5b9a\u7fa9\u91cd\u5efa\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e0d\u540c\u91cd\u5efa\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u6f38\u9032\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4 ViT \u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7d50\u679c\u6b21\u4f73\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u6f38\u9032\u7cbe\u7d30\u5230\u7c97\u7565\u91cd\u5efa (PFCR) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6e96\u78ba\u7684 PTQ\uff0c\u9019\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u8996\u89baTransformer\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u591a\u982d\u81ea\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u548c\u591a\u5c64\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u6a21\u7d44\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u6377\u5f91\u70ba\u6700\u7cbe\u7d30\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u55ae\u5143\u3002\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u9019\u5169\u500b\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u55ae\u5143\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u7d44\u5408\u8d77\u4f86\u5f62\u6210\u8f03\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u5340\u584a\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u8f03\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c64\u7d1a\u91cd\u5efa\u5b83\u5011\u3002\u6211\u5011\u53cd\u8986\u57f7\u884c\u6b64\u7d44\u5408\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u6f38\u9032\u7684\u7cbe\u7d30\u5230\u7c97\u7565\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u70ba PFCR \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6f38\u9032\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u7b56\u7565 (POS)\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e1b\u8f15\u8a13\u7df4\u96e3\u5ea6\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728 ImageNet \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684 Top-1 \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728 PTQ \u4e2d\u70ba 3 \u4f4d\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u7684 ViT-B \u9054\u5230\u4e86 75.61%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728 COCO \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7d50\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u96fb\u8166\u8996\u89ba\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4ef6\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u5be6\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Rui Ding et.al.", "authors": "Rui Ding, Liang Yong, Sihuan Zhao, Jing Nie, Lihui Chen, Haijun Liu, Xichuan Zhou", "id": "2412.14633v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14633v1", "repo": "null"}}

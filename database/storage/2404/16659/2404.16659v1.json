One notable challenge in such applications is\ndiscerning unanswerable queries. Through fine-tuning model, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of converting medical record inquiries into SQL queries.\nAdditionally, we introduce an entropy-based method to identify and filter out\nunanswerable results. We further enhance result quality by filtering\nlow-confidence SQL through log probability-based distribution, while\ngrammatical and schema errors are mitigated by executing queries on the actual\ndatabase. We experimentally verified that our method can filter unanswerable\nquestions, which can be widely utilized even when the parameters of the model\nare not accessible, and that it can be effectively utilized in practice.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Sangryul Kim et.al.", "authors": "Sangryul Kim,Donghee Han,Sehyun Kim", "id": "2404.16659v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16659v1", "repo": "https://github.com/venzino-han/probgate_ehrsql"}}

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Composition to Augment\nLanguage Models (CALM) in adapting to the financial domain. CALM is a model to\nextend the capabilities of existing models by introducing cross-attention\nbetween two LLMs with different functions. In our experiments, we developed a\nCALM to enhance the financial performance of an LLM with strong response\ncapabilities by leveraging a financial-specialized LLM. Notably, the CALM was\ntrained using a financial dataset different from the one used to train the\nfinancial-specialized LLM, confirming CALM's ability to adapt to various\ndatasets. The models were evaluated through quantitative Japanese financial\nbenchmarks and qualitative response comparisons, demonstrating that CALM\nenables superior responses with higher scores than the original models and\nbaselines. Additionally, comparative experiments on connection points revealed\nthat connecting the middle layers of the models is most effective in\nfacilitating adaptation to the financial domain. These findings confirm that\nCALM is a practical approach for adapting LLMs to the financial domain.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9818\u57df\u9069\u61c9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u7e8c\u64f4\u5c55\u800c\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Composition to Augment Language Models (CALM) \u5728\u9069\u61c9\u91d1\u878d\u9818\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002CALM \u662f\u4e00\u500b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5169\u500b LLM \u4e4b\u9593\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f86\u64f4\u5c55\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b CALM\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u500b\u8ca1\u52d9\u5c08\u696d\u7684 LLM \u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u5177\u6709\u5f37\u5927\u56de\u61c9\u80fd\u529b\u7684 LLM \u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0cCALM \u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8207\u8a13\u7df4\u8ca1\u52d9\u5c08\u696d LLM \u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u8b49\u5be6\u4e86 CALM \u9069\u61c9\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u65e5\u6587\u8ca1\u52d9\u57fa\u6e96\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u6bd4\u8f03\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8b49\u660e CALM \u80fd\u5920\u7522\u751f\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7dda\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u6578\u7684\u512a\u7570\u56de\u61c9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c0d\u9023\u63a5\u9ede\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u9023\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u9593\u5c64\u5728\u4fc3\u9032\u9069\u61c9\u91d1\u878d\u9818\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u8b49\u5be6 CALM \u662f\u5c07 LLM \u9069\u61c9\u5230\u91d1\u878d\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Kota Tanabe et.al.", "authors": "Kota Tanabe, Masanori Hirano, Kazuki Matoya, Kentaro Imajo, Hiroki Sakaji, Itsuki Noda", "id": "2411.09249v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09249v1", "repo": "null"}}

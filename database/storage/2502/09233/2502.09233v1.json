While machine learning approaches, such as deep\nlearning, are extremely effective at tasks that involve observation and\nclassification, they struggle when it comes to performing higher level\nreasoning about situations on the road. This research involves incorporating\ncommonsense reasoning models that use image data to improve AV systems. This\nwill allow AV systems to perform more accurate reasoning while also making them\nmore adjustable, explainable, and ethical. This paper will discuss the findings\nso far and motivate its direction going forward.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u8eca\u8f1b (AV) \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u958b\u767c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\uff09\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u89c0\u5bdf\u548c\u5206\u985e\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5c0d\u8def\u6cc1\u9032\u884c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c64\u7d1a\u63a8\u7406\u6642\u6703\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6d89\u53ca\u6574\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u5e38\u8b58\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584 AV \u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u9019\u5c07\u4f7f AV \u7cfb\u7d71\u80fd\u5920\u57f7\u884c\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u8b93\u5b83\u5011\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u8abf\u6574\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c07\u63a2\u8a0e\u8fc4\u4eca\u70ba\u6b62\u7684\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u4e26\u8aaa\u660e\u5176\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Keegan Kimbrell et.al.", "authors": "Keegan Kimbrell", "id": "2502.09233v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09233v1", "repo": "null"}}

Despite its\neconomic relevance, this trend largely overlooked the issue of credit card\nfraud detection. To address this gap, we propose a new threat model that\ndemonstrates the limitations of existing attacks and highlights the necessity\nto investigate new approaches. We then design a new adversarial attack for\ncredit card fraud detection, employing reinforcement learning to bypass\nclassifiers. This attack, called FRAUD-RLA, is designed to maximize the\nattacker's reward by optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and\nworking with significantly less required knowledge than competitors. Our\nexperiments, conducted on three different heterogeneous datasets and against\ntwo fraud detection systems, indicate that FRAUD-RLA is effective, even\nconsidering the severe limitations imposed by our threat model.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u7cfb\u7d71\u69cb\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5df2\u6295\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u8cc7\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u5011\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5176\u7d93\u6fdf\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u8da8\u52e2\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ffd\u8996\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u8a50\u6b3a\u5075\u6e2c\u554f\u984c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u5a01\u8105\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u73fe\u6709\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u8abf\u67e5\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u8a50\u6b3a\u5075\u6e2c\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u7e5e\u904e\u5206\u985e\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u653b\u64ca\u7a31\u70ba FRAUD-RLA\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u900f\u904e\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u63a2\u7d22-\u958b\u767c\u6b0a\u8861\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u7af6\u722d\u5c0d\u624b\u6240\u9700\u77e5\u8b58\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f86\u6700\u5927\u5316\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u7684\u56de\u5831\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u5728\u4e09\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7570\u8cea\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u5169\u500b\u8a50\u6b3a\u5075\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e FRAUD-RLA \u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8003\u616e\u5230\u5a01\u8105\u6a21\u578b\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u56b4\u683c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "author": "Daniele Lunghi et.al.", "authors": "Daniele Lunghi, Yannick Molinghen, Alkis Simitsis, Tom Lenaerts, Gianluca Bontempi", "id": "2502.02290v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02290v1", "repo": "null"}}

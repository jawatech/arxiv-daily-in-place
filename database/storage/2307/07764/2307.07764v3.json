In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to XAI that uses the so-called\ncounterfactual paths generated by conditional permutations of features. The\nalgorithm measures feature importance by identifying sequential permutations of\nfeatures that most influence changes in model predictions. It is particularly\nsuitable for generating explanations based on counterfactual paths in knowledge\ngraphs incorporating domain knowledge. Counterfactual paths introduce an\nadditional graph dimension to current XAI methods in both explaining and\nvisualizing black-box models. Experiments with synthetic and medical data\ndemonstrate the practical applicability of our approach.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Bastian Pfeifer et.al.", "authors": "Bastian Pfeifer,Mateusz Krzyzinski,Hubert Baniecki,Anna Saranti,Andreas Holzinger,Przemyslaw Biecek", "id": "2307.07764v3", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07764v3", "repo": "https://github.com/pievos101/cpath"}}

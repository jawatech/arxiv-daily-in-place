Medical questions can now be successfully answered by\nartificial intelligence algorithms. It can help medical practitioners. This\nstudy evaluates the performance of three different artificial intelligence\nmodels in answering Turkish medical questions in the 2021 1st Term Medical\nSpecialization Examination (MSE). MSE consists of a total of 240 questions\nacross clinical (CMST) and basic (BMST) medical sciences. According to the\nresults in CMST, it was concluded that Gemini correctly answered 82 questions,\nChatGPT-4 answered 105 questions and ChatGPT-4o answered 117 questions. In\nBMST, Gemini and ChatGPT-4 answered 93 questions and ChatGPT-4o answered 107\nquestions correctly according to the answer key. ChatGPT-4o outperformed the\ncandidate with the highest scores of 113 and 106 according to CMST and BMST\nrespectively. This study highlights the importance of the potential of\nartificial intelligence in medical education and assessment. It demonstrates\nthat advanced models can achieve high accuracy and contextual understanding,\ndemonstrating their potential role in medical education and evaluation.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8a55\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\n\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u5df2\u8b49\u660e\u3002\u91ab\u5b78\u554f\u984c\u73fe\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u91ab\u7642\u5f9e\u696d\u8005\u3002\u672c\n\u7814\u7a76\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54 2021 \u5e74\u7b2c 1 \u5b78\u671f\u91ab\u5b78\n\u5c08\u79d1\u8003\u8a66 (MSE) \u4e2d\u7684\u571f\u8033\u5176\u91ab\u5b78\u554f\u984c\u6642\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002MSE \u7e3d\u5171\u5305\u542b 240 \u500b\n\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb\u81e8\u5e8a (CMST) \u548c\u57fa\u790e (BMST) \u91ab\u5b78\u79d1\u5b78\u3002\u6839\u64da\nCMST \u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff0cGemini \u6b63\u78ba\u56de\u7b54\u4e86 82 \u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\nChatGPT-4 \u56de\u7b54\u4e86 105 \u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u800c ChatGPT-4o \u56de\u7b54\u4e86 117 \u500b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\nBMST \u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u7b54\u6848\u95dc\u9375\uff0cGemini \u548c ChatGPT-4 \u56de\u7b54\u4e86 93 \u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u800c ChatGPT-4o \u56de\u7b54\u4e86 107\n\u500b\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6839\u64da CMST \u548c BMST\uff0cChatGPT-4o \u5206\u5225\u512a\u65bc\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\u7684 113 \u548c 106 \u7684\u8003\u751f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8a55\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u9ad8\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u8108\u7d61\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "author": "Yesim Aygul et.al.", "authors": "Yesim Aygul, Muge Olucoglu, Adil Alpkocak", "id": "2408.12305v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12305v1", "repo": "null"}}

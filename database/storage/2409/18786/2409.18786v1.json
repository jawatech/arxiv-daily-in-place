Despite promising,\ncurrent LLMs still exhibit significant dishonest behaviors, such as confidently\npresenting wrong answers or failing to express what they know. In addition,\nresearch on the honesty of LLMs also faces challenges, including varying\ndefinitions of honesty, difficulties in distinguishing between known and\nunknown knowledge, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of related\nresearch. To address these issues, we provide a survey on the honesty of LLMs,\ncovering its clarification, evaluation approaches, and strategies for\nimprovement. Moreover, we offer insights for future research, aiming to inspire\nfurther exploration in this important area.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8aa0\u5be6\u662f\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8207\u4eba\u985e\u50f9\u503c\u89c0\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5247\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u8a8d\u8b58\u5230\u5b83\u5011\u6240\u77e5\u548c\u4e0d\u77e5\u7684\u4e8b\u7269\uff0c\u4e26\u80fd\u5920\u5fe0\u5be6\u5730\u8868\u9054\u5176\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684 LLM \u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u8aa0\u5be6\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u932f\u8aa4\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u7121\u6cd5\u8868\u9054\u5b83\u5011\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c0d LLM \u8aa0\u5be6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u9762\u81e8\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8aa0\u5be6\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e0d\u540c\u3001\u96e3\u4ee5\u5340\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0d\u76f8\u95dc\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d LLM \u7684\u8aa0\u5be6\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u6db5\u84cb\u5176\u6f84\u6e05\u3001\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6539\u9032\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6fc0\u52f5\u5728\u9019\u500b\u91cd\u8981\u9818\u57df\u9032\u884c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "author": "Siheng Li et.al.", "authors": "Siheng Li, Cheng Yang, Taiqiang Wu, Chufan Shi, Yuji Zhang, Xinyu Zhu, Zesen Cheng, Deng Cai, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Jie Zhou, Yujiu Yang, Ngai Wong, Xixin Wu, Wai Lam", "id": "2409.18786v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18786v1", "repo": "https://github.com/sihengli99/llm-honesty-survey"}}

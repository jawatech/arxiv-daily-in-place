However, the effectiveness\nof LLMs is often constrained when operating individually in complex\nenvironments. This paper introduces a transformative approach by organizing\nLLMs into community-based structures, aimed at enhancing their collective\nintelligence and problem-solving capabilities. We investigate different\norganizational models-hierarchical, flat, dynamic, and federated-each\npresenting unique benefits and challenges for collaborative AI systems. Within\nthese structured communities, LLMs are designed to specialize in distinct\ncognitive tasks, employ advanced interaction mechanisms such as direct\ncommunication, voting systems, and market-based approaches, and dynamically\nadjust their governance structures to meet changing demands. The implementation\nof such communities holds substantial promise for improve problem-solving\ncapabilities in AI, prompting an in-depth examination of their ethical\nconsiderations, management strategies, and scalability potential. This position\npaper seeks to lay the groundwork for future research, advocating a paradigm\nshift from isolated to synergistic operational frameworks in AI research and\napplication.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8fd1\u671f\u767c\u5c55\u5df2\u5927\u5e45\u64f4\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLLM \u5728\u8907\u96dc\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u55ae\u7368\u904b\u4f5c\u6642\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u5e38\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u8b8a\u9769\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07 LLM \u7d44\u7e54\u6210\u57fa\u65bc\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u96c6\u9ad4\u667a\u6167\u548c\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7d44\u7e54\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968e\u5c64\u5f0f\u3001\u6241\u5e73\u5f0f\u3001\u52d5\u614b\u5f0f\u548c\u806f\u76df\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5354\u4f5c\u5f0f AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u90fd\u5448\u73fe\u7368\u7279\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0cLLM \u88ab\u8a2d\u8a08\u6210\u5c08\u7cbe\u65bc\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u9032\u968e\u4e92\u52d5\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\u6e9d\u901a\u3001\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7d71\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u5e02\u5834\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u52d5\u614b\u8abf\u6574\u5176\u6cbb\u7406\u7d50\u69cb\u4ee5\u6eff\u8db3\u4e0d\u65b7\u8b8a\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5be6\u4f5c\u6b64\u985e\u793e\u7fa4\u5c0d\u65bc\u63d0\u5347 AI \u7684\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u80fd\u529b\u6975\u5177\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u4e26\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7acb\u5834\u6587\u4ef6\u65e8\u5728\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u63d0\u5021\u5f9e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u904b\u4f5c\u67b6\u69cb\u8f49\u8b8a\u5230 AI \u7814\u7a76\u548c\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5354\u540c\u904b\u4f5c\u67b6\u69cb\u3002", "author": "Silvan Ferreira et.al.", "authors": "Silvan Ferreira, Ivanovitch Silva, Allan Martins", "id": "2405.03825v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03825v1", "repo": "null"}}

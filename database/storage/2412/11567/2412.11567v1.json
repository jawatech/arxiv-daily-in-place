Our systems use a combination of three retrieval models and\na reranker. We show that by exploiting a neural component of RePASs that\nextracts important sentences ('obligations') from the retrieved passages, we\nachieve a dubiously high score (0.947), even though the answers are directly\nextracted from the retrieved passages and are not actually generated answers.\nWe then show that by selecting the answer with the best RePASs among a few\ngenerated alternatives and then iteratively refining this answer by reducing\ncontradictions and covering more obligations, we can generate readable,\ncoherent answers that achieve a more plausible and relatively high score\n(0.639).", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u6211\u5011\u70ba RIRAG-2025 \u958b\u767c\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u5171\u7528\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u900f\u904e\u64f7\u53d6\u76f8\u95dc\u6bb5\u843d\u4f86\u56de\u7b54\u6cd5\u898f\u554f\u984c\u3002\u7522\u751f\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4f7f\u7528 RePASs \u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8cf4\u53c3\u8003\u4e14\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u500b\u64f7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528 RePASs \u7684\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u7d44\u4ef6\u5f9e\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u53e5\u5b50\uff08\u300c\u7fa9\u52d9\u300d\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u53ef\u7591\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\uff080.947\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u5f9e\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\uff0c\u4e14\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u4e26\u975e\u7522\u751f\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u63a5\u8457\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5e7e\u500b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5099\u9078\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u9078\u51fa RePASs \u6700\u4f73\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u900f\u904e\u6e1b\u5c11\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u6db5\u84cb\u66f4\u591a\u7fa9\u52d9\u4f86\u53cd\u8986\u7cbe\u7149\u9019\u500b\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u53ef\u8b80\u3001\u9023\u8cab\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4e26\u9054\u5230\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u76f8\u5c0d\u8f03\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u6578\uff080.639\uff09\u3002", "author": "Ioannis Chasandras et.al.", "authors": "Ioannis Chasandras, Odysseas S.

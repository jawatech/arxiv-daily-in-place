In the context of formal verification, these ideas can be used\nto produce guarantees on the correctness of multi-agent systems, with a diverse\nrange of applications from computer security to autonomous driving.\nPsychological games (PGs) were developed as a way to model and analyse agents\nwith belief-dependent motivations, opening up the possibility to model how\nhuman emotions can influence behaviour. In PGs, players' utilities depend not\nonly on what actually happens (which strategies players choose to adopt), but\nalso on what the players had expected to happen (their belief as to the\nstrategies that would be played). Despite receiving much attention in fields\nsuch as economics and psychology, very little consideration has been given to\ntheir applicability to problems in computer science, nor to practical\nalgorithms and tool support. In this paper, we start to bridge that gap,\nproposing methods to solve PGs and implementing them within PRISM-games, a\nformal verification tool for stochastic games. We discuss how to model these\ngames, highlight specific challenges for their analysis and illustrate the\nusefulness of our approach on several case studies, including human behaviour\nin traffic scenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u7406\u6027\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60f3\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u591a\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3002\u5fc3\u7406\u535a\u5f08 (PG) \u88ab\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5728 PG \u4e2d\uff0c\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff08\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8005\u9884\u671f\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff08\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u5c06\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff09\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u8003\u8651\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3 PG \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 PRISM-games \u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\uff0cPRISM-games \u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u535a\u5f08\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u65f6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "author": "Marta Kwiatkowska et.al.", "authors": "Marta Kwiatkowska, Gethin Norman, David Parker, Gabriel Santos", "id": "2411.05599v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05599v1", "repo": "null"}}

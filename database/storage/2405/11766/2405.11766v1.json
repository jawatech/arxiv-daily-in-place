The importance of this task of explainability by feature\nattribution is illustrated by the ubiquitous recent use of tools such as SHAP\nand LIME. Unfortunately, the exact computation of feature attributions, using\nthe game-theoretical foundation underlying SHAP and LIME, can yield manifestly\nunsatisfactory results, that tantamount to reporting misleading relative\nfeature importance. Recent work targeted rigorous feature attribution, by\nstudying axiomatic aggregations of features based on logic-based definitions of\nexplanations by feature selection. This paper shows that there is an essential\nrelationship between feature attribution and a priori voting power, and that\nthose recently proposed axiomatic aggregations represent a few instantiations\nof the range of power indices studied in the past. Furthermore, it remains\nunclear how some of the most widely used power indices might be exploited as\nfeature importance scores (FISs), i.e. the use of power indices in XAI, and\nwhich of these indices would be the best suited for the purposes of XAI by\nfeature attribution, namely in terms of not producing results that could be\ndeemed as unsatisfactory. This paper proposes novel desirable properties that\nFISs should exhibit. In addition, the paper also proposes novel FISs exhibiting\nthe proposed properties. Finally, the paper conducts a rigorous analysis of the\nbest-known power indices in terms of the proposed properties.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (XAI) \u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u91dd\u5c0d\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u7d66\u4e88\u76f8\u5c0d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u7d66\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u9810\u6e2c\u3002\u7279\u5fb5\u6b78\u5c6c\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u6b64\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u5f9e\u8fd1\u671f\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 SHAP \u548c LIME\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u898b\u4e00\u6591\u3002\u907a\u61be\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 SHAP \u548c LIME \u80cc\u5f8c\u535a\u5f08\u8ad6\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u7cbe\u78ba\u7279\u5fb5\u6b78\u5c6c\u8a08\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u7522\u751f\u660e\u986f\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u7b49\u540c\u65bc\u5831\u544a\u5177\u6709\u8aa4\u5c0e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5c0d\u7279\u5fb5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u91dd\u5c0d\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u6b78\u5c6c\u9032\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u57fa\u65bc\u7279\u5fb5\u9078\u64c7\u7684\u908f\u8f2f\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u516c\u7406\u805a\u5408\u4f86\u9032\u884c\u8aaa\u660e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u7279\u5fb5\u6b78\u5c6c\u8207\u5148\u9a57\u6295\u7968\u6b0a\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u8457\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u671f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u7406\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u904e\u53bb\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6b0a\u529b\u6307\u6578\u7bc4\u570d\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5be6\u4f8b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6b0a\u529b\u6307\u6578\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u7279\u5fb5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6578 (FIS)\uff0c\u4ea6\u5373\u5728 XAI \u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6b0a\u529b\u6307\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7279\u5fb5\u6b78\u5c6c\u7684 XAI \u76ee\u7684\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u54ea\u4e00\u500b\u6307\u6578\u6700\u9069\u5408\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u7522\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 FIS \u61c9\u5177\u5099\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u5099\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e FIS\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u91dd\u5c0d\u6700\u77e5\u540d\u7684\u6b0a\u529b\u6307\u6578\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6027\u9032\u884c\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "author": "Olivier Letoffe et.al.", "authors": "Olivier Letoffe, Xuanxiang Huang, Nicholas Asher, Joao Marques-Silva", "id": "2405.11766v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11766v1", "repo": "null"}}

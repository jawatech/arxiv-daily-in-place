Within this\npaper, we discuss potential benefits but also challenges that AIGC has for the\ncreation of inclusive and accessible virtual environments. Specifically, we\ntouch upon the decreased need for 3D modeling expertise, benefits of\nsymbolic-only as well as multimodal input, 3D content editing, and 3D model\naccessibility as well as foundation model-specific challenges.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5167\u5bb9 (AIGC) \u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u8f49\u8b8a\u4eba\u5011\u5efa\u69cb\u548c\u4e92\u52d5\u865b\u64ec\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6 AIGC \u5728\u5efa\u69cb\u5305\u5bb9\u4e14\u6613\u65bc\u5b58\u53d6\u7684\u865b\u64ec\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u597d\u8655\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5c0d 3D \u5efa\u6a21\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u50c5\u7b26\u865f\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u597d\u8655\u30013D \u5167\u5bb9\u7de8\u8f2f\u30013D \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5b58\u53d6\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Jens Grubert et.al.", "authors": "Jens Grubert, Junlong Chen, Per Ola Kristensson", "id": "2410.23803v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23803v1", "repo": "null"}}

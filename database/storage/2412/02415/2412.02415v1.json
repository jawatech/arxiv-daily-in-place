{"2412.02415": {"publish_time": "2024-12-03", "title": "Knowledge-Enhanced Conversational Recommendation via Transformer-based Sequential Modelling", "paper_summary": "In conversational recommender systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a\nset of items and item-related entities or attributes, e.g., director is a\nrelated entity of a movie. These items and item-related entities are often\nmentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential\ndependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential\nsequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based\nsequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the\nsequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we\nrepresent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct\nuser sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned\nitems and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy\na Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in\ncertain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related\nentities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of\nassociations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge\ngraphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called\nTSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our\nmodel TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of\nthe mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with\nmulti-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the\nenhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of\nTSCR.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u6703\u8a71\u5f0f\u63a8\u85a6\u7cfb\u7d71 (CRS) \u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0d\u8a71\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7d44\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u8207\u9805\u76ee\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u6216\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5c0e\u6f14\u662f\u96fb\u5f71\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u5be6\u9ad4\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u8207\u9805\u76ee\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u5728\u5c0d\u8a71\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u63d0\u53ca\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u5b83\u5011\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u73fe\u6709\u7684 CRS \u90fd\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc Transformer \u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u6703\u8a71\u63a8\u85a6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba TSCR\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c0d\u8a71\u4e2d\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u9032 CRS\u3002\u5728 TSCR \u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u8207\u9805\u76ee\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u4f86\u8868\u793a\u5c0d\u8a71\uff0c\u4e26\u69cb\u5efa\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u901a\u904e\u8003\u616e\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u8207\u9805\u76ee\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u4f86\u767c\u73fe\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u6839\u64da\u69cb\u5efa\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u500b\u5b8c\u5f62\u586b\u7a7a\u4efb\u52d9\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u9805\u76ee\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u7531\u9805\u76ee\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u95dc\u5be6\u9ad4\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u7372\u5f97\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u95dc\u806f\u3002\u9451\u65bc TSCR \u6c92\u6709\u5f9e\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 TSCR \u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u589e\u5f37\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba TSCRKG\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u96e2\u7dda\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b TSCRKG\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u8def\u5f91\u64f4\u5145\u5c0d\u8a71\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u5373\u5c0d\u8a71\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u8207\u9805\u76ee\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684 TSCR \u6a21\u578b\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u589e\u5f37\u7248\u672c TSCRKG \u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u9032\u4e86 TSCR \u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6027\u80fd\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Jie Zou et.al.", "authors": "Jie Zou, Aixin Sun, Cheng Long, Evangelos Kanoulas", "id": "2412.02415v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02415v1", "repo": "null"}}

To that end, a variety of datasets and Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding models has been proposed over the years. However, little is known\nabout the properties that render a dataset useful for a given task and, even\nthough theoretical properties of Knowledge Graph Embedding models are well\nunderstood, their practical utility in this field remains controversial. We\nconduct a comprehensive investigation into the topological properties of\npublicly available biomedical Knowledge Graphs and establish links to the\naccuracy observed in real-world applications. By releasing all model\npredictions and a new suite of analysis tools we invite the community to build\nupon our work and continue improving the understanding of these crucial\napplications.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u88dc\u5168\u5df2\u9010\u6f38\u88ab\u63a1\u7528\u70ba\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u591a\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u6709\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u85e5\u7269\u518d\u5229\u7528\u6216\u85e5\u7269\u9776\u6a19\u8b58\u5225\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u591a\u5e74\u4f86\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u8b93\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5c0d\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\u6240\u77e5\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u5c6c\u6027\u5df2\u5ee3\u70ba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u6027\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u722d\u8b70\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u516c\u958b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u7684\u62d3\u64b2\u5c6c\u6027\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u4e26\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8207\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u806f\u7e6b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u91cb\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u548c\u4e00\u5957\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9080\u8acb\u793e\u7fa4\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e26\u6301\u7e8c\u6539\u5584\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u95dc\u9375\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "author": "Alberto Cattaneo et.al.", "authors": "Alberto Cattaneo, Stephen Bonner, Thomas Martynec, Carlo Luschi, Ian P Barrett, Daniel Justus", "id": "2409.04103v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04103v1", "repo": "null"}}

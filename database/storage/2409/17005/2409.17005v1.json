While there are\nimportant advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we here\nhypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguistic\ncommunication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in ways\nthat are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two case\nstudies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language models\ninterpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematically\ndifferent word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in different\nways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered in\nnaturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent. We\nadvocate for AI systems that learn from and represent the communicative\nintentions latent in human-generated math.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6578\u5b78\u662f\u7531\u4eba\u70ba\u4eba\u5efa\u69cb\u7684\uff1a\u5c31\u50cf\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e0d\u50c5\u53cd\u6620\u547d\u984c\uff0c\u4e5f\u53cd\u6620\u8a9e\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0d\u50c5\u53cd\u6620\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u5be6\u9ad4\uff0c\u4e5f\u53cd\u6620\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u610f\u5716\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u4ee5\u7d14\u7cb9\u7684\u7b26\u865f\u65b9\u5f0f\u8655\u7406\u6578\u5b78\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u512a\u9ede\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6b64\u5047\u8a2d\u5c07\u6578\u5b78\u8996\u70ba\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6e9d\u901a\u662f\u6709\u597d\u8655\u7684\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u5e38\u9069\u5408\u9019\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u9019\u9ede\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7528\u5169\u500b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u8aaa\u660e\u9019\u4e9b\u89c0\u9ede\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u985e\u4f3c\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8a6e\u91cb\u7b49\u865f\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u57fa\u790e\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u7522\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u984c\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u4e3b\u7fa9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6392\u5217\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u4ed6\u9806\u5e8f\u5728\u908f\u8f2f\u4e0a\u662f\u7b49\u50f9\u7684\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u5021\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e26\u8868\u793a\u4eba\u985e\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u4e2d\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u610f\u5716\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002", "author": "Sasha Boguraev et.al.", "authors": "Sasha Boguraev, Ben Lipkin, Leonie Weissweiler, Kyle Mahowald", "id": "2409.17005v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17005v1", "repo": "null"}}

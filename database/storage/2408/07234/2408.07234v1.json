{"2408.07234": {"publish_time": "2024-08-13", "title": "Direction of Arrival Correction through Speech Quality Feedback", "paper_summary": "Real-time speech enhancement has began to rise in performance, and the Demucs\nDenoiser model has recently demonstrated strong performance in\nmultiple-speech-source scenarios when accompanied by a location-based speech\ntarget selection strategy. However, it has shown to be sensitive to errors in\nthe direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In this work, a DOA correction\nscheme is proposed that uses the real-time estimated speech quality of its\nenhanced output as the observed variable in an Adam-based optimization feedback\nloop to find the correct DOA. In spite of the high variability of the speech\nquality estimation, the proposed system is able to correct in real-time an\nerror of up to 15$^o$ using only the speech quality as its guide. Several\ninsights are provided for future versions of the proposed system to speed up\nconvergence and further reduce the speech quality estimation variability.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5373\u6642\u8a9e\u97f3\u589e\u5f37\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u958b\u59cb\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c Demucs \u964d\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u8a9e\u97f3\u4f86\u6e90\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d50\u5408\u57fa\u65bc\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8a9e\u97f3\u76ee\u6a19\u9078\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5f37\u52c1\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5c0d\u5230\u9054\u65b9\u5411 (DOA) \u4f30\u8a08\u8aa4\u5dee\u5f88\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b DOA \u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u589e\u5f37\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u5373\u6642\u4f30\u8a08\u8a9e\u97f3\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba Adam \u57fa\u65bc\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u56de\u994b\u8ff4\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u89c0\u5bdf\u8b8a\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u6b63\u78ba\u7684 DOA\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u8a9e\u97f3\u54c1\u8cea\u4f30\u8a08\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u80fd\u5920\u5373\u6642\u4fee\u6b63\u9ad8\u9054 15 \u5ea6\u7684\u8aa4\u5dee\uff0c\u50c5\u4f7f\u7528\u8a9e\u97f3\u54c1\u8cea\u4f5c\u70ba\u5176\u6307\u5357\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7e\u500b\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u4f9b\u672a\u4f86\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u7cfb\u7d71\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5feb\u6536\u6582\u901f\u5ea6\u4e26\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u8a9e\u97f3\u54c1\u8cea\u4f30\u8a08\u7684\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\u3002", "author": "Caleb Rascon et.al.", "authors": "Caleb Rascon", "id": "2408.07234v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07234v1", "repo": "null"}}

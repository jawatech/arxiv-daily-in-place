We propose a novel model named\nMI-DELIGHT for short text classification in this work. Specifically, it first\nperforms multi-source information (i.e., statistical information, linguistic\ninformation, and factual information) exploration to alleviate the sparsity\nissues. Then, the graph learning approach is adopted to learn the\nrepresentation of short texts, which are presented in graph forms. Moreover, we\nintroduce a dual-level (i.e., instance-level and cluster-level) contrastive\nlearning auxiliary task to effectively capture different-grained contrastive\ninformation within massive unlabeled data. Meanwhile, previous models merely\nperform the main task and auxiliary tasks in parallel, without considering the\nrelationship among tasks. Therefore, we introduce a hierarchical architecture\nto explicitly model the correlations between tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating that MI-DELIGHT\nsignificantly surpasses previous competitive models. It even outperforms\npopular large language models on several datasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u5206\u985e\u4f5c\u70ba\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5b50\u4e3b\u984c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u6a19\u8a18\u6a23\u672c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6230\u6027\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba MI-DELIGHT \u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u5206\u985e\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u57f7\u884c\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5373\u7d71\u8a08\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8a9e\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e8b\u5be6\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u7de9\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u554f\u984c\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u5716\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee5\u5716\u8868\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73fe\u7684\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u96d9\u5c64\u7d1a\uff08\u5373\u5be6\u4f8b\u5c64\u7d1a\u548c\u7fa4\u96c6\u5c64\u7d1a\uff09\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u8f14\u52a9\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u7372\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6a19\u8a18\u6578\u64da\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c0d\u6bd4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u50c5\u4e26\u884c\u57f7\u884c\u4e3b\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u8f14\u52a9\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u800c\u6c92\u6709\u8003\u616e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5206\u5c64\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u660e\u78ba\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52d9\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u57fa\u6e96\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u8b49\u660e MI-DELIGHT \u660e\u986f\u512a\u65bc\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5e7e\u500b\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u512a\u65bc\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Yonghao Liu et.al.", "authors": "Yonghao Liu, Mengyu Li, Wei Pang, Fausto Giunchiglia, Lan Huang, Xiaoyue Feng, Renchu Guan", "id": "2501.09214v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09214v1", "repo": "https://github.com/keaml-jlu/mi-delight"}}

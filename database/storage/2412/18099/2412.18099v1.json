Previously, the dominant modeling system was the\nsingle-station models. Such models digest signal data received at a given\nstation and predict earth-quake parameters, such as the p-phase arrival time,\nintensity, and magnitude at that location. Various methods have demonstrated\nadequate performance. However, most of these methods present the challenges of\nthe difficulty of speeding up the alarm time, providing early warning for\ndistant areas, and considering global information to enhance performance.\nRecently, deep learning has significantly impacted many fields, including\nseismology. Thus, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework, called\nSENSE, for the intensity prediction task of earthquake early warning systems.\nTo explicitly consider global information from a regional or national\nperspective, the input to SENSE comprises statistics from a set of stations in\na given region or country. The SENSE model is designed to learn the\nrelationships among the set of input stations and the locality-specific\ncharacteristics of each station. Thus, SENSE is not only expected to provide\nmore reliable forecasts by considering multistation data but also has the\nability to provide early warnings to distant areas that have not yet received\nsignals. This study conducted extensive experiments on datasets from Taiwan and\nJapan. The results revealed that SENSE can deliver competitive or even better\nperformances compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5730\u9707\u9810\u8b66\u7cfb\u7d71\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5730\u9707\u707d\u5bb3\u98a8\u96aa\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7d71\u662f\u55ae\u7ad9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u6703\u6d88\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u7ad9\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u8a0a\u865f\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e26\u9810\u6e2c\u5730\u9707\u53c3\u6578\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8a72\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684 P \u6ce2\u5230\u9054\u6642\u9593\u3001\u5f37\u5ea6\u548c\u898f\u6a21\u3002\u5404\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u9762\u81e8\u96e3\u4ee5\u7e2e\u77ed\u8b66\u5831\u6642\u9593\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u9060\u5730\u5340\u7684\u9810\u8b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u8003\u91cf\u5168\u7403\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5df2\u5c0d\u8a31\u591a\u9818\u57df\u7522\u751f\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u9707\u5b78\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u540d\u70ba SENSE \u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5730\u9707\u9810\u8b66\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5f37\u5ea6\u9810\u6e2c\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u660e\u78ba\u5730\u8003\u91cf\u5340\u57df\u6216\u570b\u5bb6\u89c0\u9ede\u7684\u5168\u7403\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0cSENSE \u7684\u8f38\u5165\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5b9a\u5340\u57df\u6216\u570b\u5bb6\u4e00\u7d44\u7ad9\u7684\u7d71\u8a08\u8cc7\u6599\u3002SENSE \u6a21\u578b\u65e8\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u8f38\u5165\u7ad9\u7d44\u8207\u6bcf\u500b\u7ad9\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5fb5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9810\u671f SENSE \u4e0d\u50c5\u80fd\u900f\u904e\u8003\u91cf\u591a\u7ad9\u8cc7\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\uff0c\u9084\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c1a\u672a\u6536\u5230\u8a0a\u865f\u7684\u9060\u5730\u5340\u9810\u8b66\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c0d\u4f86\u81ea\u81fa\u7063\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSENSE \u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Yu-Ming Huang et.al.", "authors": "Yu-Ming Huang, Kuan-Yu Chen, Wen-Wei Lin, Da-Yi Chen", "id": "2412.18099v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18099v1", "repo": "null"}}

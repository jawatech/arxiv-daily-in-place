Based on large language models (LLMs),\ngenerative AI has been found to perform as well as humans in simulated\nsituations taking medical board exams, answering clinical questions, solving\nclinical cases, applying clinical reasoning, and summarizing information.\nGenerative AI is also being used widely in education, performing well in\nacademic courses and their assessments. This review summarizes the successes of\nLLMs and highlights some of their challenges in the context of education, most\nnotably aspects that may undermines the acquisition of knowledge and skills for\nprofessional work. It then provides recommendations for best practices\novercoming shortcomings for LLM use in education. Although there are challenges\nfor use of generative AI in education, all students and faculty, in biomedicine\nand health and beyond, must have understanding and be competent in its use.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5c0d\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u9818\u57df\u7522\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u9060\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u5728\u5c08\u696d\u5de5\u4f5c\u9084\u662f\u6559\u80b2\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5728\u6a21\u64ec\u91ab\u7642\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u8003\u8a66\u3001\u56de\u7b54\u81e8\u5e8a\u554f\u984c\u3001\u89e3\u6c7a\u81e8\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u3001\u61c9\u7528\u81e8\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7e3d\u7d50\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7b49\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u73fe\u5f97\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u4e00\u6a23\u597d\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u4e5f\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5b78\u8853\u8ab2\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u826f\u597d\u3002\u672c\u7bc7\u8a55\u8ad6\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e86 LLM \u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6700\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u640d\u5bb3\u5c08\u696d\u5de5\u4f5c\u77e5\u8b58\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u7fd2\u5f97\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u5b83\u91dd\u5c0d\u514b\u670d LLM \u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5be6\u52d9\u5efa\u8b70\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u7269\u91ab\u5b78\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u9818\u57df\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5b78\u751f\u548c\u6559\u8077\u54e1\u5de5\u90fd\u5fc5\u9808\u4e86\u89e3\u4e26\u719f\u7df4\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002", "author": "William Hersh et.al.", "authors": "William Hersh", "id": "2501.10186v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10186v1", "repo": "null"}}

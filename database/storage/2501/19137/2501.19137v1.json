{"2501.19137": {"publish_time": "2025-01-31", "title": "A Metric for the Balance of Information in Graph Learning", "paper_summary": "Graph learning on molecules makes use of information from both the molecular\nstructure and the features attached to that structure. Much work has been\nconducted on biasing either towards structure or features, with the aim that\nbias bolsters performance. Identifying which information source a dataset\nfavours, and therefore how to approach learning that dataset, is an open issue.\nHere we propose Noise-Noise Ratio Difference (NNRD), a quantitative metric for\nwhether there is more useful information in structure or features. By employing\niterative noising on features and structure independently, leaving the other\nintact, NNRD measures the degradation of information in each. We employ NNRD\nover a range of molecular tasks, and show that it corresponds well to a loss of\ninformation, with intuitive results that are more expressive than simple\nperformance aggregates. Our future work will focus on expanding data domains,\ntasks and types, as well as refining our choice of baseline model.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5206\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u5b78\u7fd2\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u7d50\u69cb\u548c\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u8a72\u7d50\u69cb\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u4e2d\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5df2\u91dd\u5c0d\u7d50\u69cb\u6216\u7279\u5fb5\u9032\u884c\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u504f\u5411\u80fd\u589e\u5f37\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u8b58\u5225\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u6e90\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5982\u4f55\u8457\u624b\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a72\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u958b\u653e\u6027\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u96dc\u8a0a\u96dc\u8a0a\u6bd4\u5dee\u7570 (NNRD)\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5224\u65b7\u7d50\u69cb\u6216\u7279\u5fb5\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u6709\u7528\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u900f\u904e\u7368\u7acb\u5730\u5c0d\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u7d50\u69cb\u9032\u884c\u53cd\u8986\u96dc\u8a0a\u8655\u7406\uff0c\u8b93\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\uff0cNNRD \u6e2c\u91cf\u6bcf\u500b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u52a3\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u63a1\u7528 NNRD\uff0c\u4e26\u986f\u793a\u5b83\u8207\u8cc7\u8a0a\u640d\u5931\u975e\u5e38\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u76f4\u89c0\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u6bd4\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5f59\u7e3d\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u9054\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c07\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u64f4\u5145\u8cc7\u6599\u9818\u57df\u3001\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u985e\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cbe\u9032\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u57fa\u7dda\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u3002", "author": "Alex O.

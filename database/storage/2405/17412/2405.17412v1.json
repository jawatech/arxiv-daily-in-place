This interpretation\noffers deeper theoretical insights into these algorithms, while introducing\ntools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u964d\u7dad\u65b9\u6cd5 UMAP \u548c t-SNE\uff0c\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5730\u6539\u5beb\u70ba\u5c0d\u61c9\u65bc ProbDR \u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5ee3\u7fa9 Wishart \u6a21\u578b\u7684 MAP \u63a8\u8ad6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u8a6e\u91cb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u985e\u4f3c\u964d\u7dad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "author": "Aditya Ravuri et.al.", "authors": "Aditya Ravuri, Neil D.

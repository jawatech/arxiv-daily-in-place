{"2501.18950": {"publish_time": "2025-01-31", "title": "Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them", "paper_summary": "Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk\nof harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning\nundesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a\nspecific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral\nconcept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this\nfixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of\nerasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the\nconcept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one\nconcept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric\nproperties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is\nconfined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive\nGuided Erasure (AGE) method, which \\emph{dynamically} selects optimal target\nconcepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side\neffects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while\nmaintaining effective erasure performance.

{"2405.14781": {"publish_time": "2024-05-23", "title": "Unified Neural Backdoor Removal with Only Few Clean Samples through Unlearning and Relearning", "paper_summary": "The application of deep neural network models in various security-critical\napplications has raised significant security concerns, particularly the risk of\nbackdoor attacks. Neural backdoors pose a serious security threat as they allow\nattackers to maliciously alter model behavior. While many defenses have been\nexplored, existing approaches are often bounded by model-specific constraints,\nor necessitate complex alterations to the training process, or fall short\nagainst diverse backdoor attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel method for\ncomprehensive and effective elimination of backdoors, called ULRL (short for\nUnLearn and ReLearn for backdoor removal). ULRL requires only a small set of\nclean samples and works effectively against all kinds of backdoors. It first\napplies unlearning for identifying suspicious neurons and then targeted neural\nweight tuning for backdoor mitigation (i.e., by promoting significant weight\ndeviation on the suspicious neurons). Evaluated against 12 different types of\nbackdoors, ULRL is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods\nin eliminating backdoors whilst preserving the model utility.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u5b89\u5168\u95dc\u9375\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u5f15\u767c\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7591\u616e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u795e\u7d93\u5f8c\u9580\u69cb\u6210\u56b4\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5141\u8a31\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u60e1\u610f\u5730\u6539\u8b8a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5df2\u7d93\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u9632\u79a6\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7d04\u675f\uff0c\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5c0d\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u9032\u884c\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u6216\u7121\u6cd5\u61c9\u5c0d\u5404\u7a2e\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5168\u9762\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6d88\u9664\u5f8c\u9580\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba ULRL\uff08\u5f8c\u9580\u79fb\u9664\u7684 UnLearn \u548c ReLearn \u7684\u7e2e\u5beb\uff09\u3002ULRL \u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5c0f\u7d44\u4e7e\u6de8\u7684\u6a23\u672c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c0d\u6297\u6240\u6709\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u61c9\u7528\u53d6\u6d88\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u8b58\u5225\u53ef\u7591\u795e\u7d93\u5143\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u91dd\u5c0d\u795e\u7d93\u6b0a\u91cd\u8abf\u6574\u9032\u884c\u5f8c\u9580\u7de9\u89e3\uff08\u5373\u901a\u904e\u5728\u53ef\u7591\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u4e0a\u4fc3\u9032\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6b0a\u91cd\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002\u6839\u64da 12 \u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0cULRL \u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u5f8c\u9580\u7684\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Nay Myat Min et.al.", "authors": "Nay Myat Min, Long H.

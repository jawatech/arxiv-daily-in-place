It can\nrevolutionize the dementia care settings. It is essential that the medical\ncommunity be aware of various AI assessments and choose them considering their\ndegrees of validity, efficiency, practicality, reliability, and accuracy\nconcerning the early identification of patients with dementia (PwD). On the\nother hand, AI developers should be informed about various non-AI assessments\nas well as recently developed AI assessments. Thus, this paper, which can be\nreadable by both clinicians and AI engineers, fills the gap in the literature\nin explaining the existing solutions for the recognition of dementia to\nclinicians, as well as the techniques used and the most widespread dementia\ndatasets to AI engineers. It follows a review of papers on AI and non-AI\nassessments for dementia to provide valuable information about various dementia\nassessments for both the AI and medical communities. The discussion and\nconclusion highlight the most prominent research directions and the maturity of\nexisting solutions.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Mahboobeh Parsapoor et.al.", "authors": "Mahboobeh Parsapoor,Hamed Ghodrati,Vincenzo Dentamaro,Christopher R.

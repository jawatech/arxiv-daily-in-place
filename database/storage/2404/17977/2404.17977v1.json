We addressed this complex task by decomposing it into\nsmaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is handled by a specialized\nAI agent. We conduct a systematic study of the impact of various prompting\nstrategies on these agents and benchmark different Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto determine their accuracy in completing these tasks. Additionally, we\ninvestigate how these agents can provide explainability, thereby enhancing\ntrust and transparency within the system.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Himanshu Pandey et.al.", "authors": "Himanshu Pandey,Akhil Amod,Shivang", "id": "2404.17977v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17977v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, how they can best be developed for oncology remains\nunderdeveloped. State-of-the-art OpenAI models were fine-tuned on a clinical\ndataset and clinical guidelines text corpus for two important cancer treatment\nfactors, adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy, using a novel Langchain\nprompt engineering pipeline. A high accuracy (0.85+) was achieved in the\nclassification of adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy for breast cancer\npatients. Furthermore, a confidence interval was formed from observational data\non the quality of treatment from human oncologists to estimate the proportion\nof scenarios in which the model must outperform the original oncologist in its\ntreatment prediction to be a better solution overall as 8.2% to 13.3%. Due to\nindeterminacy in the outcomes of cancer treatment decisions, future\ninvestigation, potentially a clinical trial, would be required to determine if\nthis threshold was met by the models. Nevertheless, with 85% of U.S. cancer\npatients receiving treatment at local community facilities, these kinds of\nmodels could play an important part in expanding access to quality care with\noutcomes that lie, at minimum, close to a human oncologist.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5df2\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u5b78\u79d1\u5275\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u624d\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u958b\u767c\u5b83\u5011\u4ee5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u816b\u7624\u5b78\u4ecd\u672a\u6210\u719f\u3002\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 OpenAI \u6a21\u578b\u7d93\u904e\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u81e8\u5e8a\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u548c\u81e8\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u6587\u672c\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684 Langchain \u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u5169\u500b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7642\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8f14\u52a9\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u5316\u7642\u3002\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8f14\u52a9\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u5316\u7642\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6 (0.85+)\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u4eba\u985e\u816b\u7624\u5b78\u5bb6\u5c0d\u6cbb\u7642\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u89c0\u5bdf\u6578\u64da\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5340\u9593\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8a08\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u9808\u5728\u5176\u6cbb\u7642\u9810\u6e2c\u4e2d\u512a\u65bc\u539f\u59cb\u816b\u7624\u5b78\u5bb6\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6574\u9ad4\u4e0a\u6210\u70ba\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u70ba 8.2% \u81f3 13.3%\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7642\u6c7a\u7b56\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u81e8\u5e8a\u8a66\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9054\u5230\u6b64\u9580\u6abb\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7531\u65bc 85% \u7684\u7f8e\u570b\u764c\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u7576\u5730\u793e\u5340\u8a2d\u65bd\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7642\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u64f4\u5927\u7372\u5f97\u512a\u8cea\u7167\u8b77\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u7d50\u679c\u81f3\u5c11\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u985e\u816b\u7624\u5b78\u5bb6\u3002", "author": "Tristen Pool et.al.", "authors": "Tristen Pool, Dennis Trujillo", "id": "2406.06455v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06455v2", "repo": "null"}}

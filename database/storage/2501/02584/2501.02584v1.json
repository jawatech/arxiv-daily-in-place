However, challenges persist in the accurate recognition of fine\ndetails within high resolution images, which limits performance in multiple\ntasks. This work introduces Pheye, a novel architecture that efficiently\nprocesses high-resolution images while training fewer parameters than similarly\nsized VLMs. Notably, Pheye achieves a high efficiency while maintaining strong\nperformance, particularly in tasks that demand fine-grained image understanding\nand/or the handling of scene-text.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8996\u89ba\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (VLM) \u8fd1\u671f\u7d93\u6b77\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u78ba\u8fa8\u8b58\u7cbe\u7d30\u7d30\u7bc0\u7684\u6311\u6230\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9019\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u57f7\u884c\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Pheye\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u53c3\u6578\u5c11\u65bc\u540c\u7b49\u898f\u6a21 VLM \u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5730\u8655\u7406\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6\u5f71\u50cf\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0cPheye \u5728\u7dad\u6301\u5f37\u5927\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7d30\u7dfb\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c/\u6216\u8655\u7406\u5834\u666f\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u3002", "author": "Miguel Carvalho et.al.", "authors": "Miguel Carvalho, Bruno Martins", "id": "2501.02584v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02584v1", "repo": "null"}}

A supervised contrastive loss operates by enforcing that\nimages with the same class label (positive samples) project closer to each\nother than images with differing class labels (negative samples). The advantage\nof this approach is that it directly penalizes the structure of the\nrepresentation space itself. This enables greater flexibility with respect to\nencoding semantic concepts. However, the standard supervised contrastive loss\nonly enforces semantic structure based on the downstream task (i.e. the class\nlabel). In reality, the class label is only one level of a \\emph{hierarchy of\ndifferent semantic relationships known as a taxonomy}. For example, the class\nlabel is oftentimes the species of an animal, but between different classes\nthere are higher order relationships such as all animals with wings being\n``birds\". We show that by explicitly accounting for these relationships with a\nweighting penalty in the contrastive loss we can out-perform the supervised\ncontrastive loss. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of the notion\nof a taxonomy by integrating our loss into medical and noise-based settings\nthat show performance improvements by as much as 7%.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u76e3\u7763\u5c0d\u6bd4\u640d\u5931\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u5206\u985e\u5c64\u7d1a\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u76e3\u7763\u5c0d\u6bd4\u640d\u5931\u900f\u904e\u5f37\u5236\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u7c64\uff08\u6b63\u6a23\u672c\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u7c64\uff08\u8ca0\u6a23\u672c\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f7c\u6b64\u4f86\u904b\u4f5c\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u662f\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u61f2\u7f70\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u9593\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u7de8\u78bc\u8a9e\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9748\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6a19\u6e96\u7684\u76e3\u7763\u5c0d\u6bd4\u640d\u5931\u50c5\u6839\u64da\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u5373\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u7c64\uff09\u4f86\u5f37\u5236\u8a9e\u610f\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\uff0c\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u7c64\u53ea\u662f\u7a31\u70ba\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u610f\u95dc\u4fc2\u5c64\u7d1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u5c64\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u985e\u5225\u6a19\u7c64\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u52d5\u7269\u7684\u7269\u7a2e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u985e\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u968e\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6240\u6709\u6709\u7fc5\u8180\u7684\u52d5\u7269\u90fd\u662f\u300c\u9ce5\u985e\u300d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5c0d\u6bd4\u640d\u5931\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6b0a\u61f2\u7f70\u4f86\u660e\u78ba\u8aaa\u660e\u9019\u4e9b\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u76e3\u7763\u5c0d\u6bd4\u640d\u5931\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u6027\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u640d\u5931\u6574\u5408\u5230\u91ab\u7642\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u96dc\u8a0a\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u986f\u793a\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 7%\u3002", "author": "Kiran Kokilepersaud et.al.", "authors": "Kiran Kokilepersaud, Yavuz Yarici, Mohit Prabhushankar, Ghassan AlRegib", "id": "2406.06848v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06848v1", "repo": "null"}}

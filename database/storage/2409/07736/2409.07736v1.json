Initially, it relied\non handcrafted features and rule-based algorithms, resulting in limited\naccuracy. The introduction of machine learning (ML) has brought progress,\nparticularly Transfer Learning (TL), which addresses various CV problems by\nreusing pre-trained models. TL requires less data and computing while\ndelivering nearly equal accuracy, making it a prominent technique in the CV\nlandscape. Our research focuses on TL development and how CV applications use\nit to solve real-world problems. We discuss recent developments, limitations,\nand opportunities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96fb\u8166\u8996\u89ba\uff08CV\uff09\u9818\u57df\u9762\u81e8\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u624b\u5de5\u88fd\u4f5c\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08ML\uff09\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5e36\u4f86\u4e86\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u8f49\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08TL\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u900f\u904e\u91cd\u8907\u4f7f\u7528\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5404\u7a2e CV \u554f\u984c\u3002TL \u9700\u8981\u8f03\u5c11\u8cc7\u6599\u548c\u904b\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4e4e\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u70ba CV \u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u5091\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc TL \u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca CV \u61c9\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u73fe\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6a5f\u6703\u3002", "author": "Aaryan Panda et.al.", "authors": "Aaryan Panda, Damodar Panigrahi, Shaswata Mitra, Sudip Mittal, Shahram Rahimi", "id": "2409.07736v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07736v1", "repo": "null"}}

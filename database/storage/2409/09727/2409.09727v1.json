Although numerous recent studies suggest or\nutilize federated learning based methods in healthcare, it remains unclear\nwhich ones have potential clinical utility. This review paper considers and\nanalyzes the most recent studies up to May 2024 that describe federated\nlearning based methods in healthcare. After a thorough review, we find that the\nvast majority are not appropriate for clinical use due to their methodological\nflaws and/or underlying biases which include but are not limited to privacy\nconcerns, generalization issues, and communication costs. As a result, the\neffectiveness of federated learning in healthcare is significantly compromised.\nTo overcome these challenges, we provide recommendations and promising\nopportunities that might be implemented to resolve these problems and improve\nthe quality of model development in federated learning with healthcare.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u78ba\u4fdd\u8cc7\u6599\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u81f4\u53d7\u640d\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u70ba\u5927\u578b\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8de8\u591a\u500b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u8a31\u591a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8b70\u6216\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u54ea\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u8a55\u8ad6\u6587\u7ae0\u8003\u616e\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u622a\u81f3 2024 \u5e74 5 \u6708\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u65bc\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5728\u5fb9\u5e95\u6aa2\u95b1\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u7d55\u5927\u591a\u6578\u4e0d\u9069\u5408\u81e8\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\u7f3a\u9677\u548c/\u6216\u6f5b\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f46\u4e0d\u9650\u65bc\u96b1\u79c1\u554f\u984c\u3001\u6982\u5316\u554f\u984c\u548c\u901a\u8a0a\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u986f\u8457\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u8b70\u548c\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a5f\u6703\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u88ab\u5be6\u65bd\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u4e26\u63d0\u9ad8\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u4e2d\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u958b\u767c\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u3002", "author": "Ming Li et.al.", "authors": "Ming Li, Pengcheng Xu, Junjie Hu, Zeyu Tang, Guang Yang", "id": "2409.09727v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09727v1", "repo": "null"}}

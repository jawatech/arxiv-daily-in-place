In addition,\nhigh-quality data related to TCM is scarce and difficult to obtain, making\nlarge language models ineffective in handling TCM tasks. In this work, we\npropose a framework to improve the performance of large language models for TCM\ntasks using only a small amount of data. First, we use medical case data for\nsupervised fine-tuning of the large model, making it initially capable of\nperforming TCM tasks. Subsequently, we further optimize the model's performance\nusing reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) to align it with the\npreference data. The ablation study also demonstrated the performance gain is\nattributed to both supervised fine-tuning and the direct policy optimization.\nThe experimental results show that the model trained with a small amount of\ndata achieves a significant performance improvement on a representative TCM\ntask.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u56de\u61c9\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u610f\u5716\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73fe\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u50b3\u7d71\u4e2d\u91ab (TCM) \u7b49\u5c08\u696d\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8207\u4e2d\u91ab\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u8cc7\u6599\u7a00\u5c11\u4e14\u96e3\u4ee5\u53d6\u5f97\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8655\u7406\u4e2d\u91ab\u4efb\u52d9\u6642\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5f70\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u91ab\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u91ab\u7642\u6848\u4f8b\u8cc7\u6599\u5c0d\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u76e3\u7763\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6700\u521d\u5177\u5099\u57f7\u884c\u4e2d\u91ab\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u56de\u994b\u7684\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RLAIF) \u4f86\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8207\u504f\u597d\u8cc7\u6599\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u8868\u73fe\u63d0\u5347\u6b78\u529f\u65bc\u76e3\u7763\u5fae\u8abf\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8cc7\u6599\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4e2d\u91ab\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "author": "Song Yu et.al.", "authors": "Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Fangfei Xu, Li Li", "id": "2411.00897v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00897v1", "repo": "null"}}

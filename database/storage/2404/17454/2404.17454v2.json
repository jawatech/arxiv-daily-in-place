Single-cell sequencing data\nprovide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly\ndetection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample\nand multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous\ncells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth,\na novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates\nthe detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous\ncells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first\ntheoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative\nmodels for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us\nto develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer\nin ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types\nof tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art\nmethods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain\ncontexts.

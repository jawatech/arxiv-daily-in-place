However, current\nhypergraph models are encountering challenges related to imbalanced data, as\nthis imbalance can lead to biases in the model towards the more prevalent\nclasses. While the existing techniques, such as GraphSMOTE, have improved\nclassification accuracy for minority samples in graph data, they still fall\nshort when addressing the unique structure of hypergraphs. Inspired by SMOTE\nconcept, we propose HyperSMOTE as a solution to alleviate the class imbalance\nissue in hypergraph learning. This method involves a two-step process:\ninitially synthesizing minority class nodes, followed by the nodes integration\ninto the original hypergraph. We synthesize new nodes based on samples from\nminority classes and their neighbors. At the same time, in order to solve the\nproblem on integrating the new node into the hypergraph, we train a decoder\nbased on the original hypergraph incidence matrix to adaptively associate the\naugmented node to hyperedges. We conduct extensive evaluation on multiple\nsingle-modality datasets, such as Cora, Cora-CA and Citeseer, as well as\nmultimodal conversation dataset MELD to verify the effectiveness of HyperSMOTE,\nshowing an average performance gain of 3.38% and 2.97% on accuracy,\nrespectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8d85\u5716\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u76f8\u8f03\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u5716\u5f62\u66f4\u512a\u7570\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7bc0\u9ede\u9593\u9ad8\u968e\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u55ae\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6578\u64da\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u524d\u8d85\u5716\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5c0d\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6578\u64da\u6642\u6703\u9047\u5230\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0e\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u8f03\u666e\u904d\u7684\u985e\u5225\u7522\u751f\u504f\u898b\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 GraphSMOTE\uff0c\u5df2\u6539\u5584\u5716\u5f62\u6578\u64da\u4e2d\u5c11\u6578\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8655\u7406\u8d85\u5716\u7684\u7368\u7279\u7d50\u69cb\u6642\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u53d7 SMOTE \u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa HyperSMOTE \u4f5c\u70ba\u89e3\u6c7a\u8d85\u5716\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u985e\u5225\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u554f\u984c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u4e00\u500b\u5169\u6b65\u9a5f\u7684\u904e\u7a0b\uff1a\u6700\u521d\u5408\u6210\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u7bc0\u9ede\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c07\u7bc0\u9ede\u6574\u5408\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u8d85\u5716\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u5c11\u6578\u985e\u5225\u53ca\u5176\u9130\u5c45\u7684\u6a23\u672c\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7bc0\u9ede\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5c07\u65b0\u7bc0\u9ede\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8d85\u5716\u4e2d\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u539f\u59cb\u8d85\u5716\u7684\u767c\u751f\u77e9\u9663\u8a13\u7df4\u4e00\u500b\u89e3\u78bc\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u5730\u5c07\u64f4\u5145\u7bc0\u9ede\u8207\u8d85\u908a\u7de3\u95dc\u806f\u8d77\u4f86\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u591a\u500b\u55ae\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\u6578\u64da\u96c6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 Cora\u3001Cora-CA \u548c Citeseer\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u5c0d\u8a71\u6578\u64da\u96c6 MELD \u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a57\u8b49 HyperSMOTE \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u5728\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u5225\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 3.38% \u548c 2.97%\u3002", "author": "Ziming Zhao et.al.", "authors": "Ziming Zhao, Tiehua Zhang, Zijian Yi, Zhishu Shen", "id": "2409.05402v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05402v1", "repo": "null"}}

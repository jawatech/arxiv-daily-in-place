Recent research has demonstrated that\ndesigning AI agents to account for human behavior leads to improved performance\nin human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is\ntheir assumption that human behavior is static, irrespective of AI behavior. In\nreality, humans may adjust their action plans based on their observations of AI\nbehavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative\nAI agent to consider the beliefs of its human partner, i.e., what the human\npartner thinks the AI agent is doing, and design its action plan to facilitate\neasier collaboration with its human partner. Specifically, we developed a model\nof human beliefs that accounts for how humans reason about the behavior of\ntheir AI partners. Based on this belief model, we then developed an AI agent\nthat considers both human behavior and human beliefs in devising its strategy\nfor working with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject\nexperiments, we demonstrated that our belief model more accurately predicts\nhumans' beliefs about AI behavior. Moreover, we showed that our design of AI\nagents that accounts for human beliefs enhances performance in human-AI\ncollaboration.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u8981\u5be6\u73fe\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5354\u4f5c\uff0c\u50c5\u512a\u5316\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u985e\u662f\u4e0d\u5920\u7684\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4ee3\u7406\u4f86\u8003\u91cf\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u6703\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u6a5f\u5354\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u5728\u65bc\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\u662f\u975c\u614b\u7684\uff0c\u8207\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u884c\u70ba\u7121\u95dc\u3002\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u6839\u64da\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u89c0\u5bdf\u4f86\u8abf\u6574\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u884c\u52d5\u8a08\u756b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u8b93\u5354\u4f5c\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4ee3\u7406\u8003\u616e\u5176\u4eba\u985e\u5925\u4f34\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff08\u5373\u4eba\u985e\u5925\u4f34\u8a8d\u70ba\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u505a\u4ec0\u9ebc\uff09\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e26\u8a2d\u8a08\u5176\u884c\u52d5\u8a08\u756b\u4ee5\u4fc3\u9032\u8207\u5176\u4eba\u985e\u5925\u4f34\u66f4\u8f15\u9b06\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u4eba\u985e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u4eba\u985e\u5982\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u5176\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5925\u4f34\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a5\u8457\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u70ba\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u5408\u4f5c\u5236\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6642\uff0c\u6703\u8003\u616e\u4eba\u985e\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u4eba\u985e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u985e\u53d7\u8a66\u8005\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u9810\u6e2c\u4e86\u4eba\u985e\u5c0d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u8003\u616e\u4eba\u985e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4ee3\u7406\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u4eba\u6a5f\u5354\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Guanghui Yu et.al.", "authors": "Guanghui Yu, Robert Kasumba, Chien-Ju Ho, William Yeoh", "id": "2406.06051v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06051v1", "repo": "null"}}

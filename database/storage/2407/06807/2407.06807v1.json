However, several recent works have pointed\nout that imperceptible and carefully designed adversarial examples (attacks)\ncan significantly deteriorate the classification accuracy. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a defense mechanism based on both training-time and run-time\ndefense techniques for protecting machine learning-based radio signal\n(modulation) classification against adversarial attacks. The training-time\ndefense consists of adversarial training and label smoothing, while the\nrun-time defense employs a support vector machine-based neural rejection (NR).\nConsidering a white-box scenario and real datasets, we demonstrate that our\nproposed techniques outperform existing state-of-the-art technologies.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u53d7\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u7684\u512a\u7570\u6548\u80fd\u6240\u6fc0\u52f5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96fb\u8166\u8996\u89ba\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u5e7e\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5c07\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7121\u7dda\u7db2\u8def\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u5e7e\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u96e3\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89ba\u4e14\u7d93\u904e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff08\u653b\u64ca\uff09\u6703\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e00\u7a2e\u9632\u79a6\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u548c\u57f7\u884c\u6642\u9593\u9632\u79a6\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u4fdd\u8b77\u57fa\u65bc\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7121\u7dda\u96fb\u8a0a\u865f\uff08\u8abf\u8b8a\uff09\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u79a6\u5c0d\u6297\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\u9632\u79a6\u5305\u542b\u5c0d\u6297\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6a19\u7c64\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u800c\u57f7\u884c\u6642\u9593\u9632\u79a6\u5247\u63a1\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u62d2\u7d55 (NR)\u3002\u8003\u91cf\u767d\u76d2\u60c5\u5883\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u8853\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u6280\u8853\u3002", "author": "Lu Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Lu Zhang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Gan Zheng, Guisheng Liao, Ambra Demontis, Fabio Roli", "id": "2407.06807v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06807v1", "repo": "null"}}

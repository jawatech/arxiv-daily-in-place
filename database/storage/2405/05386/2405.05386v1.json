At present, interpretability is divided into two paradigms: the\nintrinsic paradigm, which believes that only models designed to be explained\ncan be explained, and the post-hoc paradigm, which believes that black-box\nmodels can be explained. At the core of this debate is how each paradigm\nensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior. This\nis important, as false but convincing explanations lead to unsupported\nconfidence in artificial intelligence (AI), which can be dangerous. This\npaper's position is that we should think about new paradigms while staying\nvigilant regarding faithfulness. First, by examining the history of paradigms\nin science, we see that paradigms are constantly evolving. Then, by examining\nthe current paradigms, we can understand their underlying beliefs, the value\nthey bring, and their limitations. Finally, this paper presents 3 emerging\nparadigms for interpretability. The first paradigm designs models such that\nfaithfulness can be easily measured. Another optimizes models such that\nexplanations become faithful. The last paradigm proposes to develop models that\nproduce both a prediction and an explanation.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u5206\u6210\u5169\u7a2e\u5178\u7bc4\uff1a\u5167\u5728\u5178\u7bc4\uff0c\u8a8d\u70ba\u53ea\u6709\u8a2d\u8a08\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u624d\u80fd\u88ab\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e8b\u5f8c\u5178\u7bc4\uff0c\u8a8d\u70ba\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u8faf\u8ad6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6bcf\u500b\u5178\u7bc4\u5982\u4f55\u78ba\u4fdd\u5176\u89e3\u91cb\u662f\u5fe0\u5be6\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u5fe0\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u9019\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u865b\u5047\u4f46\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u5c0d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5371\u96aa\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7acb\u5834\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u61c9\u8a72\u601d\u8003\u65b0\u7684\u5178\u7bc4\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5c0d\u5fe0\u5be6\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u8b66\u60d5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u904e\u6aa2\u8996\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u7684\u5178\u7bc4\u6b77\u53f2\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6703\u770b\u5230\u5178\u7bc4\u4e0d\u65b7\u6f14\u9032\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u901a\u904e\u6aa2\u8996\u7576\u524d\u7684\u5178\u7bc4\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u5b83\u5011\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u548c\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 3 \u500b\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8208\u5178\u7bc4\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5178\u7bc4\u8a2d\u8a08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f15\u9b06\u8861\u91cf\u5fe0\u5be6\u5ea6\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u512a\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u89e3\u91cb\u8b8a\u5f97\u5fe0\u5be6\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u500b\u5178\u7bc4\u63d0\u51fa\u958b\u767c\u540c\u6642\u7522\u751f\u9810\u6e2c\u548c\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Andreas Madsen et.al.", "authors": "Andreas Madsen, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Siva Reddy, Sarath Chandar", "id": "2405.05386v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05386v1", "repo": "null"}}

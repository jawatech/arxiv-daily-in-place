We excluded non-cancer conditions and\nexamined four specific diseases. We assessed four LLMs, BioBERT, XLNet, and\nBERT, as well as a novel base model (Last-BERT). BioBERT, which was pre-trained\non medical data, demonstrated superior performance in medical text\nclassification (97% accuracy). Surprisingly, XLNet followed closely (96%\naccuracy), demonstrating its generalizability across domains even though it was\nnot pre-trained on medical data. LastBERT, a custom model based on the lighter\nversion of BERT, also proved competitive with 87.10% accuracy (just under\nBERT's 89.33%). Our findings confirm the importance of specialized models such\nas BioBERT and also support impressions around more general solutions like\nXLNet and well-tuned transformer architectures with fewer parameters (in this\ncase, LastBERT) in medical domain tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u900f\u904e\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e94\u7a2e\u91ab\u7642\u75be\u75c5\u7684 Medical-Abstracts-TC-Corpus \u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u985e\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u985e\u7684\u6539\u9032\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u975e\u764c\u75c7\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4e26\u6aa2\u67e5\u4e86\u56db\u7a2e\u7279\u5b9a\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u500b LLM\uff0cBioBERT\u3001XLNet \u548c BERT\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b (Last-BERT)\u3002\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u6587\u672c\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7d93\u904e\u91ab\u5b78\u8cc7\u6599\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 BioBERT \u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u512a\u7570\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0897% \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\u7684\u662f\uff0cXLNet \u7dca\u96a8\u5176\u5f8c\uff0896% \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6982\u62ec\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u3002LastBERT \u662f\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u8f03\u8f15\u7248\u672c\u7684 BERT \u7684\u81ea\u8a02\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u7af6\u722d\u529b\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u70ba 87.10%\uff08\u50c5\u4f4e\u65bc BERT \u7684 89.33%\uff09\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u8b49\u5be6\u4e86 BioBERT \u7b49\u5c08\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5c0d\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 XLNet \u548c\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f03\u5c11\u53c3\u6578\u7684\u5fae\u8abfTransformer\u67b6\u69cb\uff08\u5728\u672c\u4f8b\u4e2d\u70ba LastBERT\uff09\u3002", "author": "Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim et.al.", "authors": "Ahmed Akib Jawad Karim, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Aznur Azam", "id": "2411.12712v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12712v1", "repo": "null"}}

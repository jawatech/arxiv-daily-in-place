In this paper,\nwe explore the efficiency and effectiveness of using crowd-sourced truthfulness\nassessments based on condensed, large language model (LLM) generated summaries\nof online sources. We compare the use of generated summaries to the use of\noriginal web pages in an A/B testing setting, where we employ a large and\ndiverse pool of crowd-workers to perform the truthfulness assessment. We\nevaluate the quality of assessments, the efficiency with which assessments are\nperformed, and the behavior and engagement of participants. Our results\ndemonstrate that the Summary modality, which relies on summarized evidence,\noffers no significant change in assessment accuracy over the Standard modality,\nwhile significantly increasing the speed with which assessments are performed.\nWorkers using summarized evidence produce a significantly higher number of\nassessments in the same time frame, reducing the cost needed to acquire\ntruthfulness assessments. Additionally, the Summary modality maximizes both the\ninter-annotator agreements as well as the reliance on and perceived usefulness\nof evidence, demonstrating the utility of summarized evidence without\nsacrificing the quality of assessments.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u96a8\u8457\u7db2\u8def\u9632\u7bc4\u932f\u8aa4\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u8b77\u6b04\u9010\u6f38\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6253\u64ca\u932f\u8aa4\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u4efb\u4f55\u6642\u5019\u90fd\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u751f\u6210\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u4f86\u6e90\u6458\u8981\u7684\u7fa4\u773e\u5916\u5305\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 A/B \u6e2c\u8a66\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u8207\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u7db2\u9801\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4e14\u591a\u5143\u7684\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4f86\u57f7\u884c\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u3001\u57f7\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u53c3\u8207\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6458\u8981\u8b49\u64da\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u8a55\u4f30\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8207\u6a19\u6e96\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u6bd4\u6c92\u6709\u986f\u8457\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57f7\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6458\u8981\u8b49\u64da\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6642\u9593\u5167\u7522\u751f\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u6578\u91cf\u986f\u8457\u8f03\u9ad8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53d6\u5f97\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e86\u6a19\u8a18\u4eba\u54e1\u9593\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u8b49\u64da\u7684\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6458\u8981\u8b49\u64da\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e0d\u72a7\u7272\u8a55\u4f30\u54c1\u8cea\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Kevin Roitero et.al.", "authors": "Kevin Roitero, Dustin Wright, Michael Soprano, Isabelle Augenstein, Stefano Mizzaro", "id": "2501.18265v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18265v1", "repo": "null"}}

To relieve the issues above, this paper proposes Human\nFeedback and Product Consistency (HFPC), which can automatically assess the\ngenerated product images based on two modules. Firstly, to solve inappropriate\nbackgrounds, human feedback on 44,000 automated inpainting product images is\ncollected to train a reward model based on multi-modal features extracted from\nBLIP and comparative learning. Secondly, to filter generated product images\ncontaining inconsistent products, a fine-tuned segmentation model is employed\nto segment the product of the original and generated product images and then\ncompare the differences between the above two. Extensive experiments have\ndemonstrated that HFPC can effectively evaluate the quality of generated\nproduct images and significantly reduce the expense of manual annotation.\nMoreover, HFPC achieves state-of-the-art(96.4% in precision) in comparison to\nother open-source visual-quality-assessment models.

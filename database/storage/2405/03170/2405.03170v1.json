Two\ntypes of checkers are presented. The first type of checker follows the idea of\nproperty testing. The second type of checker follows the idea of program\nchecking. Their applications are demonstrated in two separate contexts, entity\nextraction and paraphrase decision, respectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yueling Jenny Zeng et.al.", "authors": "Yueling Jenny Zeng,Li-C.

We test the GPT-3.5 model on four\nreasoning benchmarks with Chain-of-Thought prompting (and its variations). Our\nresults reveal that despite the amazing performance achieved by large language\nmodels on various reasoning tasks, models still suffer from severe drawbacks\nwhich shows a large gap with humans.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e09\u500b\u65b9\u9762\u6e2c\u8a66\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u9078\u64c7\u548c\u7d44\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u3001\u8655\u7406\u975e\u9806\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u5ee3\u5230\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u8df3\u6578\u7684\u6578\u64da\u6a23\u672c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u56db\u500b\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u6e2c\u8a66 GPT-3.5 \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u93c8\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u53ca\u5176\u8b8a\u9ad4\uff09\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9a5a\u4eba\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u56b4\u91cd\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "author": "Haotong Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Haotong Zhang", "id": "2412.08317v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08317v1", "repo": "null"}}

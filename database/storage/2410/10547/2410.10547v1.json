Handwriting, often affected early in AD, offers a\nnon-invasive and cost-effective way to capture subtle motor changes.\nState-of-the-art research on handwriting, mostly online, based AD detection has\npredominantly relied on manually extracted features, fed as input to shallow\nmachine learning models. Some recent works have proposed deep learning\n(DL)-based models, either 1D-CNN or 2D-CNN architectures, with performance\ncomparing favorably to handcrafted schemes. These approaches, however, overlook\nthe intrinsic relationship between the 2D spatial patterns of handwriting\nstrokes and their 1D dynamic characteristics, thus limiting their capacity to\ncapture the multimodal nature of handwriting data. Moreover, the application of\nTransformer models remains basically unexplored. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel approach for AD detection, consisting of a learnable\nmultimodal hybrid attention model that integrates simultaneously 2D handwriting\nimages with 1D dynamic handwriting signals. Our model leverages a gated\nmechanism to combine similarity and difference attention, blending the two\nmodalities and learning robust features by incorporating information at\ndifferent scales. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on the DARWIN\ndataset, with an F1-score of 90.32\\% and accuracy of 90.91\\% in Task 8 ('L'\nwriting), surpassing the previous best by 4.61% and 6.06% respectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u963f\u8332\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7 (AD) \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u666e\u904d\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u9000\u5316\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u767c\u73fe\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u901a\u5e38\u5728 AD \u65e9\u671f\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7a2e\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u4e14\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f86\u6355\u6349\u7d30\u5fae\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u5728\u7dda\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc AD \u5075\u6e2c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8cf4\u624b\u52d5\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u6dfa\u5c64\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2 (DL) \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec 1D-CNN \u6216 2D-CNN \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u8207\u624b\u5de5\u88fd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f8\u7576\u6709\u5229\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u7b46\u89f8\u7684 2D \u7a7a\u9593\u6a21\u5f0f\u8207\u5176 1D \u52d5\u614b\u7279\u5fb5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5167\u5728\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6355\u6349\u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u8cc7\u6599\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8b8a\u5f62\u91d1\u525b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684 AD \u5075\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u6574\u5408 2D \u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u5f71\u50cf\u8207 1D \u52d5\u614b\u624b\u5beb\u5b57\u8a0a\u865f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u9598\u63a7\u6a5f\u5236\u7d50\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u7570\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u6a21\u614b\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u7d0d\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u898f\u6a21\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u7a69\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 DARWIN \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52d9 8\uff08\u300cL\u300d\u66f8\u5beb\uff09\u4e2d F1 \u5206\u6578\u70ba 90.32%\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u70ba 90.91%\uff0c\u5206\u5225\u6bd4\u524d\u4e00\u500b\u6700\u4f73\u7d50\u679c\u9ad8\u51fa 4.61% \u548c 6.06%\u3002", "author": "Changqing Gong et.al.", "authors": "Changqing Gong, Huafeng Qin, Moun\u00eem A.

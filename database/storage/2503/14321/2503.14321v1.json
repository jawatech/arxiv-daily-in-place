{"2503.14321": {"publish_time": "2025-03-18", "title": "COPA: Comparing the Incomparable to Explore the Pareto Front", "paper_summary": "In machine learning (ML), it is common to account for multiple objectives\nwhen, e.g., selecting a model to deploy. However, it is often unclear how one\nshould compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, as they\nmight be measured in different units or scales. For example, when deploying\nlarge language models (LLMs), we might not only care about their performance,\nbut also their CO2 consumption. In this work, we investigate how objectives can\nbe sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front. To do so,\nwe propose to make incomparable objectives comparable via their CDFs,\napproximated by their relative rankings. This allows us to aggregate them while\nmatching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully\nnavigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the\npotential impact of our methodology in diverse areas such as LLM selection,\ndomain generalization, and AutoML benchmarking, where classical ways to\naggregate and normalize objectives fail.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u4e2d\uff0c\u7576\u4f8b\u5982\u9078\u64c7\u8981\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6642\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u8003\u616e\u591a\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u61c9\u8a72\u5982\u4f55\u6bd4\u8f03\u3001\u5f59\u7e3d\uff0c\u6700\u7d42\u6b0a\u8861\u9019\u4e9b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u55ae\u4f4d\u6216\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f86\u8861\u91cf\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u50c5\u95dc\u5fc3\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u9084\u95dc\u5fc3\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6d88\u8017\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u5730\u6bd4\u8f03\u548c\u5f59\u7e3d\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u4ee5\u700f\u89bd\u5176\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u901a\u904e\u5b83\u5011\u7684 CDF\uff08\u7d2f\u7a4d\u5206\u4f48\u51fd\u6578\uff09\u4f7f\u7121\u53ef\u6bd4\u64ec\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u901a\u904e\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u76f8\u5c0d\u6392\u540d\u4f86\u8fd1\u4f3c CDF\u3002\u9019\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u5339\u914d\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u540c\u6642\u5f59\u7e3d\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f9e\u696d\u8005\u80fd\u5920\u6709\u610f\u7fa9\u5730\u700f\u89bd\u548c\u641c\u5c0b\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 LLM \u9078\u64c7\u3001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c AutoML \u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u9818\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u5f59\u7e3d\u548c\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5931\u6557\u4e86\u3002\n", "author": "Adri\u00e1n Javaloy et.al.", "authors": "Adri\u00e1n Javaloy, Antonio Vergari, Isabel Valera", "id": "2503.14321v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14321v1", "repo": "null"}}

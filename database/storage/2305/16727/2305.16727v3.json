The accurate detection and classification of cardiac arrhythmias\nare pivotal for diagnosing individuals with heart irregularities. This study\nunderscores the feasibility of employing electrocardiograms (ECG) measurements\nin the home environment for real-time arrhythmia detection. Presenting a fresh\napplication for arrhythmia detection, this paper leverages the cutting-edge\nYou-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v8 algorithm to categorize single-lead ECG signals. We\nintroduce a novel loss-modified YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned on the MIT-BIH\narrhythmia dataset, enabling real-time continuous monitoring. The obtained\nresults substantiate the efficacy of our approach, with the model attaining an\naverage accuracy of 99.5% and 0.992 mAP@50, and a rapid detection time of 0.002\nseconds on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. Our investigation exemplifies the potential of\nreal-time arrhythmia detection, enabling users to visually interpret the model\noutput within the comfort of their homes. Furthermore, this study lays the\ngroundwork for an extension into a real-time explainable AI (XAI) model capable\nof deployment in the healthcare sector, thereby significantly advancing the\nrealm of healthcare solutions.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Guang Jun Nicholas Ang et.al.", "authors": "Guang Jun Nicholas Ang,Aritejh Kr Goil,Henryk Chan,Jieyi Jeric Lew,Xin Chun Lee,Raihan Bin Ahmad Mustaffa,Timotius Jason,Ze Ting Woon,Bingquan Shen", "id": "2305.16727v3", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16727v3", "repo": "null"}}

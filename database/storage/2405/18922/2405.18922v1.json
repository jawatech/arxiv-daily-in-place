However, under-translation and over-translation remain two challenging\nproblems in state-of-the-art NMT systems. In this work, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis on the underlying cause of under-translation in NMT, providing an\nexplanation from the perspective of decoding objective. To optimize the beam\nsearch objective, the model tends to overlook words it is less confident about,\nleading to the under-translation phenomenon. Correspondingly, the model's\nconfidence in predicting the End Of Sentence (EOS) diminishes when\nunder-translation occurs, serving as a mild penalty for under-translated\ncandidates. Building upon this analysis, we propose employing the confidence of\npredicting EOS as a detector for under-translation, and strengthening the\nconfidence-based penalty to penalize candidates with a high risk of\nunder-translation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that\nour method can accurately detect and rectify under-translated outputs, with\nminor impact on other correct translations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u795e\u7d93\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f (NMT) \u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u53d6\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8b6f\u6f0f\u548c\u8b6f\u904e\u982d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u73fe\u4eca\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 NMT \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u5169\u500b\u6311\u6230\u6027\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e NMT \u4e2d\u8b6f\u6f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e26\u5f9e\u89e3\u78bc\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u5c0b\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u5ffd\u7565\u5b83\u8f03\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u7684\u5b57\u8a5e\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u8b6f\u6f0f\u73fe\u8c61\u3002\u76f8\u5c0d\u61c9\u5730\uff0c\u7576\u8b6f\u6f0f\u767c\u751f\u6642\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u53e5\u5b50\u7d50\u675f (EOS) \u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6703\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u8b6f\u6f0f\u5019\u9078\u9805\u7684\u8f15\u5fae\u61f2\u7f70\u3002\u6839\u64da\u6b64\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u4f7f\u7528\u9810\u6e2c EOS \u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4f5c\u70ba\u8b6f\u6f0f\u7684\u5075\u6e2c\u5668\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u5316\u57fa\u65bc\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u61f2\u7f70\uff0c\u4ee5\u61f2\u7f70\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8b6f\u6f0f\u98a8\u96aa\u7684\u5019\u9078\u9805\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u8b6f\u6f0f\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\uff0c\u5c0d\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u78ba\u7ffb\u8b6f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "author": "Chenze Shao et.al.", "authors": "Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jiali Zeng, Jie Zhou", "id": "2405.18922v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18922v1", "repo": "null"}}

While effective for tasks in widely spoken languages\nlike English, generative large language models (LLMs) typically underperform\nwith less common languages and can pose potential risks to patient privacy.\nFine-tuning local NLP models is hindered by the skewed nature of real-world\nmedical datasets, where rare findings represent a significant data imbalance.\nWe introduce SMP-BERT, a novel prompt learning method that leverages the\nstructured nature of reports to overcome these challenges. In our studies\ninvolving a substantial collection of Crohn's disease radiology reports in\nHebrew (over 8,000 patients and 10,000 reports), SMP-BERT greatly surpassed\ntraditional fine-tuning methods in performance, notably in detecting infrequent\nconditions (AUC: 0.99 vs 0.94, F1: 0.84 vs 0.34). SMP-BERT empowers more\naccurate AI diagnostics available for low-resource languages.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Liam Hazan et.al.", "authors": "Liam Hazan,Gili Focht,Naama Gavrielov,Roi Reichart,Talar Hagopian,Mary-Louise C.

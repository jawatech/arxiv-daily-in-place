As far as the graph modality goes, however, no such\nassistants have yet been developed. Graph structures are complex in that they\nrepresent relation between different features and are permutation invariant.\nMoreover, representing them in purely textual form does not always lead to good\nLLM performance even for finetuned models. As a result, there is a need to\ndevelop a new method to integrate graphs in LLMs for general graph\nunderstanding. This work explores the integration of the graph modality in LLM\nfor general graph instruction following tasks. It aims at producing a deep\nlearning model that enhances an underlying LLM with graph embeddings and trains\nit to understand them and to produce, given an instruction, an answer grounded\nin the graph representation. The approach performs significantly better than a\ngraph to text approach and remains consistent even for larger graphs.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u6587\u5b57\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8277\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u4e26\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u5efa\u69cb\u667a\u6167\u52a9\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u539f\u672c\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e2d\u5df2\u900f\u904e\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u529f\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u52a0\u5f37\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u69cb\u51fa\u8996\u89ba\u6307\u4ee4\u8ffd\u8e64\u52a9\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c31\u5716\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u6b64\u985e\u52a9\u7406\u3002\u5716\u5f62\u7d50\u69cb\u5f88\u8907\u96dc\uff0c\u5728\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5fb5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u8b8a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0d\u65bc\u5fae\u8abf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u8868\u793a\u6210\u7d14\u7cb9\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e26\u975e\u7e3d\u662f\u80fd\u5e36\u4f86\u826f\u597d\u7684 LLM \u6548\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u958b\u767c\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07\u5716\u5f62\u6574\u5408\u5230 LLM \u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e LLM \u4e2d\u5716\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u6307\u4ee4\u8ffd\u8e64\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u5176\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u500b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5716\u5f62\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f37\u57fa\u790e LLM\uff0c\u4e26\u8a13\u7df4\u5b83\u4e86\u89e3\u5716\u5f62\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u6839\u64da\u6307\u4ee4\u7522\u751f\u4ee5\u5716\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u6587\u5b57\u5230\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0d\u65bc\u8f03\u5927\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "author": "Vlad Argatu et.al.", "authors": "Vlad Argatu, Aaron Haag, Oliver Lohse", "id": "2405.20684v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20684v1", "repo": "null"}}

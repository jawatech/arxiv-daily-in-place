We observe that papers published in different NLP\nvenues show different patterns related to artefact reuse. We also note that\nmore than 30% of the papers we analysed do not release their artefacts\npublicly, despite promising to do so. Further, we observe a wide language-wise\ndisparity in publicly available NLP-related artefacts.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5132\u5b58\u5728 ACL Anthology \u4e2d\u7684 NLP \u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u6587\u6a23\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5617\u8a66\u91cf\u5316 NLP \u793e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u958b\u653e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u9019\u7a2e\u958b\u653e\u6587\u5316\u7684\u597d\u8655\u3002\u6211\u5011\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u4e0d\u540c NLP \u5834\u6240\u767c\u8868\u7684\u8ad6\u6587\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u8207\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u518d\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u627f\u8afe\u516c\u958b\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8ad6\u6587\u4e2d\u8d85\u904e 30% \u6c92\u6709\u516c\u958b\u5176\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u516c\u958b\u53ef\u7528\u7684 NLP \u76f8\u95dc\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u5dee\u7570\u3002", "author": "Surangika Ranathunga et.al.", "authors": "Surangika Ranathunga, Nisansa de Silva, Dilith Jayakody, Aloka Fernando", "id": "2406.06021v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06021v1", "repo": "null"}}

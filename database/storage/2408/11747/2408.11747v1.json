However, these\nmethods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the\nautonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem\ntermed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the\nnecessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a\ncomprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and\nleveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of\nour OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the\nsemantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class\nnames, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++\ndatasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the\ncurrent state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth\nobject class names.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u958b\u653e\u8a5e\u5f59 3D \u5be6\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5 (OV-3DIS) \u6700\u8fd1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u6982\u62ec\u5230\u672a\u898b\u7269\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e2c\u8a66\u671f\u9593\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u985e\u5225\u540d\u7a31\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u958b\u653e\u5f0f 3D \u5be6\u4f8b\u5206\u5272 (OE-3DIS)\uff0c\u5b83\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6e2c\u8a66\u671f\u9593\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9\u985e\u5225\u540d\u7a31\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8ca2\u737b\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u5f9e OV-3DIS \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u884d\u751f\u4e26\u5229\u7528 2D \u591a\u6a21\u614b\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u57fa\u7dda\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8a55\u4f30\u6211\u5011\u7684 OE-3DIS \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u958b\u653e\u5f0f\u8a55\u5206\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6a19\u6e96 AP \u8a55\u5206\u5916\uff0c\u9084\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u9810\u6e2c\u906e\u7f69\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u95dc\u985e\u5225\u540d\u7a31\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u548c\u5e7e\u4f55\u54c1\u8cea\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5728 ScanNet200 \u548c ScanNet++ \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u57fa\u7dda\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86 Open3DIS \u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0cOpen3DIS \u662f OV-3DIS \u4e2d\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6c92\u6709 ground-truth \u7269\u4ef6\u985e\u5225\u540d\u7a31\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002", "author": "Phuc D.

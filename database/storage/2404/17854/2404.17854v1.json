However, the\ninherent inductive biases in convolutional architectures limit their ability to\nmodel long-range dependencies and spatial correlations. While recent\ntransformer-based architectures address these limitations by leveraging\nself-attention mechanisms to encode long-range dependencies and learn\nexpressive representations, they often struggle to extract low-level features\nand are highly dependent on data availability. This motivated us for the\ndevelopment of GLIMS, a data-efficient attention-guided hybrid volumetric\nsegmentation network. GLIMS utilizes Dilated Feature Aggregator Convolutional\nBlocks (DACB) to capture local-global feature correlations efficiently.\nFurthermore, the incorporated Swin Transformer-based bottleneck bridges the\nlocal and global features to improve the robustness of the model. Additionally,\nGLIMS employs an attention-guided segmentation approach through Channel and\nSpatial-Wise Attention Blocks (CSAB) to localize expressive features for\nfine-grained border segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results on\nglioblastoma and multi-organ CT segmentation tasks demonstrate GLIMS'\neffectiveness in terms of complexity and accuracy. GLIMS demonstrated\noutstanding performance on BraTS2021 and BTCV datasets, surpassing the\nperformance of Swin UNETR. Notably, GLIMS achieved this high performance with a\nsignificantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Specifically, GLIMS has\n47.16M trainable parameters and 72.30G FLOPs, while Swin UNETR has 61.98M\ntrainable parameters and 394.84G FLOPs.

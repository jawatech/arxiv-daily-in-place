Our system leverages readily available MEDIQA-M3G images via a\nVGG16-CNN-SVM model, enabling multilingual (English, Chinese, Spanish) learning\nof informative skin condition representations. Using pre-trained QA models, we\nfurther bridge the gap between visual and textual information through\nmultimodal fusion. This approach tackles complex, open-ended questions even\nwithout predefined answer choices. We empower the generation of comprehensive\nanswers by feeding the ViT-CLIP model with multiple responses alongside images.\nThis work advances medical QA research, paving the way for clinical decision\nsupport systems and ultimately improving healthcare delivery.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Nadia Saeed et.al.", "authors": "Nadia Saeed", "id": "2405.01583v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01583v1", "repo": "null"}}

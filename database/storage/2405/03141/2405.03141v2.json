However,\nthe frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge\ndue to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been\nvalidated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis\nassessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out\nmanually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic\nsystem that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this\nend, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle\n(UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate\nlandmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An\naffinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area\nto illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks.\nSubsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered\naffinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for\nUCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for\nlandmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic\nUCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can\npotentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yihao Zhou et.al.", "authors": "Yihao Zhou,Timothy Tin-Yan Lee,Kelly Ka-Lee Lai,Chonglin Wu,Hin Ting Lau,De Yang,Chui-Yi Chan,Winnie Chiu-Wing Chu,Jack Chun-Yiu Cheng,Tsz-Ping Lam,Yong-Ping Zheng", "id": "2405.03141v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03141v2", "repo": "null"}}

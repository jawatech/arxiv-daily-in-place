There are different variants\nthat differ not only in terms of the type of rankings that are used as input\nand output, but also in terms of the objective function employed to evaluate\nthe quality of the desired output ranking. In contrast, in some machine\nlearning tasks (e.g. subgroup discovery) or multimodal optimization tasks,\nattention is devoted to obtaining several models/results to account for the\ndiversity in the input data or across the search landscape. Thus, in this paper\nwe propose to provide, as the solution to an RAP, a set of rankings to better\nexplain the preferences expressed in the input orderings. We exemplify our\nproposal through the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), an RAP which consists\nin finding a single consensus ranking (with ties) that generalizes a set of\ninput rankings codified as a precedence matrix. To address this, we introduce\nthe Optimal Set of Bucket Orders Problem (OSBOP), a generalization of the OBOP\nthat aims to produce not a single ranking as output but a set of consensus\nrankings. Experimental results are presented to illustrate this proposal,\nshowing how, by providing a set of consensus rankings, the fitness of the\nsolution significantly improves with respect to the one of the original OBOP,\nwithout losing comprehensibility.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u7b49\u7d1a\u5f59\u7e3d\u554f\u984c (RAP) \u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5171\u8b58\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u6982\u62ec\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u8f38\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8b8a\u9ad4\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5dee\u7570\u4e0d\u50c5\u5728\u65bc\u7528\u4f5c\u8f38\u5165\u548c\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u6392\u540d\u985e\u578b\uff0c\u9084\u5728\u65bc\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u8f38\u51fa\u6392\u540d\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u51fd\u6578\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4efb\u52d9\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5b50\u7fa4\u767c\u73fe\uff09\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u512a\u5316\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u65bc\u7372\u5f97\u591a\u500b\u6a21\u578b/\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8aaa\u660e\u8f38\u5165\u6578\u64da\u6216\u641c\u7d22\u7bc4\u570d\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7d44\u6392\u540d\u4f5c\u70ba RAP \u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91cb\u8f38\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u8868\u9054\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u6700\u4f73\u6876\u5e8f\u554f\u984c (OBOP) \u4f86\u4f8b\u8b49\u6211\u5011\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0cOBOP \u662f\u4e00\u500b RAP\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u55ae\u4e00\u7684\u5171\u8b58\u6392\u540d\uff08\u5e36\u6709\u806f\u7e6b\uff09\uff0c\u6982\u62ec\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u7de8\u78bc\u70ba\u512a\u5148\u77e9\u9663\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u6392\u540d\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6876\u5e8f\u554f\u984c\u96c6 (OSBOP)\uff0c\u9019\u662f OBOP \u7684\u4e00\u500b\u6982\u62ec\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4e0d\u7522\u751f\u55ae\u4e00\u7684\u6392\u540d\u4f5c\u70ba\u8f38\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7522\u751f\u4e00\u7d44\u5171\u8b58\u6392\u540d\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u4f86\u8aaa\u660e\u9019\u500b\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u904e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7d44\u5171\u8b58\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u5c0d\u65bc\u539f\u59cb OBOP \u7684\u9069\u61c9\u5ea6\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6703\u5931\u53bb\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "author": "Juan A.

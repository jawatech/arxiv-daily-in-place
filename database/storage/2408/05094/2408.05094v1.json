Our approach is\nverified to be superior to previous methods in obtaining a well-distributed\nPareto front among different alignment objectives.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u5c0d\u9f4a\u4efb\u52d9\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5c0d\u9f4a\u76ee\u6a19\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3001\u7121\u5bb3\u6027\u548c\u8aa0\u5be6\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6eff\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u500b\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u591a\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u5404\u7a2e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6578\u91cf\u6703\u96a8\u8457\u5c0d\u9f4a\u76ee\u6a19\u6578\u91cf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u6578\u91cf\u7dda\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u91dd\u5c0d\u6bcf\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u5c0d\u9f4a\u76ee\u6a19\u9032\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\n\u8003\u616e\u5230\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 MCA\uff08\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5f0f\u5c0d\u9f4a\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u70ba\u6bcf\u500b\u76ee\u6a19\u5efa\u69cb\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u89e3\u78bc\u6642\u9032\u884c\u5c0d\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u7d50\u5408\u5c0d\u6bd4\u4f86\u5e73\u8861\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u88ab\u9a57\u8b49\u70ba\u512a\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c0d\u9f4a\u76ee\u6a19\u4e4b\u9593\u7372\u5f97\u5206\u4f48\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u7de3\u3002", "author": "Tingchen Fu et.al.", "authors": "Tingchen Fu, Yupeng Hou, Julian McAuley, Rui Yan", "id": "2408.05094v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05094v1", "repo": "null"}}

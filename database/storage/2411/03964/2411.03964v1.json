However, there are debates on the\ngenuineness of commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In specific, a significant\nportion of instances in some commonsense benchmarks do not concern commonsense\nknowledge. That problem would undermine the measurement of the true commonsense\nreasoning ability of evaluated models. It is also suggested that the problem\noriginated from a blurry concept of commonsense knowledge, as distinguished\nfrom other types of knowledge. To demystify all of the above claims, in this\nstudy, we survey existing definitions of commonsense knowledge, ground into the\nthree frameworks for defining concepts, and consolidate them into a\nmulti-framework unified definition of commonsense knowledge (so-called\nconsolidated definition). We then use the consolidated definition for\nannotations and experiments on the CommonsenseQA and CommonsenseQA 2.0 datasets\nto examine the above claims. Our study shows that there exists a large portion\nof non-commonsense-knowledge instances in the two datasets, and a large\nperformance gap on these two subsets where Large Language Models (LLMs) perform\nworse on commonsense-knowledge instances.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5e38\u8bc6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f17\u5305\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bba\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e76\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5c06\u635f\u5bb3\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u533a\u522b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63ed\u5f00\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6240\u6709\u8bf4\u6cd5\u7684\u795e\u79d8\u9762\u7eb1\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\uff08\u5373\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 CommonsenseQA \u548c CommonsenseQA 2.0 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8bf4\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "author": "Quyet V.

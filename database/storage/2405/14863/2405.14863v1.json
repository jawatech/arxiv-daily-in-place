For example, ``If a \\textit{doctor} were a \\textit{color},\nwhat color would it be?''. This seemingly peculiar task is designed to\ninvestigate how people represent concrete and abstract concepts through their\nmappings between categories and their reasoning processes over those mappings.\nIn this paper, we adapt this task from cognitive science to evaluate the\nconceptualization and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs)\nthrough a behavioral study. We examine several LLMs by prompting them with a\ncross-domain mapping task and analyzing their responses at both the population\nand individual levels. Additionally, we assess the models' ability to reason\nabout their predictions by analyzing and categorizing their explanations for\nthese mappings. The results reveal several similarities between humans' and\nmodels' mappings and explanations, suggesting that models represent concepts\nsimilarly to humans. This similarity is evident not only in the model\nrepresentation but also in their behavior. Furthermore, the models mostly\nprovide valid explanations and deploy reasoning paths that are similar to those\nof humans.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u6bd4\u5c0d\u662f\u6307\u5c07\u4e00\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5c0d\u61c9\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\u300c\u5982\u679c\u300e\u91ab\u751f\u300f\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u300e\u984f\u8272\u300f\uff0c\u5b83\u6703\u662f\u4ec0\u9ebc\u984f\u8272\uff1f\u300d\u3002\u9019\u500b\u770b\u4f3c\u5947\u602a\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8a0e\u4eba\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u900f\u904e\u985e\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5c0d\u61c9\u548c\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f86\u8868\u793a\u5177\u9ad4\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u8a8d\u77e5\u79d1\u5b78\u4e2d\u6539\u7de8\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u884c\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u63d0\u793a LLM \u9032\u884c\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u6bd4\u5c0d\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u65cf\u7fa4\u548c\u500b\u4eba\u5c64\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u4f86\u6aa2\u8996\u591a\u500b LLM\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u985e\u9019\u4e9b\u6bd4\u5c0d\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5176\u9810\u6e2c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u4eba\u985e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u5c0d\u548c\u89e3\u91cb\u4e4b\u9593\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e4b\u8655\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u985e\u4f3c\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f86\u8868\u793a\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0d\u50c5\u8868\u73fe\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e5f\u8868\u73fe\u5728\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u4e0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4e26\u63a1\u7528\u985e\u4f3c\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f91\u3002", "author": "Asaf Yehudai et.al.", "authors": "Asaf Yehudai, Taelin Karidi, Gabriel Stanovsky, Ariel Goldstein, Omri Abend", "id": "2405.14863v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14863v1", "repo": "null"}}

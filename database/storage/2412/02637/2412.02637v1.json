We describe our bespoke approaches to\ntime-binning, community clustering, and connecting communities over time, as\nwell as our adaptation of state-of-the-art approaches to semantic change\ndetection and semantic leadership induction. We find substantial evidence of\nthe leadership role of BLM activists and progressives, as well as Black\ncelebrities. We also find evidence of the sustained engagement of the\nconservative community with this discourse, suggesting an alternative\nexplanation for how we arrived at the present moment, in which \"anti-woke\" and\n\"anti-CRT\" bills are being enacted nationwide.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u9019\u500b\u5c08\u6848\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u8de8\u8d8a\u8207 #BlackLivesMatter \u904b\u52d5\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\u5efa\u6a21\u8a9e\u610f\u9818\u5c0e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u7d50\u69cb\u548c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u9ed1\u4eba\u63a8\u7279\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u6642\u9593\u5206\u7d44\u3001\u793e\u7fa4\u5206\u7fa4\u548c\u793e\u7fa4\u96a8\u8457\u6642\u9593\u63a8\u79fb\u7684\u9023\u63a5\u7684\u5ba2\u88fd\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u8a9e\u610f\u8b8a\u66f4\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u8a9e\u610f\u9818\u5c0e\u6b78\u7d0d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u7de8\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u4e86 BLM \u884c\u52d5\u8005\u548c\u9032\u6b65\u4e3b\u7fa9\u8005\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ed1\u4eba\u540d\u4eba\u9818\u5c0e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5be6\u8cea\u8b49\u64da\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u767c\u73fe\u4fdd\u5b88\u793e\u7fa4\u6301\u7e8c\u53c3\u8207\u9019\u5834\u8ad6\u8ff0\u7684\u8b49\u64da\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u6211\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u5230\u9054\u73fe\u5728\u7684\u6642\u523b\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u7a2e\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u300c\u53cd\u89ba\u9192\u300d\u548c\u300c\u53cd CRT\u300d\u6cd5\u6848\u6b63\u5728\u5168\u570b\u5404\u5730\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "author": "Dani Roytburg et.al.", "authors": "Dani Roytburg, Deborah Olorunisola, Sandeep Soni, Lauren Klein", "id": "2412.02637v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02637v1", "repo": "null"}}

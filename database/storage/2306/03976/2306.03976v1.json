Potential\napplications include credit scoring and diagnosis of medical conditions. The\nBoolean formula defines a rule with tunable complexity (or interpretability),\naccording to which input data are classified. Such a formula can include any\noperator that can be applied to one or more Boolean variables, thus providing\nhigher expressivity compared to more rigid rule-based and tree-based\napproaches. The classifier is trained using native local optimization\ntechniques, efficiently searching the space of feasible formulas. Shallow rules\ncan be determined by fast Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers, potentially powered by\nspecial purpose hardware or quantum devices. We combine the expressivity and\nefficiency of the native local optimizer with the fast operation of these\ndevices by executing non-local moves that optimize over subtrees of the full\nBoolean formula. We provide extensive numerical benchmarking results featuring\nseveral baselines on well-known public datasets. Based on the results, we find\nthat the native local rule classifier is generally competitive with the other\nclassifiers. The addition of non-local moves achieves similar results with\nfewer iterations, and therefore using specialized or quantum hardware could\nlead to a speedup by fast proposal of non-local moves.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Gili Rosenberg et.al.", "authors": "Gili Rosenberg,J.

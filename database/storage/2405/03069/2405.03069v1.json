(2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of\ncausation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning\n(specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as\ndifficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its\nmerely probabilistic or \"correlational\" counterpart. Introducing a summation\noperator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the\n$do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of\nmarginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier\ncomplexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization.\nWe complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of\nprobabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these\nagain remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for\nrandom variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the\nranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these\nlanguages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving\nopen questions posed by Ibeling et al.

There are multiple adverse effects, impacting the health and\nwell-being of the citizens. Small scale interventions, e.g. pocket parks, is a\nviable solution, but comes with multiple constraints, involving the design and\nimplementation over a specific area. In this study, we harness the capabilities\nof generative AI for multi-scale intervention planning, focusing on nature\nbased solutions. By leveraging image-to-image and image inpainting algorithms,\nwe propose a methodology to address the green space deficit in urban areas.\nFocusing on two alleys in Thessaloniki, where greenery is lacking, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach in visualizing NBS interventions. Our\nfindings underscore the transformative potential of emerging technologies in\nshaping the future of urban intervention planning processes.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Ioannis Kavouras et.al.", "authors": "Ioannis Kavouras,Ioannis Rallis,Emmanuel Sardis,Eftychios Protopapadakis,Anastasios Doulamis,Nikolaos Doulamis", "id": "2404.15492v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15492v1", "repo": "null"}}

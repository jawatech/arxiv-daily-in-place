These methods attempt to improve\naccuracy by introducing new modules or integrating traditional methods.\nHowever, the improvements are only modest. In this paper, we propose a novel\nstrategy by incorporating knowledge distillation and model pruning to overcome\nthe inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy. As a result, we obtained a\nmodel that maintains real-time performance while delivering high accuracy on\nedge devices. Our proposed method involves three key steps. Firstly, we review\nstate-of-the-art methods and design our lightweight model by removing redundant\nmodules from those efficient models through a comparison of their\ncontributions. Next, we leverage the efficient model as the teacher to distill\nknowledge into the lightweight model. Finally, we systematically prune the\nlightweight model to obtain the final model. Through extensive experiments\nconducted on two widely-used benchmarks, Sceneflow and KITTI, we perform\nablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of each module and present our\nstate-of-the-art results.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u96d6\u7136\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u5373\u6642\u7acb\u9ad4\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5617\u8a66\u900f\u904e\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u7d44\u6216\u6574\u5408\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u63d0\u5347\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7d50\u5408\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6b0a\u8861\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5728\u908a\u7de3\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7dad\u6301\u5373\u6642\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u6b65\u9a5f\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u56de\u9867\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u6bd4\u8f03\u5176\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u5f9e\u90a3\u4e9b\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u591a\u9918\u7684\u6a21\u7d44\u4f86\u8a2d\u8a08\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8f15\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u70ba\u6559\u5e2b\uff0c\u5c07\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\u5230\u8f15\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u526a\u679d\u8f15\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7372\u5f97\u6700\u7d42\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5169\u500b\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u6e96 Sceneflow \u548c KITTI \u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u500b\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u6211\u5011\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "author": "Baiyu Pan et.al.", "authors": "Baiyu Pan, Jichao Jiao, Jianxing Pang, Jun Cheng", "id": "2405.11809v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11809v1", "repo": "null"}}

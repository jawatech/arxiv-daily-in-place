Our novel framework, Medical\nDecision-making Agents (MDAgents) aims to address this gap by automatically\nassigning the effective collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or\ngroup collaboration structure is tailored to the complexity of the medical task\nat hand, emulating real-world medical decision making processes. We evaluate\nour framework and baseline methods with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of\nchallenging medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA,\nPath-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best performance in 5 out of 7 benchmarks\nthat require an understanding of multi-modal medical reasoning. Ablation\nstudies reveal that MDAgents excels in adapting the number of collaborating\nagents to optimize efficiency and accuracy, showcasing its robustness in\ndiverse scenarios. We also explore the dynamics of group consensus, offering\ninsights into how collaborative agents could behave in complex clinical team\ndynamics.

Typically, the process involves\nsegmenting the entire volume, which can be unnecessary when the points of\ninterest are limited. In those cases, a classifier could be used instead of\nsegmentation. However, there is an inherent trade-off between the context size\nand the speed of classifiers. To address this issue, we propose a new method\nthat employs a data selection strategy with sparse sampling across a wide field\nof view without image resampling. This sparse sampling strategy makes it\npossible to classify voxels into multiple organs in real time without using\naccelerators. Although our method is an independent classifier, it can generate\nfull segmentation by querying grid locations at any resolution. We have\ncompared our method with existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating its\npotential for superior runtime in practical applications in medical imaging.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Halid Ziya Yerebakan et.al.", "authors": "Halid Ziya Yerebakan,Yoshihisa Shinagawa,Gerardo Hermosillo Valadez", "id": "2404.18731v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18731v1", "repo": "null"}}

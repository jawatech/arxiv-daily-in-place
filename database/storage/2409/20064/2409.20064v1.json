Unsupervised\nCognition is a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that focus on modelling\nthe learned data. This paper presents three techniques to perform knowledge\ndiscovery over an already trained Unsupervised Cognition model. Specifically,\nwe present a technique for pattern mining, a technique for feature selection\nbased on the previous pattern mining technique, and a technique for\ndimensionality reduction based on the previous feature selection technique. The\nfinal goal is to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant features and use\nthem to build a model from which to extract meaningful patterns. We evaluated\nour proposals with empirical experiments and found that they overcome the\nstate-of-the-art in knowledge discovery.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u767c\u73fe\u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u8a6e\u91cb\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u95dc\u9375\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u627e\u51fa\u5176\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u8a8d\u77e5\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5c0d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7a2e\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c0d\u5df2\u8a13\u7df4\u597d\u7684\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u8a8d\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u57f7\u884c\u77e5\u8b58\u767c\u73fe\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u52d8\u6280\u8853\u3001\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u52d8\u6280\u8853\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u9078\u53d6\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7279\u5fb5\u9078\u53d6\u6280\u8853\u7684\u964d\u7dad\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u5340\u5206\u76f8\u95dc\u548c\u7121\u95dc\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u5011\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u7d93\u9a57\u5be6\u9a57\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u5b83\u5011\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u77e5\u8b58\u767c\u73fe\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3002", "author": "Alfredo Ibias et.al.", "authors": "Alfredo Ibias, Hector Antona, Guillem Ramirez-Miranda, Enric Guinovart", "id": "2409.20064v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20064v1", "repo": "null"}}

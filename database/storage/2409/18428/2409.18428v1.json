In this\npaper, we present a simple and effective N-best re-ranking approach to improve\nmultilingual ASR accuracy for several prominent acoustic models by employing\nexternal features such as language models and text-based language\nidentification models. Our results on FLEURS using the MMS and Whisper models\nshow spoken language identification accuracy improvements of 8.7% and 6.1%,\nrespectively and word error rates which are 3.3% and 2.0% lower on these\nbenchmarks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8b58\u5225 (ASR) \u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u8a9e\u97f3\u8a71\u8a9e\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u8a9e\u8a00\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u591a\u6578\u5be6\u969b\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u4e26\u975e\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u81ea\u52d5\u53e3\u8aaa\u8a9e\u8a00\u8fa8\u8b58 (SLID) \u6a21\u578b\u4e26\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e14\u932f\u8aa4\u5206\u985e\u6703\u5c0d\u6700\u7d42\u7684 ASR \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u9020\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u63a1\u7528\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u8fa8\u8b58\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u5c0d\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00 ASR \u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u9032\u884c N-best \u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 FLEURS \u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528 MMS \u548c Whisper \u6a21\u578b\u6240\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u53e3\u8aaa\u8a9e\u8a00\u8fa8\u8b58\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5206\u5225\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 8.7% \u548c 6.1%\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u7684\u5b57\u5143\u932f\u8aa4\u7387\u5247\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 3.3% \u548c 2.0%\u3002", "author": "Brian Yan et.al.", "authors": "Brian Yan, Vineel Pratap, Shinji Watanabe, Michael Auli", "id": "2409.18428v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18428v1", "repo": "null"}}

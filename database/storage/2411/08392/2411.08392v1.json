{"2411.08392": {"publish_time": "2024-11-13", "title": "RLInspect: An Interactive Visual Approach to Assess Reinforcement Learning Algorithm", "paper_summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a rapidly growing area of machine learning\nthat finds its application in a broad range of domains, from finance and\nhealthcare to robotics and gaming. Compared to other machine learning\ntechniques, RL agents learn from their own experiences using trial and error,\nand improve their performance over time. However, assessing RL models can be\nchallenging, which makes it difficult to interpret their behaviour. While\nreward is a widely used metric to evaluate RL models, it may not always provide\nan accurate measure of training performance. In some cases, the reward may seem\nincreasing while the model's performance is actually decreasing, leading to\nmisleading conclusions about the effectiveness of the training. To overcome\nthis limitation, we have developed RLInspect - an interactive visual analytic\ntool, that takes into account different components of the RL model - state,\naction, agent architecture and reward, and provides a more comprehensive view\nof the RL training. By using RLInspect, users can gain insights into the\nmodel's behaviour, identify issues during training, and potentially correct\nthem effectively, leading to a more robust and reliable RL system.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u662f\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5feb\u901f\u6210\u9577\u7684\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u5f9e\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u5230\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u904a\u6232\u3002\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRL \u4ee3\u7406\u5f9e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7d93\u9a57\u4e2d\u900f\u904e\u5617\u8a66\u548c\u932f\u8aa4\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4e26\u96a8\u8457\u6642\u9593\u63a8\u79fb\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8a55\u4f30 RL \u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u96e3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91cb\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u734e\u52f5\u662f\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30 RL \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4e26\u4e0d\u7e3d\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u8861\u91cf\u6a19\u6e96\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u734e\u52f5\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u4f3c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u6b63\u5728\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u5c0d\u8a13\u7df4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8aa4\u5c0e\u6027\u7d50\u8ad6\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u9019\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86 RLInspect\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u8996\u89ba\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b83\u8003\u616e\u4e86 RL \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u72c0\u614b\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u69cb\u548c\u734e\u52f5\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 RL \u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6aa2\u8996\u3002\u900f\u904e\u4f7f\u7528 RLInspect\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u627e\u51fa\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e26\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fee\u6b63\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684 RL \u7cfb\u7d71\u3002", "author": "Geetansh Kalra et.al.", "authors": "Geetansh Kalra, Divye Singh, Justin Jose", "id": "2411.08392v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08392v1", "repo": "null"}}

Research\nindicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the\nearly design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD),\nwhich is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing\nbuilding energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad\nrange of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and\nresults in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied\nartificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research,\nthis study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating\nGreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning.\nUtilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call\nmethods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data\nanalysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge\nquery. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web\nplatform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped\nimprove design efficiency. This study not only effectively supports DGBD but\nalso provides inspiration for AI-assisted design.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u7da0\u8272\u5efa\u7bc9\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u74b0\u5883\u554f\u984c\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u9019\u9ede\u5df2\u7372\u5f97\u5ee3\u6cdb\u8a8d\u53ef\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8a2d\u8a08\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u9054\u6210\u8d85\u904e 40% \u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7bc0\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7da0\u8272\u5efa\u7bc9\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e2d\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff08DGBD\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u790e\u5728\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u6a21\u64ec\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u964d\u4f4e\u5efa\u7bc9\u7269\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7da0\u8272\u5efa\u7bc9\u9818\u57df\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u9019\u6d89\u53ca\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0e\u81f4\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u843d\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u5c07\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08AI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u6b64\u9818\u57df\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u65bc\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5275\u65b0\u5730\u5c07\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8207 DGBD \u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5275\u9020\u4e86 GreenQA\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8cc7\u6599\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u554f\u7b54\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6aa2\u7d22\u64f4\u5145\u751f\u6210\u3001\u601d\u8003\u93c8\u548c\u51fd\u6578\u547c\u53eb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cGreenQA \u80fd\u5920\u9032\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u554f\u7b54\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5929\u6c23\u8cc7\u6599\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8996\u89ba\u5316\u3001\u6aa2\u7d22\u7da0\u8272\u5efa\u7bc9\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u67e5\u8a62\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528 GreenQA \u7db2\u8def\u5e73\u53f0\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8abf\u67e5\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c96% \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8a8d\u70ba\u8a72\u5e73\u53f0\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u8a2d\u8a08\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u50c5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u652f\u63f4 DGBD\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba AI \u8f14\u52a9\u8a2d\u8a08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9748\u611f\u3002", "author": "Yihui Li et.al.", "authors": "Yihui Li, Xiaoyue Yan, Hao Zhou, Borong Lin", "id": "2412.04741v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04741v1", "repo": "null"}}

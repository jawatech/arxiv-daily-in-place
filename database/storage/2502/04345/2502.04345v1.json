Existing TCM Large Language Models (LLMs)\nexhibit critical limitations of uncomprehensive medical consultation and\ndiagnoses, and inaccurate syndrome differentiation-based treatment. To address\nthese issues, this study establishes JingFang (JF): a novel TCM Large Language\nModel that demonstrates the expert-level capability of medical diagnosis and\nsyndrome differentiation-based treatment. We innovate a Multi-agent Dynamic\nCollaborative Chain-of-Thought Mechanism (MDCCTM) for medical consultation,\nenabling JF with effective and accurate diagnostic ability. In addition, a\nSyndrome Agent and a Dual-Stage Retrieval Scheme (DSRS) are developed to\nsignificantly enhance the capacity of JF for disease treatment based on\nsyndrome differentiation. JingFang not only facilitates the application of LLMs\nbut also promotes the effective practice of TCM in human health protection and\ndisease treatment.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e2d\u91ab\u85e5\u5728\u4fdd\u5065\u8207\u75be\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5be6\u52d9\u61c9\u7528\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u539a\u7684\u91ab\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\u8207\u81e8\u5e8a\u7d93\u9a57\u3002\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u4e2d\u91ab\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8457\u91ab\u7642\u8aee\u8a62\u8207\u8a3a\u65b7\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\u3001\u75c7\u5019\u5206\u578b\u6cbb\u7642\u4e0d\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u9650\u5236\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cbe\u65b9\uff08JF\uff09\uff1a\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u4e2d\u91ab\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c08\u5bb6\u7d1a\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u8a3a\u65b7\u8207\u75c7\u5019\u5206\u578b\u6cbb\u7642\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5275\u65b0\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u52d5\u614b\u5354\u4f5c\u601d\u8003\u93c8\u6a5f\u5236\uff08MDCCTM\uff09\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u7642\u8aee\u8a62\uff0c\u8b93 JF \u5177\u5099\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9084\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u75c7\u5019\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u96d9\u968e\u6bb5\u6aa2\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\uff08DSRS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u986f\u8457\u589e\u5f37 JF \u57fa\u65bc\u75c7\u5019\u5206\u578b\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7cbe\u65b9\u4e0d\u50c5\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86 LLM \u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u63a8\u52d5\u4e86\u4e2d\u91ab\u85e5\u5728\u4eba\u985e\u4fdd\u5065\u8207\u75be\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5be6\u8e10\u3002", "author": "Yehan Yan et.al.", "authors": "Yehan Yan, Tianhao Ma, Ruotai Li, Xinhan Zheng, Guodong Shan, Chisheng Li", "id": "2502.04345v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04345v1", "repo": "null"}}

An often-advocated solution is to break up any\nsuch large conference into smaller conferences, but this can lead to isolation\nof communities and harm interdisciplinary research. We tackle this challenge by\nintroducing a notion of group fairness, called the core, which requires that\nevery possible community (subset of researchers) to be treated in a way that\nprevents them from unilaterally benefiting by withdrawing from a large\nconference.\n  We study a simple peer review model, prove that it always admits a reviewing\nassignment in the core, and design an efficient algorithm to find one such\nassignment. We use real data from CVPR and ICLR conferences to compare our\nalgorithm to existing reviewing assignment algorithms on a number of metrics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u6703\u8b70\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 NeurIPS \u548c AAAI\uff0c\u662f\u5404\u7a2e AI \u9818\u57df\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9ede\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u4f86\u81ea\u5927\u91cf\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u6295\u7a3f\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u5be9\u67e5\u9ad4\u9a57\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u6295\u7a3f\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u7d66\u793e\u7fa4\u5916\u8f03\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u7684\u5be9\u67e5\u8005\u3002\n\u7d93\u5e38\u63d0\u5021\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u5c07\u4efb\u4f55\u6b64\u985e\u5927\u578b\u6703\u8b70\u5206\u62c6\u70ba\u8f03\u5c0f\u7684\u6703\u8b70\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0e\u81f4\u793e\u7fa4\u5b64\u7acb\u4e26\u640d\u5bb3\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5f15\u5165\u7a31\u70ba\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5c0f\u7d44\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u4f86\u61c9\u5c0d\u6b64\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u8a72\u6982\u5ff5\u8981\u6c42\u6bcf\u500b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\uff08\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u5c0d\u5f85\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4ed6\u5011\u56e0\u9000\u51fa\u5927\u578b\u6703\u8b70\u800c\u55ae\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u76ca\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u540c\u5115\u5be9\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u5b83\u7e3d\u662f\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\u627f\u8a8d\u5be9\u67e5\u6307\u6d3e\uff0c\u4e26\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f86\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u6b64\u985e\u6307\u6d3e\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u4f86\u81ea CVPR \u548c ICLR \u6703\u8b70\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u591a\u9805\u6307\u6a19\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u5be9\u67e5\u6307\u6d3e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002", "author": "Haris Aziz et.al.", "authors": "Haris Aziz, Evi Micha, Nisarg Shah", "id": "2410.03474v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03474v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, medical datasets are usually small and scattered\nacross multiple providers, suffer from high class-imbalance, and are subject to\nstringent data privacy constraints. In this paper, the application of a data\nregularization algorithm, suitable for learning under high class-imbalance, in\na federated learning setting is proposed. Specifically, the goal of the\nproposed method is to enhance model performance for cardiovascular disease\nprediction by tackling the class-imbalance that typically characterizes\ndatasets used for this purpose, as well as by leveraging patient data available\nin different nodes of a federated ecosystem without compromising their privacy\nand enabling more resource sensitive allocation. The method is evaluated across\nfour datasets for cardiovascular disease prediction, which are scattered across\ndifferent clients, achieving improved performance. Meanwhile, its robustness\nunder various hyperparameter settings, as well as its ability to adapt to\ndifferent resource allocation scenarios, is verified.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u91ab\u7642\u6578\u64da\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5927\u5e45\u5f71\u97ff\u4e86\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u80fd\u8b93\u6a5f\u5668\uff0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u91ab\u7642\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6563\u5728\u591a\u500b\u4f9b\u61c9\u5546\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6703\u9762\u81e8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u985e\u5225\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u5230\u56b4\u683c\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96b1\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u6b63\u5247\u5316\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u5b83\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u985e\u5225\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4e26\u7528\u65bc\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u900f\u904e\u8655\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u65bc\u6b64\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e2d\u7279\u6709\u7684\u985e\u5225\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u806f\u90a6\u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7bc0\u9ede\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u4e0d\u640d\u5bb3\u5176\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5be6\u73fe\u66f4\u5177\u8cc7\u6e90\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f86\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u9810\u6e2c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u500b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u9810\u6e2c\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6236\u7aef\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e26\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u8d85\u53c3\u6578\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9069\u61c9\u4e0d\u540c\u8cc7\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u5834\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "author": "Georgios Tsoumplekas et.al.", "authors": "Georgios Tsoumplekas, Ilias Siniosoglou, Vasileios Argyriou, Ioannis D.

Recently, score-based diffusion\nmodels have extended their success beyond image generation, showing competitive\nperformance with discriminative methods in image {\\em classification}\ntasks~\\cite{zimmermann2021score}. However, their application to classification\nin the {\\em graph} domain, which presents unique challenges such as complex\ntopologies, remains underexplored. We show how graph diffusion models can be\napplied for graph classification. We find that to achieve competitive\nclassification accuracy, score-based graph diffusion models should be trained\nwith a novel training objective that is tailored to graph classification. In\nexperiments with a sampling-based inference method, our discriminative training\nobjective achieves state-of-the-art graph classification accuracy.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5206\u6578\u7684\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5c07\u5176\u6210\u529f\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u8207\u5224\u5225\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6297\u8861\u7684\u6548\u80fd~\\cite{zimmermann2021score}\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5716\u5f62\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5206\u985e\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u9019\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8907\u96dc\u62d3\u64b2\u7b49\u7368\u7279\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5716\u5f62\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5716\u5f62\u5206\u985e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u9054\u6210\u6709\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u7684\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5206\u6578\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u61c9\u4f7f\u7528\u91dd\u5c0d\u5716\u5f62\u5206\u985e\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u8a13\u7df4\u76ee\u6a19\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u62bd\u6a23\u7684\u63a8\u8ad6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5224\u5225\u5f0f\u8a13\u7df4\u76ee\u6a19\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Jia Jun Cheng Xian et.al.", "authors": "Jia Jun Cheng Xian, Sadegh Mahdavi, Renjie Liao, Oliver Schulte", "id": "2411.17236v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17236v1", "repo": "null"}}

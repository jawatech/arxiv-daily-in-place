The majority of the resulting hybrid approaches are usually trained\nwithin a unified learning framework, which often leads to convergence issues\ndue to the complexity of the learning task. In this work, we propose a new way\nto combine the two families of approaches. Specifically, we enrich a given\nknowledge graph by means of its pre-trained entity and relation embeddings\nbefore applying rule mining systems on the enriched knowledge graph. To\nvalidate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark\ndatasets. An analysis of the results generated by our approach suggests that we\ndiscover new valuable rules on the enriched graphs. We provide an open source\nimplementation of our approach as well as pretrained models and datasets at\nhttps://github.com/Jean-KOUAGOU/EnhancedRuleLearning", "paper_summary_zh": "\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4e0a\u7684\u898f\u5247\u6316\u6398\u5141\u8a31\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c\u3002\n\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5176\u6982\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u805e\u540d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9810\u6e2c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u3002\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u5df2\u7d93\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7d50\u5408\u9019\u5169\u500b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5e7e\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6846\u67b6\u5167\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u9019\u7531\u65bc\u5b78\u7fd2\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u6536\u6582\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7d50\u5408\u9019\u5169\u500b\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5176\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u548c\u95dc\u4fc2\u5d4c\u5165\u4f86\u8c50\u5bcc\u7d66\u5b9a\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5728\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4e0a\u61c9\u7528\u898f\u5247\u6316\u6398\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u9a57\u8b49\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4e03\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u5c0d\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7522\u751f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u8c50\u5bcc\u7684\u5716\u8b5c\u4e0a\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u898f\u5247\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u958b\u6e90\u5be6\u73fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u7db2\u5740\u70ba https://github.com/Jean-KOUAGOU/EnhancedRuleLearning", "author": "N'Dah Jean Kouagou et.al.", "authors": "N'Dah Jean Kouagou, Arif Yilmaz, Michel Dumontier, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo", "id": "2406.10144v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10144v1", "repo": "https://github.com/jean-kouagou/enhancedrulelearning"}}

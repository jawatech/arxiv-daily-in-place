An important application in deploying large language\nmodels is to augment LLMs with a private database for some specific task. The\nmain problem with this promising commercial use is that LLMs have been shown to\nmemorize their training data and their prompt data are vulnerable to membership\ninference attacks (MIA) and prompt leaking attacks. In order to deal with this\nproblem, we treat LLMs as untrusted in privacy and propose a locally\ndifferentially private framework of in-context learning(LDP-ICL) in the\nsettings where labels are sensitive. Considering the mechanisms of in-context\nlearning in Transformers by gradient descent, we provide an analysis of the\ntrade-off between privacy and utility in such LDP-ICL for classification.\nMoreover, we apply LDP-ICL to the discrete distribution estimation problem. In\nthe end, we perform several experiments to demonstrate our analysis results.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u9a5a\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5b78\u7fd2 (ICL) \u80fd\u529b\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u8981\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u662f\u70ba\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u589e\u5f37 LLM\uff0c\u4e26\u52a0\u5165\u79c1\u4eba\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u5546\u696d\u7528\u9014\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u554f\u984c\u662f\uff0c\u5df2\u8b49\u5be6 LLM \u6703\u8a18\u4f4f\u5176\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5176\u63d0\u793a\u8cc7\u6599\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6210\u54e1\u8eab\u5206\u63a8\u8ad6\u653b\u64ca (MIA) \u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6d29\u6f0f\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8655\u7406\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07 LLM \u8996\u70ba\u5728\u96b1\u79c1\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u60c5\u5883\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u5728\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u96b1\u79c1\u67b6\u69cb (LDP-ICL)\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6a19\u7c64\u654f\u611f\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u8003\u91cf Transformer \u4e2d\u60c5\u5883\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b64\u985e LDP-ICL \u5728\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5be6\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u53d6\u6368\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07 LDP-ICL \u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u96e2\u6563\u5206\u4f48\u4f30\u8a08\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u591a\u9805\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a57\u8b49\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "author": "Chunyan Zheng et.al.", "authors": "Chunyan Zheng, Keke Sun, Wenhao Zhao, Haibo Zhou, Lixin Jiang, Shaoyang Song, Chunlai Zhou", "id": "2405.04032v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04032v2", "repo": "null"}}

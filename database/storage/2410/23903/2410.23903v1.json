To this end, we present PyRAT, a tool\nbased on abstract interpretation to verify the safety and the robustness of\nneural networks. In this paper, we describe the different abstractions used by\nPyRAT to find the reachable states of a neural network starting from its input\nas well as the main features of the tool to provide fast and accurate analysis\nof neural networks. PyRAT has already been used in several collaborations to\nensure safety guarantees, with its second place at the VNN-Comp 2024 showcasing\nits performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4e26\u7528\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u95dc\u9375\u9818\u57df\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u904b\u8f38\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c...\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8b49\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5426\u8a8d\u7684\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 PyRAT\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u62bd\u8c61\u8a6e\u91cb\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u9a57\u8b49\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86 PyRAT \u7528\u65bc\u5f9e\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u8f38\u5165\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u53ef\u9054\u72c0\u614b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8a72\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5206\u6790\u3002PyRAT \u5df2\u5728\u591a\u9805\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7528\u65bc\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8b49\uff0c\u5176\u5728 VNN-Comp 2024 \u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Augustin Lemesle et.al.", "authors": "Augustin Lemesle, Julien Lehmann, Tristan Le Gall", "id": "2410.23903v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23903v1", "repo": "null"}}

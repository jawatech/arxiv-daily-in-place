Accurate segmentation of skin lesions from\nmedical images is essential for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment\nplanning. In this paper, we propose a new model for skin lesion segmentation\nnamely AC-MambaSeg, an enhanced model that has the hybrid CNN-Mamba backbone,\nand integrates advanced components such as Convolutional Block Attention Module\n(CBAM), Attention Gate, and Selective Kernel Bottleneck. AC-MambaSeg leverages\nthe Vision Mamba framework for efficient feature extraction, while CBAM and\nSelective Kernel Bottleneck enhance its ability to focus on informative regions\nand suppress background noise. We evaluate the performance of AC-MambaSeg on\ndiverse datasets of skin lesion images including ISIC-2018 and PH2; then\ncompare it against existing segmentation methods. Our model shows promising\npotential for improving computer-aided diagnosis systems and facilitating early\ndetection and treatment of dermatological diseases.

In this study, we apply the\nAutomated Concept-based Explanation (ACE) method to plant disease\nclassification using the widely adopted InceptionV3 model and the PlantVillage\ndataset. ACE automatically identifies the visual concepts found in the image\ndata and provides insights about the critical features influencing the model\npredictions. This approach reveals both effective disease-related patterns and\nincidental biases, such as those from background or lighting that can\ncompromise model robustness. Through systematic experiments, ACE helped us to\nidentify relevant features and pinpoint areas for targeted model improvement.\nOur findings demonstrate the potential of ACE to improve the explainability of\nplant disease classification based on deep learning, which is essential for\nproducing transparent tools for plant disease management in agriculture.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5df2\u900f\u904e\u57fa\u65bc\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u5075\u6e2c\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u5c0d\u65bc\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u5075\u6e2c\u4ecd\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u89e3\u91cb (ACE) \u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a1\u7528\u7684 InceptionV3 \u6a21\u578b\u8207 PlantVillage \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002ACE \u6703\u81ea\u52d5\u8fa8\u8b58\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u767c\u73fe\u7684\u8996\u89ba\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u95dc\u65bc\u5f71\u97ff\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u9732\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u95dc\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5076\u7136\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4f86\u81ea\u80cc\u666f\u6216\u5149\u7dda\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u640d\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u900f\u904e\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0cACE \u5354\u52a9\u6211\u5011\u8fa8\u8b58\u76f8\u95dc\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e26\u7cbe\u78ba\u6307\u51fa\u76ee\u6a19\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u5584\u9818\u57df\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86 ACE \u6539\u5584\u57fa\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u985e\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u65bc\u5728\u8fb2\u696d\u4e2d\u7522\u751f\u7528\u65bc\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5de5\u5177\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "author": "Jihen Amara et.al.", "authors": "Jihen Amara, Birgitta K\u00f6nig-Ries, Sheeba Samuel", "id": "2412.07408v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07408v1", "repo": "null"}}

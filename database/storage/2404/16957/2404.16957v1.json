The interconnectivity of these systems,\nethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI\ntechnology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional\nresponsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a\nComputational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and\nethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders.\nThe computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the\nlimitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted\nscenarios, showcasing the framework's explainability, coherence, and adaptivity\nproperties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal\nrole of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium\ncomputation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case\nstudy, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse\nresponsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into\naccountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a\nsustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and\nreflection.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yunfei Ge et.al.", "authors": "Yunfei Ge,Quanyan Zhu", "id": "2404.16957v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16957v1", "repo": "null"}}

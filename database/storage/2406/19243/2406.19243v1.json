In the contemporary era, the quality and quantity of neural networks\nare increasing exponentially. Concurrently, there is a growing number of\nsystems that aim to manipulate data through the use of voice conversion and\ntext-to-speech models. The field of voice biometrics forgery is aided by a\nnumber of challenges, including SSTC, ASVSpoof, and SingFake.\n  This paper presents a system for automatic speaker verification. The primary\nobjective of our model is the extraction of embeddings from the target\nspeaker's audio in order to obtain information about important characteristics\nof his voice, such as pitch, energy, and the duration of phonemes. This\ninformation is used in our multivoice TTS pipeline, which is currently under\ndevelopment. However, this model was employed within the SSTC challenge to\nverify users whose voice had undergone voice conversion, where it demonstrated\nan EER of 20.669.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5fb5\u5b89\u5168\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u9a57\u8b49\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u790e\u662f\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u8072\u97f3\u3002\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u55ae\u7368\u4f7f\u7528 ASV\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8207\u5176\u4ed6 AI \u6a21\u578b\u7d50\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5728\u7576\u4ee3\uff0c\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u548c\u6578\u91cf\u6b63\u5448\u6307\u6578\u7d1a\u589e\u9577\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u591a\u7cfb\u7d71\u65e8\u5728\u900f\u904e\u4f7f\u7528\u8a9e\u97f3\u8f49\u63db\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u8f49\u8a9e\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u64cd\u7e31\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u8a9e\u97f3\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5fb5\u507d\u9020\u9818\u57df\u53d7\u5230\u8a31\u591a\u6311\u6230\u7684\u5e6b\u52a9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec SSTC\u3001ASVSpoof \u548c SingFake\u3002\n\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u9a57\u8b49\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u5f9e\u76ee\u6a19\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u97f3\u8a0a\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d6\u5f97\u5176\u8072\u97f3\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u97f3\u9ad8\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u97f3\u7d20\u7684\u6301\u7e8c\u6642\u9593\u3002\u6b64\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7528\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u958b\u767c\u7684\u591a\u8a9e\u97f3 TTS \u7ba1\u7dda\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u5728 SSTC \u6311\u6230\u4e2d\u7528\u65bc\u9a57\u8b49\u8072\u97f3\u7d93\u904e\u8a9e\u97f3\u8f49\u63db\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff0c\u5176 EER \u70ba 20.669\u3002", "author": "Borodin Kirill Nikolayevich et.al.", "authors": "Borodin Kirill Nikolayevich, Kudryavtsev Vasiliy Dmitrievich, Mkrtchian Grach Maratovich, Gorodnichev Mikhail Genadievich, Korzh Dmitrii Sergeevich", "id": "2406.19243v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19243v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, they still rely on an RNN-based context network to model\ntemporal dependencies, largely due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this\nwork, we propose a pure Transformer-based SED model with masked-reconstruction\nbased pre-training, termed MAT-SED. Specifically, a Transformer with relative\npositional encoding is first designed as the context network, pre-trained by\nthe masked-reconstruction task on all available target data in a\nself-supervised way. Both the encoder and the context network are jointly\nfine-tuned in a semi-supervised manner. Furthermore, a global-local feature\nfusion strategy is proposed to enhance the localization capability. Evaluation\nof MAT-SED on DCASE2023 task4 surpasses state-of-the-art performance, achieving\n0.587/0.896 PSDS1/PSDS2 respectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8072\u97f3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5075\u6e2c (SED) \u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u9810\u8a13\u7df4 Transformer \u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u7684 DCASE \u6311\u6230\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u6a19\u7c64\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc RNN \u7684\u8108\u7d61\u7db2\u8def\u4f86\u5efa\u6a21\u6642\u9593\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u7d14 Transformer \u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684 SED \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5099\u906e\u7f69\u91cd\u5efa\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba MAT-SED\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5c07\u4e00\u500b\u5e36\u6709\u76f8\u5c0d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7de8\u78bc\u7684 Transformer \u8a2d\u8a08\u70ba\u8108\u7d61\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u81ea\u6211\u76e3\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u8cc7\u6599\u4e0a\u4ee5\u906e\u7f69\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52d9\u9032\u884c\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u548c\u8108\u7d61\u7db2\u8def\u90fd\u6703\u4ee5\u534a\u76e3\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u806f\u5408\u5fae\u8abf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u57df-\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5fb5\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002MAT-SED \u5728 DCASE2023 \u4efb\u52d9 4 \u4e0a\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u5225\u9054\u5230 0.587/0.896 PSDS1/PSDS2\u3002", "author": "Pengfei Cai et.al.", "authors": "Pengfei Cai, Yan Song, Kang Li, Haoyu Song, Ian McLoughlin", "id": "2408.08673v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08673v1", "repo": "null"}}

Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge\ndataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield\nuncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon\ncompletion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the\noriginal loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic\nuncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various\nassociation indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout\nand Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty\nthreshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential\nLearning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a\nmore uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to\nepistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant\nshift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity,\ncompatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our\nresults suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can\nendow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical\nrobustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can\nuse such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence\nintervals.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Hai Siong Tan et.al.", "authors": "Hai Siong Tan,Kuancheng Wang,Rafe Mcbeth", "id": "2404.17126v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17126v1", "repo": "null"}}

Our work\nis conducted in the context of high-dosage human tutoring where 9th-grade\nstudents (N= 1080) attended small group tutorials and individually practiced\nproblems on an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). We analyzed whether tutors'\ntalk moves and students' performance on the ITS predicted scores on math\nlearning assessments. We trained Random Forest Classifiers (RFCs) to\ndistinguish high and low assessment scores based on tutor talk moves, student's\nITS performance metrics, and their combination. A decision tree was extracted\nfrom each RFC to yield an interpretable model. We found AUCs of 0.63 for talk\nmoves, 0.66 for ITS, and 0.77 for their combination, suggesting interactivity\namong the two feature sources. Specifically, the best decision tree emerged\nfrom combining the tutor talk moves that encouraged rigorous thinking and\nstudents' ITS mastery. In essence, tutor talk that encouraged mathematical\nreasoning predicted achievement for students who demonstrated high mastery on\nthe ITS, whereas tutors' revoicing of students' mathematical ideas and\ncontributions was predictive for students with low ITS mastery. Implications\nfor practice are discussed.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u5bb6\u6559\u8a71\u8a9e\u5982\u4f55\u8207\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u77e5\u8b58\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5291\u91cf\u4eba\u985e\u5bb6\u6559\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u9032\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d 9 \u5e74\u7d1a\u5b78\u751f (N= 1080) \u53c3\u52a0\u4e86\u5c0f\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u6559\u7cfb\u7d71 (ITS) \u4e0a\u500b\u5225\u7df4\u7fd2\u984c\u76ee\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bb6\u6559\u7684\u8ac7\u8a71\u8209\u52d5\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u5728 ITS \u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u662f\u5426\u9810\u6e2c\u4e86\u6578\u5b78\u5b78\u7fd2\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a13\u7df4\u96a8\u6a5f\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u985e\u5668 (RFC) \u6839\u64da\u5bb6\u6559\u8ac7\u8a71\u8209\u52d5\u3001\u5b78\u751f\u7684 ITS \u8868\u73fe\u6307\u6a19\u53ca\u5176\u7d44\u5408\u4f86\u5340\u5206\u9ad8\u5206\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u3002\u5f9e\u6bcf\u500b RFC \u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6c7a\u7b56\u6a39\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u8ac7\u8a71\u8209\u52d5\u7684 AUC \u70ba 0.63\uff0cITS \u70ba 0.66\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u70ba 0.77\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u5169\u500b\u7279\u5fb5\u4f86\u6e90\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u6a39\u4f86\u81ea\u7d50\u5408\u9f13\u52f5\u56b4\u8b39\u601d\u7dad\u7684\u5bb6\u6559\u8ac7\u8a71\u8209\u52d5\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u7684 ITS \u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u3002\u5be6\u8cea\u4e0a\uff0c\u9f13\u52f5\u6578\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bb6\u6559\u8ac7\u8a71\u9810\u6e2c\u4e86\u5728 ITS \u4e0a\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u9ad8\u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u800c\u5bb6\u6559\u5c0d\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u8ca2\u737b\u7684\u91cd\u8ff0\u5247\u9810\u6e2c\u4e86 ITS \u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u3002\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u5c0d\u5be6\u8e10\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Mark Abdelshiheed et.al.", "authors": "Mark Abdelshiheed, Jennifer K.

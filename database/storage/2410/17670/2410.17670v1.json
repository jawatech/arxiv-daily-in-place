While their effectiveness for individual users has\nbeen evaluated in the literature, little is known about their proclivity to\nchange language or reduce its richness when adopted by a large user base. In\nthis paper, we take a first step towards quantifying this risk by measuring the\nsemantic and vocabulary change enacted by the use of rephrasing tools on a\nmulti-domain corpus of human-generated text.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5beb\u4f5c\u52a9\u7406\u548c\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5b57\u5167\u5bb9\u7684\u5275\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u5df2\u8a55\u4f30\u5176\u5c0d\u500b\u5225\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7576\u5927\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63a1\u7528\u6642\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u6539\u8b8a\u8a9e\u8a00\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u8c50\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u50be\u5411\u537b\u9bae\u70ba\u4eba\u77e5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u8861\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7531\u4eba\u985e\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u591a\u9818\u57df\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e0a\u6240\u57f7\u884c\u7684\u8a9e\u610f\u548c\u8a5e\u5f59\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u671d\u91cf\u5316\u6b64\u98a8\u96aa\u9081\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "author": "Mengying Wang et.al.", "authors": "Mengying Wang, Andreas Spitz", "id": "2410.17670v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17670v1", "repo": "null"}}

More\nspecifically, the issue of theory ladenness has remerged as questions about\nwhether and how ML models (MLMs) and ML modelling strategies are impacted by\nthe domain theory of the scientific field in which ML is used and implemented\n(e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, etc). On the one hand, some have argued\nthat there is no difference between traditional (pre ML) and ML assisted\nscience. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in the\nanalysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others have\nargued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory independent and, in\nsome cases, even theory free. In this article, we argue that both positions are\noverly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay between\nML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theory\nladenness in ML assisted science. Our analysis reveals that, while the\nconstruction of MLMs can be relatively independent of domain theory, the\npractical implementation and interpretation of these models within a given\nspecific domain still relies on fundamental theoretical assumptions and\nbackground knowledge.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u5730\u8bf4\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u7ecf\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5173\u4e8e ML \u6a21\u578b (MLM) \u548c ML \u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u5230 ML \u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\uff08ML \u4e4b\u524d\uff09\u548c ML \u8f85\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u533a\u522b\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u90fd\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u5219\u8ba4\u4e3a ML \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7acb\u573a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 ML \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 ML \u8f85\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136 ML \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u7136\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "author": "Alberto Termine et.al.", "authors": "Alberto Termine, Emanuele Ratti, Alessandro Facchini", "id": "2409.11277v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11277v1", "repo": "null"}}

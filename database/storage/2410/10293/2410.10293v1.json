It\nmainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a.\nretrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate generation\nmodules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends\non the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the retrieval\nparadigm that we design and use remains flat, which treats the retrieval\nprocedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness,\nwe argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a\nsignificant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the\nceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive\nretrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG,\nso as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG\nestablishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine\ngranularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can\nrelieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval\nperformance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable\nretrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u64f7\u53d6\u589e\u5f37\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76db\u884c\u3002\u5b83\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u64f7\u53d6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u3002\u64f7\u53d6\u6a21\u7d44\uff08\u53c8\u7a31\u64f7\u53d6\u5668\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u5c0b\u627e\u7528\u65bc\u4fc3\u9032\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7d44\uff08\u53c8\u7a31\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u7684\u6709\u7528\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u64f7\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u64f7\u53d6\u7bc4\u4f8b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5e73\u9762\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u64f7\u53d6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8655\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6046\u5b9a\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u5169\u500b\u9650\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5e73\u9762\u64f7\u53d6\u5c0d\u55ae\u4e00\u64f7\u53d6\u5668\u9020\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u8ca0\u64d4\uff1b(2) \u6046\u5b9a\u7c92\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u64f7\u53d6\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u70ba RAG \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5177\u6709\u7c97\u5230\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6f38\u9032\u5f0f\u64f7\u53d6\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba FunnelRAG\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0cFunnelRAG \u901a\u904e\u5354\u8abf\u7c97\u5230\u7d30\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5927\u5230\u5c0f\u7684\u6578\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u6f38\u9032\u5f0f\u64f7\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e1b\u8f15\u55ae\u4e00\u64f7\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u8ca0\u64d4\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u5347\u64f7\u53d6\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8868\u660e\uff0cFunnelRAG \u9054\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u7576\u7684\u64f7\u53d6\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5c07\u6642\u9593\u958b\u92b7\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e86\u5c07\u8fd1 40%\u3002", "author": "Xinping Zhao et.al.", "authors": "Xinping Zhao, Yan Zhong, Zetian Sun, Xinshuo Hu, Zhenyu Liu, Dongfang Li, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang", "id": "2410.10293v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v1", "repo": "null"}}

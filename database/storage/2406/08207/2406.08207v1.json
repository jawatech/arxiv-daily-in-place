{"2406.08207": {"publish_time": "2024-06-12", "title": "Transformer-based Model for ASR N-Best Rescoring and Rewriting", "paper_summary": "Voice assistants increasingly use on-device Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR) to ensure speed and privacy. However, due to resource constraints on the\ndevice, queries pertaining to complex information domains often require further\nprocessing by a search engine. For such applications, we propose a novel\nTransformer based model capable of rescoring and rewriting, by exploring full\ncontext of the N-best hypotheses in parallel. We also propose a new\ndiscriminative sequence training objective that can work well for both rescore\nand rewrite tasks. We show that our Rescore+Rewrite model outperforms the\nRescore-only baseline, and achieves up to an average 8.6% relative Word Error\nRate (WER) reduction over the ASR system by itself.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u97f3\u52a9\u7406\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58 (ASR) \u4f86\u78ba\u4fdd\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u96b1\u79c1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8207\u8907\u96dc\u8cc7\u8a0a\u9818\u57df\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u641c\u5c0b\u5f15\u64ce\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8655\u7406\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u6b64\u985e\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684 Transformer \u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u900f\u904e\u4e26\u884c\u63a2\u7d22 N \u500b\u6700\u4f73\u5047\u8a2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4f86\u91cd\u65b0\u8a55\u5206\u548c\u6539\u5beb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u5224\u5225\u5e8f\u5217\u8a13\u7df4\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u91cd\u65b0\u8a55\u5206\u548c\u6539\u5beb\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u6211\u5011\u7684 Rescore+Rewrite \u6a21\u578b\u512a\u65bc\u50c5 Rescore \u7684\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5c07 ASR \u7cfb\u7d71\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5b57\u5143\u932f\u8aa4\u7387 (WER) \u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u9054 8.6%\u3002", "author": "Iwen E.

This paper explores\nthe innovative approaches and methodologies within the realm of Explainable AI\n(XAI) that are revolutionizing the interpretability of medical diagnostic\nmodels. By shedding light on the underlying decision-making process, XAI\ntechniques empower healthcare professionals to understand, trust, and\neffectively utilize these models for accurate and reliable medical diagnoses.\nThis review highlights the key advancements in XAI for medical diagnostics and\ntheir potential to transform the healthcare landscape, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and fostering trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Sujith K Mandala et.al.", "authors": "Sujith K Mandala", "id": "2306.01668v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01668v1", "repo": "null"}}

We present an\napproach that leverages methods developed in natural language processing and\nreal-world data to prioritize potential, new indications for a mechanism of\naction (MoA). We specifically use representation learning to generate\nembeddings of indications and prioritize them based on their proximity to the\nindications with the strongest available evidence for the MoA. We demonstrate\nthe successful deployment of our approach for anti-IL-17A using embeddings\ngenerated with SPPMI and present an evaluation framework to determine the\nquality of indication finding results and the derived embeddings.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u7642\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6cbb\u7642\u591a\u7a2e\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u958b\u767c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f86\u512a\u5148\u8003\u616e\u4f5c\u7528\u6a5f\u5236 (MoA) \u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u65b0\u9069\u61c9\u75c7\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7279\u5225\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u5fb5\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u9069\u61c9\u75c7\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u6839\u64da\u5b83\u5011\u8207\u8b49\u64da\u6700\u5145\u5206\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u75c7\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f86\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u9032\u884c\u512a\u5148\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528 SPPMI \u751f\u6210\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u6211\u5011\u91dd\u5c0d\u6297 IL-17A \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u8a55\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4f86\u78ba\u5b9a\u9069\u61c9\u75c7\u767c\u73fe\u7d50\u679c\u548c\u884d\u751f\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u54c1\u8cea\u3002", "author": "Maren Eckhoff et.al.", "authors": "Maren Eckhoff, Valmir Selimi, Alexander Aranovitch, Ian Lyons, Emily Briggs, Jennifer Hou, Alex Devereson, Matej Macak, David Champagne, Chris Anagnostopoulos", "id": "2410.19174v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19174v1", "repo": "null"}}

This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model\nfor detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images, designed to assist overburdened\nmedical professionals. Our proposed model leverages the strengths of VGG16,\nDenseNet121, and MobileNetV2 to extract features, followed by Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, after which the features\nare stacked and classified using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). We\nconducted comparative analysis between the proposed hybrid model and individual\npre-trained CNN models, using a dataset of 2,108 training images and 373 test\nimages comprising both COVID-positive and non-COVID images. Our proposed hybrid\nmodel achieved an accuracy of 98.93%, outperforming the individual models in\nterms of precision, recall, F1 scores, and ROC curve performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u65e9\u671f\u5075\u6e2c COVID-19 \u5c0d\u6709\u6548\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u50b3\u64ad\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5f9e\u96fb\u8166\u65b7\u5c64\u6383\u63cf\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5075\u6e2c COVID-19\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5354\u52a9\u8ca0\u64d4\u904e\u91cd\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528 VGG16\u3001DenseNet121 \u548c MobileNetV2 \u7684\u512a\u9ede\u4f86\u8403\u53d6\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u9032\u884c\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790 (PCA) \u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u964d\u7dad\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5c07\u7279\u5fb5\u5806\u758a\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u985e\u5668 (SVC) \u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u500b\u5225\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 CNN \u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b 2,108 \u5f35\u8a13\u7df4\u5f71\u50cf\u548c 373 \u5f35\u6e2c\u8a66\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b COVID-19 \u967d\u6027\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u975e COVID-19 \u5f71\u50cf\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9054\u5230\u4e86 98.93% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u6e96\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1 \u5206\u6578\u548c ROC \u66f2\u7dda\u6548\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u500b\u5225\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Suresh Babu Nettur et.al.", "authors": "Suresh Babu Nettur, Shanthi Karpurapu, Unnati Nettur, Likhit Sagar Gajja, Sravanthy Myneni, Akhil Dusi, Lalithya Posham", "id": "2501.17160v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17160v1", "repo": "null"}}

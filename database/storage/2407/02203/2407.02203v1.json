However, building\nhigh-performance and robust adaptation rules is often a challenge because it\nessentially involves searching the optimal design in a complex (variables)\nspace. In response, this paper attempt to employ large language models (LLMs)\nas a optimizer to construct and optimize adaptation rules, leveraging the\ncommon sense and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. Preliminary\nexperiments conducted in SWIM have validated the effectiveness and limitation\nof our method.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u662f\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u7684\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u790e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u9ede\u662f\u4eba\u985e\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u61c9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u898f\u5247\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u672c\u8cea\u4e0a\u6d89\u53ca\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u8907\u96dc\u7684\uff08\u8b8a\u6578\uff09\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u641c\u5c0b\u6700\u4f73\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u56de\u61c9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5617\u8a66\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4f5c\u70ba\u512a\u5316\u5668\u4f86\u5efa\u69cb\u548c\u512a\u5316\u9069\u61c9\u898f\u5247\uff0c\u5229\u7528 LLM \u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5e38\u8b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728 SWIM \u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5be6\u9a57\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Yusei Ishimizu et.al.", "authors": "Yusei Ishimizu, Jialong Li, Jinglue Xu, Jinyu Cai, Hitoshi Iba, Kenji Tei", "id": "2407.02203v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02203v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, these shared tasks\ntend to focus either on cases where text is limited to one particular domain or\ncases where text can be from many domains, some of which may not be seen during\ntest time. In this shared task, using the newly released RAID benchmark, we aim\nto answer whether or not models can detect generated text from a large, yet\nfixed, number of domains and LLMs, all of which are seen during training. Over\nthe course of three months, our task was attempted by 9 teams with 23 detector\nsubmissions. We find that multiple participants were able to obtain accuracies\nof over 99% on machine-generated text from RAID while maintaining a 5% False\nPositive Rate -- suggesting that detectors are able to robustly detect text\nfrom many domains and models simultaneously. We discuss potential\ninterpretations of this result and provide directions for future research.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u5171\u7528\u4efb\u52d9\u91dd\u5c0d\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5075\u6e2c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5171\u7528\u4efb\u52d9\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u6587\u5b57\u50c5\u9650\u65bc\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6216\u6587\u5b57\u53ef\u80fd\u4f86\u81ea\u8a31\u591a\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u9818\u57df\u5728\u6e2c\u8a66\u671f\u9593\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u5171\u7528\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u767c\u5e03\u7684 RAID \u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u56de\u7b54\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u5927\u91cf\u4f46\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u9818\u57df\u548c LLM \u4e2d\u5075\u6e2c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9019\u4e9b\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u500b\u6708\u5167\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u7531 9 \u500b\u5718\u968a\u5617\u8a66\uff0c\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e86 23 \u500b\u5075\u6e2c\u5668\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u591a\u4f4d\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u80fd\u5920\u5728 RAID \u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u8d85\u904e 99% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u6301 5% \u7684\u8aa4\u5831\u7387\u2014\u2014\u9019\u8868\u660e\u5075\u6e2c\u5668\u80fd\u5920\u7a69\u5065\u5730\u540c\u6642\u5075\u6e2c\u4f86\u81ea\u8a31\u591a\u9818\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Liam Dugan et.al.", "authors": "Liam Dugan, Andrew Zhu, Firoj Alam, Preslav Nakov, Marianna Apidianaki, Chris Callison-Burch", "id": "2501.08913v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08913v1", "repo": "null"}}

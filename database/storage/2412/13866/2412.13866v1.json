Recent work devised examples of machine learning (ML) classifiers for\nwhich the computed SHAP scores are thoroughly unsatisfactory, by allowing human\ndecision-makers to be misled. Nevertheless, such examples could be perceived as\nsomewhat artificial, since the selected classes must be interpreted as numeric.\nFurthermore, it was unclear how general were the issues identified with SHAP\nscores. This paper answers these criticisms. First, the paper shows that for\nBoolean classifiers there are arbitrarily many examples for which the SHAP\nscores must be deemed unsatisfactory. Second, the paper shows that the issues\nwith SHAP scores are also observed in the case of regression models. In\naddition, the paper studies the class of regression models that respect\nLipschitz continuity, a measure of a function's rate of change that finds\nimportant recent uses in ML, including model robustness. Concretely, the paper\nshows that the issues with SHAP scores occur even for regression models that\nrespect Lipschitz continuity. Finally, the paper shows that the same issues are\nguaranteed to exist for arbitrarily differentiable regression models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb AI (XAI) \u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528 Shapley \u503c\u662f\u7531\u5de5\u5177 SHAP \u5f15\u767c\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u901a\u5e38\u7a31\u70ba SHAP \u5206\u6578\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2 (ML) \u5206\u985e\u5668\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u7684 SHAP \u5206\u6578\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u8b93\u4eba\u985e\u6c7a\u7b56\u8005\u8aa4\u5165\u6b67\u9014\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u7bc4\u4f8b\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u6709\u9ede\u4eba\u70ba\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6240\u9078\u7684\u985e\u5225\u5fc5\u9808\u89e3\u91cb\u70ba\u6578\u5b57\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u4f7f\u7528 SHAP \u5206\u6578\u6240\u767c\u73fe\u7684\u554f\u984c\u6709\u591a\u666e\u904d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u6279\u8a55\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\u5c0d\u65bc\u5e03\u6797\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u500b\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d SHAP \u5206\u6578\u5fc5\u9808\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u6b78\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u4e5f\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86 SHAP \u5206\u6578\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0a\u91cd Lipschitz \u9023\u7e8c\u6027\u7684\u56de\u6b78\u6a21\u578b\u985e\u5225\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u51fd\u6578\u8b8a\u5316\u7387\u7684\u91cf\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728 ML \u4e2d\u767c\u73fe\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0d\u65bc\u5c0a\u91cd Lipschitz \u9023\u7e8c\u6027\u7684\u56de\u6b78\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6703\u51fa\u73fe SHAP \u5206\u6578\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u56de\u6b78\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u8b49\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Olivier Letoffe et.al.", "authors": "Olivier Letoffe, Xuanxiang Huang, Joao Marques-Silva", "id": "2412.13866v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13866v1", "repo": "null"}}

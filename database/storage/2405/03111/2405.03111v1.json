The proposed architecture\nreplicates the temporal dynamics of keystroke production across sensorimotor,\ncognitive, and phenomenal layers. Utilizing data from the CRITT TPR-DB, the\nTask Segment Framework, and the HOF taxonomy, we demonstrate the temporal\nbreakdown of the typing flow on distinct timelines within these three layers.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Michael Carl et.al.", "authors": "Michael Carl", "id": "2405.03111v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03111v1", "repo": "null"}}

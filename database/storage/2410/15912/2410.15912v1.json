Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for\ncomprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In\nresponse, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion\nplanning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other\nvehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics\nthat significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have\nrestructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging large language models to\nassess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main road. Extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated the advanced nature of this evaluation benchmark.\nThrough this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and\nidentified common issues. The environment and vehicle motion planning models we\nhave designed can be accessed at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bench4Merge-EB5D", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9032\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u878d\u5165\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u6b64\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u8a31\u591a\u904b\u52d5\u898f\u5283\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u96e3\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\n\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u5c01\u9589\u8ff4\u8def\u6a21\u64ec\u5668\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u8eca\u8f1b\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u548c\u96a8\u6a5f\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7121\u6cd5\u6e96\u78ba\u8a55\u4f30\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e92\u52d5\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u904b\u52d5\u898f\u5283\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u6307\u6a19\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8a55\u4f30\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u5408\u4f75\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\n\u4f5c\u70ba\u56de\u61c9\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5c01\u9589\u8ff4\u8def\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u5408\u4f75\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u904b\u52d5\u898f\u5283\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5fae\u884c\u70ba\u7279\u5fb5\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e2d\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u8eca\u8f1b\uff0c\u9019\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u3002\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8abf\u6574\u4e86\u8a55\u4f30\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u6bcf\u500b\u81ea\u4e3b\u8eca\u8f1b\u4f75\u5165\u4e3b\u5e79\u9053\u3002\n\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u6e96\u7684\u5148\u9032\u6027\u3002\n\u901a\u904e\u9019\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u5c0d\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u4e26\u627e\u51fa\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\n\u6211\u5011\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u548c\u8eca\u8f1b\u904b\u52d5\u898f\u5283\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bench4Merge-EB5D \u7372\u5f97", "author": "Zhengming Wang et.al.", "authors": "Zhengming Wang, Junli Wang, Pengfei Li, Zhaohan Li, Peng Li, Yilun Chen", "id": "2410.15912v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15912v1", "repo": "null"}}

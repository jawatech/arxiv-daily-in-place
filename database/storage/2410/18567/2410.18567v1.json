A Study of Japanese Lexical Complexity", "paper_summary": "The tasks of lexical complexity prediction (LCP) and complex word\nidentification (CWI) commonly presuppose that difficult to understand words are\nshared by the target population. Meanwhile, personalization methods have also\nbeen proposed to adapt models to individual needs. We verify that a recent\nJapanese LCP dataset is representative of its target population by partially\nreplicating the annotation. By another reannotation we show that native Chinese\nspeakers perceive the complexity differently due to Sino-Japanese vocabulary.\nTo explore the possibilities of personalization, we compare competitive\nbaselines trained on the group mean ratings and individual ratings in terms of\nperformance for an individual. We show that the model trained on a group mean\nperforms similarly to an individual model in the CWI task, while achieving good\nLCP performance for an individual is difficult. We also experiment with\nadapting a finetuned BERT model, which results only in marginal improvements\nacross all settings.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a5e\u5f59\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u9810\u6e2c (LCP) \u548c\u8907\u96dc\u8a5e\u5f59\u8b58\u5225 (CWI) \u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u901a\u5e38\u9810\u8a2d\u76ee\u6a19\u65cf\u7fa4\u5206\u4eab\u96e3\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8a5e\u5f59\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4e5f\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u8abf\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408\u500b\u4eba\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9a57\u8b49\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65e5\u6587 LCP \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4ee3\u8868\u5176\u76ee\u6a19\u65cf\u7fa4\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u8907\u88fd\u8a3b\u89e3\u3002\u900f\u904e\u53e6\u4e00\u7a2e\u91cd\u65b0\u8a3b\u89e3\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u7531\u65bc\u6f22\u5b57\u65e5\u8a9e\u8a5e\u5f59\uff0c\u6f22\u8a9e\u6bcd\u8a9e\u4eba\u58eb\u5c0d\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6bd4\u8f03\u5728\u7fa4\u7d44\u5e73\u5747\u8a55\u5206\u548c\u500b\u4eba\u8a55\u5206\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u57fa\u7dda\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u500b\u4eba\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u7fa4\u7d44\u5e73\u5747\u6578\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 CWI \u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u8207\u500b\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u985e\u4f3c\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u96e3\u4ee5\u9054\u6210\u826f\u597d\u7684\u500b\u4eba LCP \u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u5617\u8a66\u8abf\u6574\u5fae\u8abf BERT \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u50c5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u6975\u5c0f\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002", "author": "Adam Nohejl et.al.", "authors": "Adam Nohejl, Akio Hayakawa, Yusuke Ide, Taro Watanabe", "id": "2410.18567v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18567v1", "repo": "null"}}

Therefore, a sleep study that includes\nsleep patterns and disorders is crucial to enhancing our knowledge about\nindividuals' health status. The findings on sleep stages and sleep disorders\nrelied on polysomnography and self-report measures, and then the study went\nthrough clinical assessments by expert physicians. However, the evaluation\nprocess of sleep stage classification and sleep disorder has become more\nconvenient with artificial intelligence applications and numerous\ninvestigations focusing on various datasets with advanced algorithms and\ntechniques that offer improved computational ease and accuracy. This study aims\nto provide a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of the recent\nliterature to analyze the different approaches and their outcomes in sleep\nstudies, which includes works on sleep stages classification and sleep disorder\ndetection using AI. In this review, 183 articles were initially selected from\ndifferent journals, among which 80 records were enlisted for explicit review,\nranging from 2016 to 2023. Brain waves were the most commonly employed body\nparameters for sleep staging and disorder studies. The convolutional neural\nnetwork, the most widely used of the 34 distinct artificial intelligence\nmodels, comprised 27%. The other models included the long short-term memory,\nsupport vector machine, random forest, and recurrent neural network, which\nconsisted of 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% sequentially. For performance metrics,\naccuracy was widely used for a maximum of 83.75% of the cases, the F1 score of\n45%, Kappa of 36.25%, Sensitivity of 31.25%, and Specificity of 30% of cases,\nalong with the other metrics. This article would help physicians and\nresearchers get the gist of AI's contribution to sleep studies and the\nfeasibility of their intended work.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7761\u7720\u5c0d\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5eb7\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u7761\u7720\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u4eba\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52d5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e00\u9805\u5305\u542b\u7761\u7720\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7761\u7720\u969c\u7919\u7684\u7761\u7720\u7814\u7a76\u5c0d\u65bc\u589e\u9032\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u500b\u4eba\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u6cc1\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u95dc\u65bc\u7761\u7720\u968e\u6bb5\u548c\u7761\u7720\u969c\u7919\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u591a\u5c0e\u7761\u7720\u63cf\u8a18\u8853\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5831\u544a\u6e2c\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u8a72\u7814\u7a76\u7d93\u904e\u5c08\u5bb6\u91ab\u5e2b\u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91dd\u5c0d\u5404\u7a2e\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u7684\u773e\u591a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u8853\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\uff0c\u7761\u7720\u968e\u6bb5\u5206\u985e\u548c\u7761\u7720\u969c\u7919\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u904e\u7a0b\u8b8a\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c0d\u8fd1\u671f\u6587\u737b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u3001\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u7684\u56de\u9867\u548c\u7d71\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u7761\u7720\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u9032\u884c\u7761\u7720\u968e\u6bb5\u5206\u985e\u548c\u7761\u7720\u969c\u7919\u6aa2\u6e2c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5728\u672c\u56de\u9867\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u671f\u520a\u4e2d\u9078\u51fa 183 \u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d 80 \u7bc7\u7d00\u9304\u88ab\u5217\u5165\u660e\u78ba\u7684\u56de\u9867\uff0c\u6642\u9593\u7bc4\u570d\u5f9e 2016 \u5e74\u5230 2023 \u5e74\u3002\u8166\u6ce2\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u548c\u969c\u7919\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8eab\u9ad4\u53c3\u6578\u3002\u5377\u7a4d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u662f 34 \u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u4f54 27%\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u62ec\u9577\u77ed\u671f\u8a18\u61b6\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f\u3001\u96a8\u6a5f\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u905e\u8ff4\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u4f9d\u5e8f\u4f54 11%\u30016%\u30016% \u548c 5%\u3002\u5728\u6548\u80fd\u6307\u6a19\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u6700\u591a 83.75% \u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0cF1 \u5206\u6578\u70ba 45%\uff0cKappa \u70ba 36.25%\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u70ba 31.25%\uff0c\u7279\u7570\u5ea6\u70ba 30% \u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c07\u5e6b\u52a9\u91ab\u5e2b\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5c0d\u7761\u7720\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u9810\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "author": "Tayab Uddin Wara et.al.", "authors": "Tayab Uddin Wara, Ababil Hossain Fahad, Adri Shankar Das, Md.

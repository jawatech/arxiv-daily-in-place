This article focuses on the problem of improving the effectiveness of\ncardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention, since CVD is the leading cause of\ndeath worldwide. To address this issue, a knowledge-based recommendation\nalgorithm was proposed to support self-management of CVD risk factors in adults\nat home. The proposed algorithm is based on the original multidimensional\nrecommendation model and on a new user profile model, which includes predictive\nassessments of CVD health in addition to its current ones as outlined in\nofficial guidelines. The main feature of the proposed algorithm is the\ncombination of rule-based logic with the capabilities of a large language model\nin generating human-like text for explanatory component of multidimensional\nrecommendation. The verification and evaluation of the proposed algorithm\nshowed the usefulness of the proposed recommendation algorithm for supporting\nadults in self-management of their CVD risk factors at home. As follows from\nthe comparison with similar knowledge-based recommendation algorithms, the\nproposed algorithm evaluates a larger number of CVD risk factors and has a\ngreater information and semantic capacity of the generated recommendations.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8da8\u52e2\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u50b3\u64ad\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5354\u52a9\u6c11\u773e\u7ba1\u7406\u81ea\u8eab\u5065\u5eb7\u3002\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u9ede\u63a2\u8a0e\u6539\u5584\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff08CVD\uff09\u9810\u9632\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba CVD \u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\u652f\u63f4\u6210\u4eba\u81ea\u6211\u7ba1\u7406 CVD \u98a8\u96aa\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u65bc\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u591a\u7dad\u5ea6\u63a8\u85a6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8f2a\u5ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9664\u4e86\u5b98\u65b9\u6307\u5357\u4e2d\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u8a55\u4f30\u5916\uff0c\u9084\u5305\u62ec CVD \u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u8272\u662f\u5c07\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u908f\u8f2f\u8207\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7d50\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u985e\u4eba\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u591a\u7dad\u5ea6\u63a8\u85a6\u7684\u8aaa\u660e\u6027\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9a57\u8b49\u548c\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5354\u52a9\u6210\u4eba\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u7ba1\u7406\u5176 CVD \u98a8\u96aa\u56e0\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u5f88\u6709\u7528\u3002\u5f9e\u8207\u985e\u4f3c\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e2d\u5f97\u77e5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u66f4\u591a CVD \u98a8\u96aa\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7522\u751f\u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u548c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "author": "Tatiana V.

{"2211.02943": {"publish_time": "2022-11-05", "title": "Predicting Treatment Adherence of Tuberculosis Patients at Scale", "paper_summary": "Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause of\ndeath, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new\ncases reported globally in $2020$. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the\nmedication regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus,\nproactively identifying patients at risk of dropping off their medication\nregimen enables corrective measures to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy\nmeasure of extreme non-adherence and a dataset of nearly $700,000$ patients\nfrom four states in India, we formulate and solve the machine learning (ML)\nproblem of early prediction of non-adherence based on a custom rank-based\nmetric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines, achieving a $\\sim\n100\\%$ lift over rule-based baselines and $\\sim 214\\%$ over a random\nclassifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We\ndeal with various issues in the process, including data quality,\nhigh-cardinality categorical data, low target prevalence, distribution shift,\nvariation across cohorts, algorithmic fairness, and the need for robustness and\nexplainability. Our findings indicate that risk stratification of non-adherent\npatients is a viable, deployable-at-scale ML solution. As the official AI\npartner of India's Central TB Division, we are working on multiple city and\nstate-level pilots with the goal of pan-India deployment.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Mihir Kulkarni et.al.", "authors": "Mihir Kulkarni,Satvik Golechha,Rishi Raj,Jithin Sreedharan,Ankit Bhardwaj,Santanu Rathod,Bhavin Vadera,Jayakrishna Kurada,Sanjay Mattoo,Rajendra Joshi,Kirankumar Rade,Alpan Raval", "id": "2211.02943v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02943v2", "repo": "null"}}

How can we apply\ncounterfactual-based methods to analyze and explain LLMs? We identify the\nfollowing key challenges. First, the generated textual counterfactuals should\nbe meaningful and readable to users and thus can be mentally compared to draw\nconclusions. Second, to make the solution scalable to long-form text, users\nshould be equipped with tools to create batches of counterfactuals from\nperturbations at various granularity levels and interactively analyze the\nresults. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and contribute 1) a\nnovel algorithm for generating batches of complete and meaningful textual\ncounterfactuals by removing and replacing text segments in different\ngranularities, and 2) LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization tool to help\nusers understand an LLM's behaviors by interactively inspecting and aggregating\nmeaningful counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by the\ngrammatical correctness of its generated counterfactuals using 1,000 samples\nfrom medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets. In our experiments,\n97.2% of the counterfactuals are grammatically correct. Through a use case,\nuser studies, and feedback from experts, we demonstrate the usefulness and\nusability of the proposed interactive visualization tool.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Furui Cheng et.al.", "authors": "Furui Cheng,Vil\u00e9m Zouhar,Robin Shing Moon Chan,Daniel F\u00fcrst,Hendrik Strobelt,Mennatallah El-Assady", "id": "2405.00708v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00708v1", "repo": "null"}}

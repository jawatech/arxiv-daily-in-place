In recent years, concerns have been raised about\nthe technical, clinical, ethical and legal risks associated with medical AI. To\nincrease real world adoption, it is essential that medical AI tools are trusted\nand accepted by patients, clinicians, health organisations and authorities.\nThis work describes the FUTURE-AI guideline as the first international\nconsensus framework for guiding the development and deployment of trustworthy\nAI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI consortium was founded in 2021 and\ncurrently comprises 118 inter-disciplinary experts from 51 countries\nrepresenting all continents, including AI scientists, clinicians, ethicists,\nand social scientists. Over a two-year period, the consortium defined guiding\nprinciples and best practices for trustworthy AI through an iterative process\ncomprising an in-depth literature review, a modified Delphi survey, and online\nconsensus meetings. The FUTURE-AI framework was established based on 6 guiding\nprinciples for trustworthy AI in healthcare, i.e. Fairness, Universality,\nTraceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Through consensus, a\nset of 28 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, legal\nand socio-ethical dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of\nmedical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment,\nand monitoring. FUTURE-AI is a risk-informed, assumption-free guideline which\nprovides a structured approach for constructing medical AI tools that will be\ntrusted, deployed and adopted in real-world practice. Researchers are\nencouraged to take the recommendations into account in proof-of-concept stages\nto facilitate future translation towards clinical practice of medical AI.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Karim Lekadir et.al.", "authors": "Karim Lekadir,Aasa Feragen,Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Alejandro F Frangi,Alena Buyx,Anais Emelie,Andrea Lara,Antonio R Porras,An-Wen Chan,Arcadi Navarro,Ben Glocker,Benard O Botwe,Bishesh Khanal,Brigit Beger,Carol C Wu,Celia Cintas,Curtis P Langlotz,Daniel Rueckert,Deogratias Mzurikwao,Dimitrios I Fotiadis,Doszhan Zhussupov,Enzo Ferrante,Erik Meijering,Eva Weicken,Fabio A Gonz\u00e1lez,Folkert W Asselbergs,Fred Prior,Gabriel P Krestin,Gary Collins,Geletaw S Tegenaw,Georgios Kaissis,Gianluca Misuraca,Gianna Tsakou,Girish Dwivedi,Haridimos Kondylakis,Harsha Jayakody,Henry C Woodruf,Hugo JWL Aerts,Ian Walsh,Ioanna Chouvarda,Ir\u00e8ne Buvat,Islem Rekik,James Duncan,Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer,Jihad Zahir,Jinah Park,John Mongan,Judy W Gichoya,Julia A Schnabel,Kaisar Kushibar,Katrine Riklund,Kensaku Mori,Kostas Marias,Lameck M Amugongo,Lauren A Fromont,Lena Maier-Hein,Leonor Cerd\u00e1 Alberich,Leticia Rittner,Lighton Phiri,Linda Marrakchi-Kacem,Llu\u00eds Donoso-Bach,Luis Mart\u00ed-Bonmat\u00ed,M Jorge Cardoso,Maciej Bobowicz,Mahsa Shabani,Manolis Tsiknakis,Maria A Zuluaga,Maria Bielikova,Marie-Christine Fritzsche,Marius George Linguraru,Markus Wenzel,Marleen De Bruijne,Martin G Tolsgaard,Marzyeh Ghassemi,Md Ashrafuzzaman,Melanie Goisauf,Mohammad Yaqub,Mohammed Ammar,M\u00f3nica Cano Abad\u00eda,Mukhtar M E Mahmoud,Mustafa Elattar,Nicola Rieke,Nikolaos Papanikolaou,Noussair Lazrak,Oliver D\u00edaz,Olivier Salvado,Oriol Pujol,Ousmane Sall,Pamela Guevara,Peter Gordebeke,Philippe Lambin,Pieta Brown,Purang Abolmaesumi,Qi Dou,Qinghua Lu,Richard Osuala,Rose Nakasi,S Kevin Zhou,Sandy Napel,Sara Colantonio,Shadi Albarqouni,Smriti Joshi,Stacy Carter,Stefan Klein,Steffen E Petersen,Susanna Auss\u00f3,Suyash Awate,Tammy Riklin Raviv,Tessa Cook,Tinashe E M Mutsvangwa,Wendy A Rogers,Wiro J Niessen,X\u00e8nia Puig-Bosch,Yi Zeng,Yunusa G Mohammed,Yves Saint James Aquino,Zohaib Salahuddin,Martijn P A Starmans", "id": "2309.12325v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12325v1", "repo": "null"}}

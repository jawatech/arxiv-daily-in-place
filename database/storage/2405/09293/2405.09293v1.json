An investigation with exhaustivity implicatures of Korean morphology", "paper_summary": "Markedness in natural language is often associated with non-literal meanings\nin discourse. Differential Object Marking (DOM) in Korean is one instance of\nthis phenomenon, where post-positional markers are selected based on both the\nsemantic features of the noun phrases and the discourse features that are\northogonal to the semantic features. Previous work has shown that\ndistributional models of language recover certain semantic features of words --\ndo these models capture implied discourse-level meanings as well? We evaluate\nwhether a set of large language models are capable of associating discourse\nmeanings with different object markings in Korean. Results suggest that\ndiscourse meanings of a grammatical marker can be more challenging to encode\nthan that of a discourse marker.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6a19\u8a18\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u8207\u8a71\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u7fa9\u6709\u95dc\u3002\u97d3\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u7570\u6027\u53d7\u683c\u6a19\u8a18 (DOM) \u5c31\u662f\u9019\u7a2e\u73fe\u8c61\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5f8c\u7f6e\u6a19\u8a18\u662f\u6839\u64da\u540d\u8a5e\u77ed\u8a9e\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u8207\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7279\u5fb5\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8a71\u8a9e\u7279\u5fb5\u4f86\u9078\u64c7\u7684\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u5fa9\u55ae\u8a5e\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u8a9e\u7fa9\u7279\u5fb5\u2014\u2014\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u96b1\u542b\u7684\u8a71\u8a9e\u7d1a\u5225\u610f\u7fa9\uff1f\u6211\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5920\u5c07\u8a71\u8a9e\u610f\u7fa9\u8207\u97d3\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u683c\u6a19\u8a18\u806f\u7e6b\u8d77\u4f86\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8a9e\u6cd5\u6a19\u8a18\u7684\u8a71\u8a9e\u610f\u7fa9\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8a71\u8a9e\u6a19\u8a18\u66f4\u96e3\u7de8\u78bc\u3002", "author": "Hagyeong Shin et.al.", "authors": "Hagyeong Shin, Sean Trott", "id": "2405.09293v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09293v1", "repo": "null"}}

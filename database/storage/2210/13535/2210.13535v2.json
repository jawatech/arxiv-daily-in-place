Precise burn injury classification is an important aspect of\nthe medical AI field. In this work, we propose an explainable human-in-the-loop\nframework for improving burn ultrasound classification models. Our framework\nleverages an explanation system based on the LIME classification explainer to\ncorroborate and integrate a burn expert's knowledge -- suggesting new features\nand ensuring the validity of the model. Using this framework, we discover that\nB-mode ultrasound classifiers can be enhanced by supplying textural features.\nMore specifically, we confirm that texture features based on the Gray Level\nCo-occurance Matrix (GLCM) of ultrasound frames can increase the accuracy of\ntransfer learned burn depth classifiers. We test our hypothesis on real data\nfrom porcine subjects. We show improvements in the accuracy of burn depth\nclassification -- from ~88% to ~94% -- once modified according to our\nframework.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Maxwell J.

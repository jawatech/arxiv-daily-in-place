However, existing\nmodels are usually tailored for a specific type of disease, and have been shown\nto lack generalizability across datasets. Furthermore, concerns have been\nraised recently towards the leakage of speaker identity from health embeddings.\nTo mitigate these limitations, we propose WavRx, a speech health diagnostics\nmodel that captures the respiration and articulation related dynamics from a\nuniversal speech representation. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments on\nsix pathological speech datasets demonstrate WavRx as a new state-of-the-art\nhealth diagnostic model. Furthermore, we show that the amount of speaker\nidentity entailed in the WavRx health embeddings is significantly reduced\nwithout extra guidance during training. An in-depth analysis of the model was\nperformed, thus providing physiological interpretation of its improved\ngeneralizability and privacy-preserving ability.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u97f3\u5df2\u77e5\u6703\u627f\u8f09\u8207\u5065\u5eb7\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u9060\u8ddd\u548c\u9577\u671f\u5065\u5eb7\u76e3\u63a7\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f91\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u91dd\u5c0d\u7279\u5b9a\u985e\u578b\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u91cf\u8eab\u6253\u9020\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u62ec\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u5c0d\u5f9e\u5065\u5eb7\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6d29\u6f0f\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u8eab\u5206\u63d0\u51fa\u7591\u616e\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa WavRx\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a9e\u97f3\u5065\u5eb7\u8a3a\u65b7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u6703\u64f7\u53d6\u4f86\u81ea\u901a\u7528\u8a9e\u97f3\u8868\u793a\u7684\u547c\u5438\u548c\u767c\u97f3\u76f8\u95dc\u52d5\u614b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u516d\u500b\u75c5\u7406\u6027\u8a9e\u97f3\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u7684\u9818\u57df\u5167\u548c\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u8b49\u660e WavRx \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u5065\u5eb7\u8a3a\u65b7\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u6c92\u6709\u984d\u5916\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\uff0cWavRx \u5065\u5eb7\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u8eab\u5206\u6578\u91cf\u5df2\u986f\u8457\u6e1b\u5c11\u3002\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5176\u6539\u5584\u7684\u6982\u62ec\u6027\u548c\u96b1\u79c1\u4fdd\u8b77\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u751f\u7406\u89e3\u91cb\u3002", "author": "Yi Zhu et.al.", "authors": "Yi Zhu, Tiago Falk", "id": "2406.18731v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18731v1", "repo": "https://github.com/zhu00121/wavrx"}}

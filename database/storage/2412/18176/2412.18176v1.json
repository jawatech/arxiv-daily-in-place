{"2412.18176": {"publish_time": "2024-12-24", "title": "Molar: Multimodal LLMs with Collaborative Filtering Alignment for Enhanced Sequential Recommendation", "paper_summary": "Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the\npast decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep\nlearning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While\nthe adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models\ninherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on\ntextual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve\noptimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose\nMolar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that\nintegrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture\ncollaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified\nitem representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating\ncomprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally,\nit incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment\nmechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based\nmodels, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly\ncombining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar\ncaptures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior\nrecommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar\nsignificantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its\nstrength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential\nrecommendation tasks.

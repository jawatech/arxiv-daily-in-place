However, it remains\nunclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while\nlearning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online\nself-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating\nAI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods\nresearch, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how\nCS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional\nonline methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students\napproach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students\nfound it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods\nthan using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use\nmore keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend\nto explicitly ask for information.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f8b\u5982 ChatGPT \u5df2\u88ab\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a1\u7528\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u5b78\u7fd2\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u76f8\u95dc\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u7684\u6210\u6548\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u70ba\u4f55\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5927\u591a\u6578\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u7dda\u4e0a\u81ea\u5b78\u7684\u7d93\u9a57\u90fd\u4f86\u81ea\u4f7f\u7528 Google \u7b49\u641c\u5c0b\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u6b64\u8108\u7d61\u4e2d\u8a55\u4f30 AI \u5de5\u5177\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u53d7\u8a66\u8005\u5167\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3 CS2 \u5b78\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u548c\u50b3\u7d71\u7dda\u4e0a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6559\u80b2\u7db2\u7ad9\u548c\u5f71\u7247\uff09\u5b78\u7fd2\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a2d\u8a08\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8a0e\u5b78\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5169\u7a2e\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u548c\u8de8\u60c5\u5883\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u5b78\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b78\u7fd2\u8f03\u56f0\u96e3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528 ChatGPT \u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u641c\u5c0b\u5f15\u64ce\u6642\u6703\u63d0\u51fa\u8f03\u5c11\u7684\u8ffd\u8e64\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u57fa\u65bc\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u7684\u67e5\u8a62\uff0c\u800c\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d LLM \u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5247\u50be\u5411\u65bc\u660e\u78ba\u8981\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002", "author": "Aayush Kumar et.al.", "authors": "Aayush Kumar, Daniel Prol, Amin Alipour, Sruti Srinivasa Ragavan", "id": "2501.11935v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11935v1", "repo": "null"}}

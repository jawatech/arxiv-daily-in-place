By including additional context in prompts, we\ncomprehensively analyze LLM's sensitivity to geographical priming, persona\nattributes, and numerical information to assess how well the needs of various\ngroups are reflected. Our findings on two LLMs, five languages, and six\ndatasets reveal that mimicking persona-based attributes leads to annotation\nvariability. Meanwhile, incorporating geographical signals leads to better\nregional alignment. We also find that the LLMs are sensitive to numerical\nanchors, indicating the ability to leverage community-based flagging efforts\nand exposure to adversaries. Our work provides preliminary guidelines and\nhighlights the nuances of applying LLMs in culturally sensitive cases.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u65bc\u4e3b\u89c0\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4ec7\u6068\u5075\u6e2c\uff0c\u4eba\u5011\u5c0d\u4ec7\u6068\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u9ad4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u984d\u5916\u7684\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790 LLM \u5c0d\u5730\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u5c6c\u6027\u548c\u6578\u5b57\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u9ad4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5f97\u5230\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5169\u500b LLM\u3001\u4e94\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u516d\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u57fa\u65bc\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5c6c\u6027\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u8a3b\u89e3\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u7d0d\u5165\u5730\u7406\u8a0a\u865f\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5340\u57df\u5c0d\u9f4a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe\uff0cLLM \u5c0d\u6578\u5b57\u9328\u9ede\u5f88\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u793a\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u6a19\u8a18\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u5c0d\u5c0d\u624b\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u61c9\u7528 LLM \u7684\u7d30\u5fae\u5dee\u5225\u3002", "author": "Sarah Masud et.al.", "authors": "Sarah Masud, Sahajpreet Singh, Viktor Hangya, Alexander Fraser, Tanmoy Chakraborty", "id": "2410.02657v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02657v1", "repo": "null"}}

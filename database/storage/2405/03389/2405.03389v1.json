However, using\nk-fold cross-validation instead of holdout validation drastically increases the\ncomputational cost of validating a single configuration. While ensuring better\ngeneralization and, by extension, better performance, the additional cost is\noften prohibitive for effective model selection within a time budget. We aim to\nmake model selection with cross-validation more effective. Therefore, we study\nearly stopping the process of cross-validation during model selection. We\ninvestigate the impact of early stopping on random search for two algorithms,\nMLP and random forest, across 36 classification datasets. We further analyze\nthe impact of the number of folds by considering 3-, 5-, and 10-folds. In\naddition, we investigate the impact of early stopping with Bayesian\noptimization instead of random search and also repeated cross-validation. Our\nexploratory study shows that even a simple-to-understand and easy-to-implement\nmethod consistently allows model selection to converge faster; in ~94% of all\ndatasets, on average by ~214%. Moreover, stopping cross-validation enables\nmodel selection to explore the search space more exhaustively by considering\n+167% configurations on average within one hour, while also obtaining better\noverall performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Edward Bergman et.al.", "authors": "Edward Bergman,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter", "id": "2405.03389v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03389v1", "repo": "null"}}

Through 3dsMax animation software and OpenCV module,\nself-build image dataset of geometrically stable system and geometrically\nunstable system. we construct and train convolutional neural network model\nbased on the TensorFlow and Keras deep learning platform framework. The model\nachieves 100% accuracy on the training set, validation set, and test set. The\naccuracy on the additional test set is 93.7%, indicating that convolutional\nneural network can learn and master the relevant knowledge of kinematic\nanalysis of structural mechanics. In the future, the generalization ability of\nthe model can be improved through the diversity of dataset, which has the\npotential to surpass human experts for complex structures. Convolutional neural\nnetwork has certain practical value in the field of kinematic analysis of\nstructural mechanics. Using visualization technology, we reveal how\nconvolutional neural network learns and recognizes structural features. Using\npre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning, we found that\nthe generalization ability is inferior to the self-built model.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Leye Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Leye Zhang,Xiangxiang Tian,Hongjun Zhang", "id": "2405.02807v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02807v1", "repo": "https://github.com/zhangleye/Kinematic-Analysis"}}

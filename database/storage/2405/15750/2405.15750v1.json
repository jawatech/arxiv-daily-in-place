We apply the\nmethod to both LSTM and Transformer LMs (of roughly comparable size),\ndeveloping filtered corpora that target a wide range of linguistic phenomena.\nOur results show that while transformers are better qua LMs (as measured by\nperplexity), both models perform equally and surprisingly well on linguistic\ngeneralization measures, suggesting that they are capable of generalizing from\nindirect evidence.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u904e\u6ffe\u8a9e\u6599\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5728\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\u904e\u6ffe\u6389\u7279\u5b9a\u8a9e\u8a00\u7d50\u69cb\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LM) \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u7528\u65bc\u8861\u91cf LM \u5728\u9593\u63a5\u8b49\u64da\u57fa\u790e\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\u8a9e\u8a00\u6982\u62ec\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc LSTM \u548c Transformer LM\uff08\u5927\u5c0f\u5927\u81f4\u76f8\u7576\uff09\uff0c\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u91dd\u5c0d\u5404\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u73fe\u8c61\u7684\u904e\u6ffe\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u96d6\u7136 Transformer \u5728 LM \u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73fe\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\uff08\u6839\u64da\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8a9e\u8a00\u6982\u62ec\u6e2c\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73fe\u5f97\u540c\u6a23\u597d\u4e14\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5f9e\u9593\u63a5\u8b49\u64da\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u6982\u62ec\u3002", "author": "Abhinav Patil et.al.", "authors": "Abhinav Patil, Jaap Jumelet, Yu Ying Chiu, Andy Lapastora, Peter Shen, Lexie Wang, Clevis Willrich, Shane Steinert-Threlkeld", "id": "2405.15750v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15750v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, these models do not fully capture the\ncomplexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in\nisolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for\ninfants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a\nSpatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the\ndifferent types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language\nlearning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary\nacquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the\ndifferent types of linguistic relationships that occur during language\nacquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm\nselection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models\nfor predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and\nsemantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with\na 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some\nrelationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in\nidentifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should\nsubsequently learn than others (such as auditory).", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u9810\u6e2c\u5152\u7ae5\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\u5c07\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u8a5e\u5f59\u5c0d\u65bc\u4fc3\u9032\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u7528\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u7d61\u6280\u8853\uff08\u89c0\u5bdf\u8a5e\u5f59\u72c0\u614b\u96a8\u6642\u9593\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\uff09\u9084\u662f\u5716\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u89c0\u5bdf\u8207\u8a5e\u5f59\u4e4b\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6578\u64da\uff09\uff0c\u9019\u985e\u9810\u6e2c\u90fd\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u55ae\u7368\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6642\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4e26\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5b30\u5152\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u69cb\u5efa\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u5b30\u5e7c\u5152\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u5176\u9069\u61c9\u65bc\u6642\u7a7a\u5716\u5377\u7a4d\u7db2\u7d61 (STGCN)\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u8003\u616e\u5230\u5152\u7ae5\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u9810\u6e2c\u5152\u7ae5\u8a5e\u5f59\u7fd2\u5f97\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u95dc\u4fc2\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u6e96\u548c\u898f\u7bc4\u9078\u64c7\u7522\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u898b\u89e3\u3002\u5c0d\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u89ba\u904b\u52d5\u95dc\u4fc2 (0.733) \u548c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u95dc\u4fc2 (0.729) \u9810\u6e2c\u65b0\u8a5e\u5f59\u6642\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u512a\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u5169\u5c64\u524d\u994b\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u7d61\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u95dc\u4fc2\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u8996\u89ba\uff09\u5728\u8b58\u5225\u5152\u7ae5\u96a8\u5f8c\u61c9\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u8a5e\u5f59\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u95dc\u4fc2\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u807d\u89ba\uff09\u3002</paragraph>\n", "author": "Andrew Roxburgh et.al.", "authors": "Andrew Roxburgh, Floriana Grasso, Terry R.

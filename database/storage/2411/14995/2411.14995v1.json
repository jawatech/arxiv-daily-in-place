In this work, a\nnovel approach is introduced which, like the well-known LOCM systems, is\nscalable, but like SAT approaches, is sound and complete. Furthermore, the\napproach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the\nnumber or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an\n\\emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a\npredicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with\nspecific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and\naction patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain\nthat is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates. The new\nmethod is studied theoretically and experimentally. For the latter, the method\nis evaluated on traces and graphs obtained from standard classical domains like\nthe 8-puzzle, which involve hundreds of thousands of states and transitions.\nThe learned representations are then verified on larger instances.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u50c5\u5f9e\u52d5\u4f5c\u8ecc\u8de1\u5b78\u7fd2 STRIPS \u52d5\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u9805\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u6d89\u53ca\u5b78\u7fd2\u9818\u57df\u8b02\u8a5e\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u773e\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684 LOCM \u7cfb\u7d71\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5c31\u50cf SAT \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5065\u5168\u4e14\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u5c0d\u96b1\u85cf\u57df\u6216\u8b02\u8a5e\u7684\u6578\u91cf\u6216\u5143\u6578\u6c92\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002\u65b0\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u65bc\u4e00\u500b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6e2c\u8a66\uff0c\u8a72\u6e2c\u8a66\u6aa2\u67e5\u5047\u8a2d\u8b02\u8a5e\u53d7\u4e00\u7d44\u52d5\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5373\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u53c3\u6578\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff09\u5f71\u97ff\u662f\u5426\u8207\u8ecc\u8de1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u901a\u904e\u6e2c\u8a66\u7684\u8b02\u8a5e\u548c\u52d5\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u70ba\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u9818\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f15\u9b06\u5730\u7528\u5148\u6c7a\u689d\u4ef6\u548c\u975c\u614b\u8b02\u8a5e\u5b8c\u6210\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u3002\u5c0d\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8ad6\u548c\u5be6\u9a57\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u5f8c\u8005\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f9e\u6a19\u6e96\u7d93\u5178\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6d89\u53ca\u6578\u5341\u842c\u500b\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u8f49\u63db\u7684 8-puzzle\uff09\u7372\u5f97\u7684\u8ecc\u8de1\u548c\u5716\u5f62\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9a57\u8b49\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "author": "Jonas G\u00f6sgens et.al.", "authors": "Jonas G\u00f6sgens, Niklas Jansen, Hector Geffner", "id": "2411.14995v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14995v1", "repo": "null"}}

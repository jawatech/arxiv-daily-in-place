{"2409.16788": {"publish_time": "2024-09-25", "title": "Mitigating the Bias of Large Language Model Evaluation", "paper_summary": "Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM)\nquality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to\nevaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be\nbiased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial\nquality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following\nability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of\nLLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply\ncalibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on\nprobability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to\nmitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that\ndeviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our\nmethods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our\nmethods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory\nevaluation accuracy.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u8a55\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u662f LLM-as-a-Judge\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5229\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u500b LLM \u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u54c1\u8cea\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u8a55\u5be9\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u6709\u504f\u898b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u6703\u504f\u597d\u5448\u73fe\u8f03\u4f73\u8868\u9762\u54c1\u8cea\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5197\u9577\u3001\u6d41\u66a2\uff09\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u95dc\u65bc LLM-as-a-Judge \u504f\u898b\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u9589\u6e90\u8a55\u5be9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u61c9\u7528\u6821\u6e96\u4f86\u6e1b\u8f15\u8868\u9762\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u5728\u6a5f\u7387\u5c64\u7d1a\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u5c64\u7d1a\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u958b\u6e90\u8a55\u5be9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u900f\u904e\u5c0d\u6bd4\u8a13\u7df4\u4f86\u6e1b\u8f15\u504f\u898b\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u96e2\u6307\u4ee4\u4f46\u5448\u73fe\u8f03\u4f73\u8868\u9762\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u8ca0\u9762\u6a23\u672c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u504f\u898b\u8a55\u4f30\u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u5957\u7528\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7dad\u6301\u6eff\u610f\u8a55\u4f30\u7cbe\u6e96\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u6e1b\u8f15\u4e86\u504f\u898b\u3002", "author": "Hongli Zhou et.al.", "authors": "Hongli Zhou, Hui Huang, Yunfei Long, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Hailong Cao, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao", "id": "2409.16788v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16788v1", "repo": "null"}}

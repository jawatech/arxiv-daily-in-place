We take a first\nstep towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing that\ndefense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of the\nequation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive)\npersuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for only\none side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive\nand negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (or PBT),\nwhich leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains\nmodels via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT\nconsistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to being\nchallenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holistic\ndata containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show that\nPBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates. We find that without\nPBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with the\norder in which the models present their answers determining whether the team\nobtains the stronger or weaker model's performance. PBT leads to better and\nmore stable results and less order dependence, with the stronger model\nconsistently pulling the weaker one up.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8aaa\u670d\uff0c\u7576\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u5c0d\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u5c0d\u8a71\u8005\u6642\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u9020\u6210\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u53d6\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u4f86\u4fdd\u8b77\u6a21\u578b\u514d\u65bc\u8aaa\u670d\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u4e3b\u5f35\u9632\u79a6\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\uff08\u5373\u8ca0\u9762\uff09\u8aaa\u670d\u50c5\u662f\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u61c9\u8a72\u80fd\u5920\u63a5\u53d7\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff08\u5373\u6b63\u9762\u7684\uff09\u8aaa\u670d\u4f86\u6539\u5584\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u50c5\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e00\u65b9\u512a\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u8ca0\u9762\u8aaa\u670d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8aaa\u670d\u5e73\u8861\u8a13\u7df4\uff08\u6216 PBT\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e3b\u9ad4\u905e\u8ff4\u5c0d\u8a71\u6a39\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u504f\u597d\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u9069\u7576\u6642\u63a5\u53d7\u8aaa\u670d\u3002PBT \u6301\u7e8c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0d\u932f\u8aa4\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u9ad8\u61c9\u5c0d\u6311\u6230\u7684\u97cc\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5728\u5305\u542b\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u8ca0\u9762\u8aaa\u670d\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u4e5f\u7522\u751f\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e PBT \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e3b\u9ad4\u8faf\u8ad6\u4e2d\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u968a\u53cb\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u6c92\u6709 PBT\uff0c\u6210\u5c0d\u7684\u8f03\u5f37\u548c\u8f03\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73fe\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u6c7a\u5b9a\u4e86\u5718\u968a\u7372\u5f97\u8f03\u5f37\u6216\u8f03\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002PBT \u5c0e\u5411\u66f4\u597d\u3001\u66f4\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f03\u5c11\u7684\u9806\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8cf4\u6027\uff0c\u8f03\u5f37\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7e8c\u63d0\u5347\u8f03\u5f31\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Elias Stengel-Eskin et.al.", "authors": "Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal", "id": "2410.14596v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14596v1", "repo": "https://github.com/esteng/persuasion_balanced_training"}}

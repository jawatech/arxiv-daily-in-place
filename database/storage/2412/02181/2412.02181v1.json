However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce\nsuboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture\ncomplex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive\nand efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel\ngeneralized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop\nneighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture\nricher structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our\napproach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for\nneighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic\nbenchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets\nwhile reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5b50\u5716\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u5404\u7a2e\u73fe\u5be6\u554f\u984c\u4e0a\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u5176\u6548\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u7531\u65bc\u7121\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5b50\u5716\u5167\u90e8\u548c\u5b50\u5716\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5b50\u5716\u5c64\u7d1a\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7522\u751f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u4e26\u975e\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u9054\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 WLKS\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) \u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u5c07 WL \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5957\u7528\u5728\u611f\u61c9 $k$-\u8df3\u9130\u57df\u4e0a\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u63a8\u5ee3\u5230\u5b50\u5716\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7d50\u5408\u4e0d\u540c $k$-\u8df3\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u6838\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u7de8\u78bc\u7684\u66f4\u8c50\u5bcc\u7d50\u69cb\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u80fd\u900f\u904e\u6d88\u9664\u9130\u57df\u62bd\u6a23\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73fe\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u516b\u500b\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0cWLKS \u5728\u4e94\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u986f\u8457\u512a\u65bc\u9818\u5148\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u7e2e\u77ed\u8a13\u7df4\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u8207\u73fe\u6709\u6280\u8853\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7bc4\u570d\u5f9e 0.01x \u5230 0.25x\u3002", "author": "Dongkwan Kim et.al.", "authors": "Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh", "id": "2412.02181v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02181v1", "repo": "https://github.com/dongkwan-kim/wlks"}}

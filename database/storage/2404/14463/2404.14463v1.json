The DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews\nconducted by a human-controlled virtual agent, has been widely used for this\ntask. Recent studies have reported enhanced performance when incorporating\ninterviewer's prompts into the model. In this work, we hypothesize that this\nimprovement might be mainly due to a bias present in these prompts, rather than\nthe proposed architectures and methods. Through ablation experiments and\nqualitative analysis, we discover that models using interviewer's prompts learn\nto focus on a specific region of the interviews, where questions about past\nexperiences with mental health issues are asked, and use them as discriminative\nshortcuts to detect depressed participants. In contrast, models using\nparticipant responses gather evidence from across the entire interview.\nFinally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve a 0.90 F1 score by\nintentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported to date on this\ndataset using only textual information. Our findings underline the need for\ncaution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as they may\ninadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning to\ncharacterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the\npatient's mental health condition.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Sergio Burdisso et.al.", "authors": "Sergio Burdisso,Ernesto Reyes-Ram\u00edrez,Esa\u00fa Villatoro-Tello,Fernando S\u00e1nchez-Vega,Pastor L\u00f3pez-Monroy,Petr Motlicek", "id": "2404.14463v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14463v1", "repo": "null"}}

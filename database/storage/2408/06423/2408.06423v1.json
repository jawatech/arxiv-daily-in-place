{"2408.06423": {"publish_time": "2024-08-12", "title": "Evaluating Language Models on Entity Disambiguation in Tables", "paper_summary": "Tables are crucial containers of information, but understanding their meaning\nmay be challenging. Indeed, recently, there has been a focus on Semantic Table\nInterpretation (STI), i.e., the task that involves the semantic annotation of\ntabular data to disambiguate their meaning. Over the years, there has been a\nsurge in interest in data-driven approaches based on deep learning that have\nincreasingly been combined with heuristic-based approaches. In the last period,\nthe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new category of\napproaches for table annotation. The interest in this research field,\ncharacterised by multiple challenges, has led to a proliferation of approaches\nemploying different techniques. However, these approaches have not been\nconsistently evaluated on a common ground, making evaluation and comparison\ndifficult. This work proposes an extensive evaluation of four state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches - Alligator (formerly s-elBat), Dagobah, TURL, and\nTableLlama; the first two belong to the family of heuristic-based algorithms,\nwhile the others are respectively encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs. The\nprimary objective is to measure the ability of these approaches to solve the\nentity disambiguation task, with the ultimate aim of charting new research\npaths in the field.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8868\u683c\u662f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u8f09\u9ad4\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u542b\u7fa9\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u3002\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u8a9e\u610f\u8868\u683c\u8a6e\u91cb (STI) \u53d7\u5230\u95dc\u6ce8\uff0c\u5373\u6d89\u53ca\u8868\u683c\u8cc7\u6599\u8a9e\u610f\u8a3b\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5176\u542b\u7fa9\u7684\u6b67\u7fa9\u3002\u591a\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u65e5\u76ca\u8207\u57fa\u65bc\u555f\u767c\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7d50\u5408\u3002\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u985e\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u683c\u8a3b\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c0d\u9019\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u9ede\u662f\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u63a1\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u8853\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6fc0\u589e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u5171\u540c\u57fa\u790e\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5f97\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f03\u8b8a\u5f97\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c0d\u56db\u7a2e\u6700\u5148\u9032 (SOTA) \u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u8a55\u4f30\u2014\u2014Alligator\uff08\u4ee5\u524d\u7a31\u70ba s-elBat\uff09\u3001Dagobah\u3001TURL \u548c TableLlama\uff1b\u524d\u5169\u7a2e\u5c6c\u65bc\u57fa\u65bc\u555f\u767c\u5f0f\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u5169\u7a2e\u5206\u5225\u662f\u50c5\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u548c\u50c5\u89e3\u78bc\u5668 LLM\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u6c7a\u5be6\u9ad4\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u7fa9\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6700\u7d42\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7e6a\u88fd\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f91\u3002", "author": "Federico Belotti et.al.", "authors": "Federico Belotti, Fabio Dadda, Marco Cremaschi, Roberto Avogadro, Riccardo Pozzi, Matteo Palmonari", "id": "2408.06423v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06423v1", "repo": "null"}}

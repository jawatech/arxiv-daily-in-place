Utility Estimation with LLM-based Simulations", "paper_summary": "Asking questions is a fundamental aspect of learning that facilitates deeper\nunderstanding. However, characterizing and crafting questions that effectively\nimprove learning remains elusive. To address this gap, we propose QUEST\n(Question Utility Estimation with Simulated Tests). QUEST simulates a learning\nenvironment that enables the quantification of a question's utility based on\nits direct impact on improving learning outcomes. Furthermore, we can identify\nhigh-utility questions and use them to fine-tune question generation models\nwith rejection sampling. We find that questions generated by models trained\nwith rejection sampling based on question utility result in exam scores that\nare higher by at least 20% than those from specialized prompting grounded on\neducational objectives literature and models fine-tuned with indirect measures\nof question quality, such as saliency and expected information gain.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63d0\u554f\u662f\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u5c64\u9762\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u4fc3\u9032\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u69cb\u5efa\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u6548\u7684\u554f\u984c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u96e3\u4ee5\u6349\u6478\u7684\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 QUEST\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u64ec\u6e2c\u9a57\u4f30\u8a08\u554f\u984c\u6548\u7528\uff09\u3002QUEST \u6a21\u64ec\u4e00\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u6839\u64da\u554f\u984c\u5c0d\u6539\u5584\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u554f\u984c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u5011\u4f86\u5fae\u8abf\u57fa\u65bc\u62d2\u7d55\u62bd\u6a23\u7684\u51fa\u984c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u554f\u984c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u62d2\u7d55\u62bd\u6a23\u8a13\u7df4\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5176\u8003\u8a66\u5206\u6578\u81f3\u5c11\u6bd4\u90a3\u4e9b\u57fa\u65bc\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u6a19\u6587\u737b\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u554f\u984c\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u9593\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u6a19\u6e96\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u986f\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9810\u671f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u589e\u76ca\uff09\u5fae\u8abf\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u554f\u984c\u9ad8\u51fa 20%\u3002", "author": "Dong-Ho Lee et.al.", "authors": "Dong-Ho Lee, Hyundong Cho, Jonathan May, Jay Pujara", "id": "2502.17383v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17383v1", "repo": "null"}}

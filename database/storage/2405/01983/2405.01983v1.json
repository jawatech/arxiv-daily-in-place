Machine learning\n(ML) has proven successful in protein design, reducing the need for expensive\nwet lab experiment rounds. However, challenges persist in efficiently exploring\nthe protein fitness landscapes to identify optimal protein designs. In\nresponse, we propose the use of AlphaZero to generate protein backbones,\nmeeting shape and structural scoring requirements. We extend an existing Monte\nCarlo tree search (MCTS) framework by incorporating a novel threshold-based\nreward and secondary objectives to improve design precision. This innovation\nconsiderably outperforms existing approaches, leading to protein backbones that\nbetter respect structural scores. The application of AlphaZero is novel in the\ncontext of protein backbone design and demonstrates promising performance.\nAlphaZero consistently surpasses baseline MCTS by more than 100% in top-down\nprotein design tasks. Additionally, our application of AlphaZero with secondary\nobjectives uncovers further promising outcomes, indicating the potential of\nmodel-based reinforcement learning (RL) in navigating the intricate and nuanced\naspects of protein design", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Frederic Renard et.al.", "authors": "Frederic Renard,Cyprien Courtot,Alfredo Reichlin,Oliver Bent", "id": "2405.01983v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01983v1", "repo": "null"}}

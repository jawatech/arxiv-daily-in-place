Self-learning, where a model is made to learn from its\noutput, is one approach to exploit such data. However, it has been shown that\ntoo much of this data can be detrimental to the performance of the model if the\navailable parallel data is comparatively extremely low. In this study, we\ninvestigate whether the monolingual data can also be too little and if this\nreduction, based on quality, has any effect on the performance of the\ntranslation model. Experiments have shown that on English-German low-resource\nNMT, it is often better to select only the most useful additional data, based\non quality or closeness to the domain of the test data, than utilizing all of\nthe available data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u91cf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u55ae\u8a9e\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u5347\u7d1a\u6578\u91cf\u7a00\u5c11\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a13\u7df4\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u81ea\u5b78\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u6703\u5f9e\u5176\u8f38\u51fa\u7d50\u679c\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u985e\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5df2\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8cc7\u6599\u76f8\u5c0d\u6975\u5c11\uff0c\u90a3\u9ebc\u904e\u591a\u7684\u6b64\u985e\u8cc7\u6599\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u640d\u5bb3\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u55ae\u8a9e\u8cc7\u6599\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u592a\u5c11\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u65bc\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u9019\u7a2e\u6e1b\u5c11\u662f\u5426\u5c0d\u7ffb\u8b6f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8a9e-\u5fb7\u8a9e\u4f4e\u8cc7\u6e90 NMT \u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u54c1\u8cea\u6216\u8207\u6e2c\u8a66\u8cc7\u6599\u9818\u57df\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u50c5\u9078\u53d6\u6700\u6709\u7528\u7684\u984d\u5916\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "author": "Idris Abdulmumin et.al.", "authors": "Idris Abdulmumin, Bashir Shehu Galadanci, Garba Aliyu, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad", "id": "2410.13783v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13783v1", "repo": "null"}}

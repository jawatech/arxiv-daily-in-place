Traditional loss functions such as cross-entropy and binary\ncross-entropy are often inadequate due to their inability to address the\nimbalances between the classes with high representation and the classes with\nlow representation found in medical image datasets. We introduce a novel\npolynomial loss function based on Pade approximation, designed specifically to\novercome the challenges associated with long-tailed classification. This\napproach incorporates asymmetric sampling techniques to better classify\nunder-represented classes. We conducted extensive evaluations on three publicly\navailable medical datasets and a proprietary medical dataset. Our\nimplementation of the proposed loss function is open-sourced in the public\nrepository:https://github.com/ipankhi/ALPA.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u4e2d\u7684\u9577\u5c3e\u554f\u984c\u6e90\u65bc\u6578\u64da\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u4e0d\u540c\u91ab\u7642\u72c0\u6cc1\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u548c\u8868\u73fe\u5b58\u5728\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4fdd\u8b49\u4e86\u5c0d\u7cbe\u78ba\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u985e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u50b3\u7d71\u640d\u5931\u51fd\u6578\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u89e3\u6c7a\u91ab\u7642\u5f71\u50cf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u985e\u5225\u8207\u8868\u793a\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u985e\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc Pade \u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u591a\u9805\u5f0f\u640d\u5931\u51fd\u6578\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u514b\u670d\u8207\u9577\u5c3e\u5206\u985e\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u975e\u5c0d\u7a31\u62bd\u6a23\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5c0d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u985e\u5225\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4e09\u500b\u516c\u958b\u7684\u91ab\u7642\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u6709\u91ab\u7642\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u63d0\u8b70\u640d\u5931\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u5be6\u4f5c\u5df2\u5728\u516c\u5171\u5132\u5b58\u5eab\u4e2d\u958b\u6e90\uff1ahttps://github.com/ipankhi/ALPA\u3002", "author": "Pankhi Kashyap et.al.", "authors": "Pankhi Kashyap, Pavni Tandon, Sunny Gupta, Abhishek Tiwari, Ritwik Kulkarni, Kshitij Sharad Jadhav", "id": "2410.04084v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04084v1", "repo": "null"}}

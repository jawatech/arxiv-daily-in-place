Compared to directly scaling general\nabilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least one task,\nsurpassing human experts, while also retaining general abilities. This fusion\npath enables SGI to rapidly achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into\nthree stages based on the level of mastery over professional skills and\ngenerality performance. Additionally, we discuss the necessity of SGI in\naddressing issues associated with large language models, such as their\ninsufficient generality, specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation,\nand practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for\ndeveloping SGI that integrates the strengths of Systems 1 and 2 cognitive\nprocessing. This framework comprises three layers and four key components,\nwhich focus on enhancing individual abilities and facilitating collaborative\nevolution. We conclude by summarizing the potential challenges and suggesting\nfuture directions. We hope that the proposed SGI will provide insights into\nfurther research and applications towards achieving AGI.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c08\u696d\u901a\u624d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (SGAI \u6216\u7c21\u7a31 SGI) \u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8996\u70ba\u9081\u5411\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u6167 (AGI) \u7684\u95dc\u9375\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002\u8207\u76f4\u63a5\u64f4\u5c55\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSGI \u88ab\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u8868\u73fe\u512a\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u5c08\u5bb6\u7684 AI\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u878d\u5408\u8def\u5f91\u4f7f SGI \u80fd\u5920\u5feb\u901f\u5be6\u73fe\u9ad8\u50f9\u503c\u9818\u57df\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u5c0d\u5c08\u696d\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u8868\u73fe\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c07 SGI \u5206\u70ba\u4e09\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u6c7a\u8207\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5c08\u696d\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5275\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\uff09\u4e2d SGI \u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7d71 1 \u548c 2 \u8a8d\u77e5\u8655\u7406\u512a\u52e2\u7684 SGI \u958b\u767c\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5c64\u548c\u56db\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u589e\u5f37\u500b\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4fc3\u9032\u5354\u4f5c\u6f14\u9032\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e86\u6f5b\u5728\u6311\u6230\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SGI \u80fd\u70ba\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u61c9\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe AGI\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Kaiyan Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Kaiyan Zhang, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou", "id": "2407.08642v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08642v1", "repo": "null"}}

Recently, many works on SLU that treat it as a\nsequence-to-sequence task have achieved great success. However, This method is\nnot suitable for simultaneous speech recognition and understanding. In this\npaper, we propose a joint speech recognition and structure learning framework\n(JSRSL), an end-to-end SLU model based on span, which can accurately transcribe\nspeech and extract structured content simultaneously. We conduct experiments on\nname entity recognition and intent classification using the Chinese dataset\nAISHELL-NER and the English dataset SLURP. The results show that our proposed\nmethod not only outperforms the traditional sequence-to-sequence method in both\ntranscription and extraction capabilities but also achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the two datasets.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u53e3\u8a9e\u7406\u89e3 (SLU) \u662f\u8a9e\u97f3\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u9810\u6e2c\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u5c07 SLU \u8996\u70ba\u5e8f\u5217\u5c0d\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u8a9e\u97f3\u8b58\u5225\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u806f\u5408\u8a9e\u97f3\u8b58\u5225\u548c\u7d50\u69cb\u5b78\u7fd2\u6846\u67b6 (JSRSL)\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc span \u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef SLU \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u8f49\u9304\u8a9e\u97f3\u4e26\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u53d6\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u5167\u5bb9\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u6578\u64da\u96c6 AISHELL-NER \u548c\u82f1\u6587\u6578\u64da\u96c6 SLURP \u9032\u884c\u4e86\u547d\u540d\u5be6\u9ad4\u8b58\u5225\u548c\u610f\u5716\u5206\u985e\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u50c5\u5728\u8f49\u9304\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u512a\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5c0d\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5169\u500b\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Jiliang Hu et.al.", "authors": "Jiliang Hu, Zuchao Li, Mengjia Shen, Haojun Ai, Sheng Li, Jun Zhang", "id": "2501.07329v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07329v1", "repo": "null"}}

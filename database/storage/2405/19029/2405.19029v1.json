{"2405.19029": {"publish_time": "2024-05-29", "title": "Convex neural network synthesis for robustness in the 1-norm", "paper_summary": "With neural networks being used to control safety-critical systems, they\nincreasingly have to be both accurate (in the sense of matching inputs to\noutputs) and robust. However, these two properties are often at odds with each\nother and a trade-off has to be navigated. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a method to generate an approximation of a neural network which is\ncertifiably more robust. Crucially, the method is fully convex and posed as a\nsemi-definite programme. An application to robustifying model predictive\ncontrol is used to demonstrate the results. The aim of this work is to\nintroduce a method to navigate the neural network robustness/accuracy\ntrade-off.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u88ab\u7528\u65bc\u63a7\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u95dc\u9375\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5fc5\u9808\u65e2\u6e96\u78ba\uff08\u5728\u5c07\u8f38\u5165\u8207\u8f38\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u4e0a\uff09\u53c8\u5065\u5168\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u5169\u500b\u7279\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u76f8\u4e92\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5fc5\u9808\u6b0a\u8861\u53d6\u6368\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\uff0c\u8a72\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\u7d93\u904e\u8b49\u660e\u66f4\u5065\u5168\u3002\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u51f8\u51fa\u4e26\u4f5c\u70ba\u534a\u5b9a\u660e\u78ba\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u7528\u65bc\u52a0\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7528\u65bc\u5c55\u793a\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u61c9\u5c0d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5065\u5168\u6027/\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u6b0a\u8861\u3002", "author": "Ross Drummond et.al.", "authors": "Ross Drummond, Chris Guiver, Matthew C.

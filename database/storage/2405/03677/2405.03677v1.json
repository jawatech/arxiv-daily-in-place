In this exploratory work, we\ntake a first step towards adopting a human-in-the-loop prompt engineering\napproach with GPT-4-Turbo to summarize and categorize students' synergistic\nlearning during collaborative discourse. Our preliminary findings suggest\nGPT-4-Turbo may be able to characterize students' synergistic learning in a\nmanner comparable to humans and that our approach warrants further\ninvestigation.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Clayton Cohn et.al.", "authors": "Clayton Cohn,Caitlin Snyder,Justin Montenegro,Gautam Biswas", "id": "2405.03677v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03677v1", "repo": "null"}}

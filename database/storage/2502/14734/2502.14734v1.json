{"2502.14734": {"publish_time": "2025-02-20", "title": "Sentence Smith: Formally Controllable Text Transformation and its Application to Evaluation of Text Embedding Models", "paper_summary": "We propose the Sentence Smith framework that enables controlled and specified\nmanipulation of text meaning. It consists of three main steps: 1. Parsing a\nsentence into a semantic graph, 2. Applying human-designed semantic\nmanipulation rules, and 3. Generating text from the manipulated graph. A final\nfiltering step (4.) ensures the validity of the applied transformation. To\ndemonstrate the utility of Sentence Smith in an application study, we use it to\ngenerate hard negative pairs that challenge text embedding models. Since the\ncontrollable generation makes it possible to clearly isolate different types of\nsemantic shifts, we can gain deeper insights into the specific strengths and\nweaknesses of widely used text embedding models, also addressing an issue in\ncurrent benchmarking where linguistic phenomena remain opaque. Human validation\nconfirms that the generations produced by Sentence Smith are highly accurate.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa Sentence Smith \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u4e26\u6307\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u542b\u7fa9\u7684\u8655\u7406\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u6b65\u9a5f\uff1a1. \u5c07\u53e5\u5b50\u89e3\u6790\u6210\u8a9e\u7fa9\u5716\u5f62\uff0c2. \u5957\u7528\u4eba\u70ba\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u8655\u7406\u898f\u5247\uff0c3. \u5f9e\u8655\u7406\u904e\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u904e\u6ffe\u6b65\u9a5f (4.) \u78ba\u4fdd\u5957\u7528\u8f49\u63db\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5728\u61c9\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a Sentence Smith \u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u6311\u6230\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56f0\u96e3\u8ca0\u9762\u5c0d\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u9694\u96e2\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u8f49\u79fb\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u9ad4\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u8a9e\u8a00\u73fe\u8c61\u5728\u7576\u524d\u57fa\u6e96\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u4eba\u70ba\u9a57\u8b49\u78ba\u8a8d Sentence Smith \u7522\u751f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6e96\u78ba\u3002", "author": "Hongji Li et.al.", "authors": "Hongji Li, Andrianos Michail, Reto Gubelmann, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz", "id": "2502.14734v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14734v1", "repo": "null"}}

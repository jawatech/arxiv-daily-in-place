Along with this increase, there has been the\nemergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods aimed at\ngenerating additional explanations regarding how the model makes certain\npredictions. In this sense, methods such as Dalex, Eli5, eXirt, Lofo and Shap\nemerged as different proposals and methodologies for generating explanations of\nblack box models in an agnostic way. Along with the emergence of these methods,\nquestions arise such as \"How Reliable and Stable are XAI Methods?\". With the\naim of shedding light on this main question, this research creates a pipeline\nthat performs experiments using the diabetes dataset and four different machine\nlearning models (LGBM, MLP, DT and KNN), creating different levels of\nperturbations of the test data and finally generates explanations from the\neXirt method regarding the confidence of the models and also feature relevances\nranks from all XAI methods mentioned, in order to measure their stability in\nthe face of perturbations. As a result, it was found that eXirt was able to\nidentify the most reliable models among all those used. It was also found that\ncurrent XAI methods are sensitive to perturbations, with the exception of one\nspecific method.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u65e5\u76ca\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (XAI) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u51fa\u67d0\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e2a\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u8bb2\uff0cDalex\u3001Eli5\u3001eXirt\u3001Lofo \u548c Shap \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u8bf8\u5982\u201cXAI \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u201d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9610\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08LGBM\u3001MLP\u3001DT \u548c KNN\uff09\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4ece eXirt \u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u6240\u6709 XAI \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0ceXirt \u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684 XAI \u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Jos\u00e9 Ribeiro et.al.", "authors": "Jos\u00e9 Ribeiro, Lucas Cardoso, Vitor Santos, Eduardo Carvalho, N\u00edkolas Carneiro, Ronnie Alves", "id": "2407.03108v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03108v1", "repo": "null"}}

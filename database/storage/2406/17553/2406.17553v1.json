In this work, we investigate the use of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to predict the sequence of actions taken by the Builder.\nLeveraging LLMs' in-context learning abilities, we use few-shot prompting\ntechniques, that significantly improve performance over baseline methods.\nAdditionally, we present a detailed analysis of the gaps in performance for\nfuture work", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728 Minecraft \u5354\u4f5c\u5efa\u9020\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\uff0c\u5169\u4f4d\u73a9\u5bb6\u5354\u4f5c\uff1a\u4e00\u540d\u5efa\u7bc9\u5e2b (A) \u5411\u4e00\u540d\u5efa\u9020\u8005 (B) \u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 3D \u65b9\u584a\u7d44\u88dd\u4e00\u500b\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u5efa\u9020\u8005\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\u9806\u5e8f\u3002\u5229\u7528 LLM \u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5b78\u7fd2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u6b21\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u91dd\u5c0d\u6548\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u51fa\u8a73\u7d30\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u65bc\u5f8c\u7e8c\u5de5\u4f5c", "author": "Chalamalasetti Kranti et.al.", "authors": "Chalamalasetti Kranti, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen", "id": "2406.17553v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17553v1", "repo": "null"}}

As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,\nfairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)\ncommunity has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity,\nespecially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses\nanother facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a\nvital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide\nhuman decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first\nsystematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive\nmodels (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both\nindividual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics\nand society. We have found, through a hybrid method of theoretical reasoning,\nsimulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity\naxioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,\nhealth care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary\nresearch at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and\nhuman-computer interactions (HCIs). By evidencing the catastrophic consequences\nif monotonicity is not met, we address the significance of monotonicity\nrequirements in AI applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MNAMs are an\neffective fairness-aware ML approach by imposing monotonicity restrictions\nintegrating human intelligence.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Dangxing Chen et.al.", "authors": "Dangxing Chen,Luyao Zhang", "id": "2301.07060v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07060v1", "repo": "null"}}

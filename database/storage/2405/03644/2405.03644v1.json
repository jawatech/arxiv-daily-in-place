Despite\ninitial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a\nlack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper bridge this\ngap by providing a systematic literature review, encompassing an analysis of\nover 180 works, spanning across 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios.\nOur comprehensive overview addresses three critical research questions: the\nconstruction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, LLMs' applications in various\ncybersecurity tasks, and the existing challenges and further research in this\narea. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in\nenhancing cybersecurity practices, and serve as a valuable resource for\napplying LLMs in this doamin. We also maintain and regularly updated list of\npractical guides on LLMs for cybersecurity at\nhttps://github.com/tmylla/Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Jie Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Jie Zhang,Haoyu Bu,Hui Wen,Yu Chen,Lun Li,Hongsong Zhu", "id": "2405.03644v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03644v1", "repo": "null"}}

Since these LLMs are trained on huge corpuses of data\nfrom the web and other sources, there has been a major concern about harmful\nprejudices that may potentially be transferred from the data. In many\napplications, these pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on task specific datasets,\nwhich can further contribute to biases. This paper studies the extent of biases\nabsorbed by LLMs during pre-training as well as task-specific behaviour after\nfine-tuning. We found that controlled interventions on pre-trained LLMs, prior\nto fine-tuning, have minimal effect on lowering biases in classifiers. However,\nthe biases present in domain-specific datasets play a much bigger role, and\nhence mitigating them at this stage has a bigger impact. While pre-training\ndoes matter, but after the model has been pre-trained, even slight changes to\nco-occurrence rates in the fine-tuning dataset has a significant effect on the\nbias of the model.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u57fa\u65bcTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u548c\u5927\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5df2\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u9019\u4e9b LLM \u662f\u6839\u64da\u7db2\u969b\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c0d\u65bc\u53ef\u80fd\u5f9e\u8cc7\u6599\u50b3\u905e\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u504f\u898b\u5b58\u5728\u8457\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u7591\u616e\u3002\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 LLM \u6703\u91dd\u5c0d\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u9020\u6210\u504f\u898b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e LLM \u5728\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u5438\u6536\u7684\u504f\u898b\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u8abf\u5f8c\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8abf\u4e4b\u524d\u5c0d\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 LLM \u9032\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u4ecb\u5165\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u985e\u5668\u7684\u504f\u898b\u5f71\u97ff\u751a\u5fae\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u504f\u898b\u626e\u6f14\u4e86\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u6b64\u968e\u6bb5\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u4e9b\u504f\u898b\u6703\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u5f8c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u8abf\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u5171\u73fe\u7387\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u8b8a\u5316\u4e5f\u6703\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u898b\u7522\u751f\u986f\u8457\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Arkadeep Baksi et.al.", "authors": "Arkadeep Baksi, Rahul Singh, Tarun Joshi", "id": "2408.00612v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00612v1", "repo": "null"}}

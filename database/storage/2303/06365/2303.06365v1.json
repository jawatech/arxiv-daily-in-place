For time series, where the input is often not\ninterpretable, only limited research on XAI is available. In this work, we put\nforward a virtual inspection layer, that transforms the time series to an\ninterpretable representation and allows to propagate relevance attributions to\nthis representation via local XAI methods like layer-wise relevance propagation\n(LRP). In this way, we extend the applicability of a family of XAI methods to\ndomains (e.g. speech) where the input is only interpretable after a\ntransformation. Here, we focus on the Fourier transformation which is\nprominently applied in the interpretation of time series and LRP and refer to\nour method as DFT-LRP. We demonstrate the usefulness of DFT-LRP in various time\nseries classification settings like audio and electronic health records. We\nshowcase how DFT-LRP reveals differences in the classification strategies of\nmodels trained in different domains (e.g., time vs. frequency domain) or helps\nto discover how models act on spurious correlations in the data.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Johanna Vielhaben et.al.", "authors": "Johanna Vielhaben,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Gr\u00e9goire Montavon,Wojciech Samek", "id": "2303.06365v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06365v1", "repo": "null"}}

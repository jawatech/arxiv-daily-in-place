This\nprogress is particularly relevant to the medical domain, where the quality and\nsensitivity of data pose unique challenges for model training and application.\nHowever, the dependency on high-quality data for effective in-context learning\nraises questions about the feasibility of these models when encountering with\nthe inevitable variations and errors inherent in real-world medical data. In\nthis paper, we introduce MID-M, a novel framework that leverages the in-context\nlearning capabilities of a general-domain Large Language Model (LLM) to process\nmultimodal data via image descriptions. MID-M achieves a comparable or superior\nperformance to task-specific fine-tuned LMMs and other general-domain ones,\nwithout the extensive domain-specific training or pre-training on multimodal\ndata, with significantly fewer parameters. This highlights the potential of\nleveraging general-domain LLMs for domain-specific tasks and offers a\nsustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional LMM developments.\nMoreover, the robustness of MID-M against data quality issues demonstrates its\npractical utility in real-world medical domain applications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Seonhee Cho et.al.", "authors": "Seonhee Cho,Choonghan Kim,Jiho Lee,Chetan Chilkunda,Sujin Choi,Joo Heung Yoon", "id": "2405.01591v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01591v1", "repo": "null"}}

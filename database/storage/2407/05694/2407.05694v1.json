{"2407.05694": {"publish_time": "2024-07-08", "title": "On the Limitations of Compute Thresholds as a Governance Strategy", "paper_summary": "At face value, this essay is about understanding a fairly esoteric governance\ntool called compute thresholds. However, in order to grapple with whether these\nthresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be.\nThis requires engaging with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer\nscience progress, namely, is bigger always better? Hence, this essay may be of\ninterest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also to computer\nscientists interested in understanding the role of compute in unlocking\nbreakthroughs. Does a certain inflection point of compute result in changes to\nthe risk profile of a model? This discussion is increasingly urgent given the\nwide adoption of governance approaches that suggest greater compute equates\nwith higher propensity for harm. Several leading frontier AI companies have\nreleased responsible scaling policies. Both the White House Executive Orders on\nAI Safety (EO) and the EU AI Act encode the use of FLOP or floating-point\noperations as a way to identify more powerful systems. What is striking about\nthe choice of compute thresholds to-date is that no models currently deployed\nin the wild fulfill the current criteria set by the EO. This implies that the\nemphasis is often not on auditing the risks and harms incurred by currently\ndeployed models - but rather is based upon the belief that future levels of\ncompute will introduce unforeseen new risks. A key conclusion of this essay is\nthat compute thresholds as currently implemented are shortsighted and likely to\nfail to mitigate risk. Governance that is overly reliant on compute fails to\nunderstand that the relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain\nand rapidly changing. It also overestimates our ability to predict what\nabilities emerge at different scales. This essay ends with recommendations for\na better way forward.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5f9e\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u770b\uff0c\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u662f\u95dc\u65bc\u4e86\u89e3\u4e00\u500b\u76f8\u7576\u6df1\u5967\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u8a08\u7b97\u95be\u503c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u70ba\u4e86\u63a2\u8a0e\u9019\u4e9b\u95be\u503c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u9054\u6210\u4efb\u4f55\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5fc5\u9808\u5148\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u5011\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u7522\u751f\u7684\u3002\u9019\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e\u96fb\u8166\u79d1\u5b78\u9032\u6b65\u6838\u5fc3\u6b77\u7d93\u6578\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u8faf\u8ad6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7e3d\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u55ce\uff1f\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u4e0d\u50c5\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0d\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u5ee3\u5927\u6c11\u773e\u611f\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0d\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u4e86\u89e3\u8a08\u7b97\u5728\u89e3\u9396\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u9032\u5c55\u4e2d\u6240\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u96fb\u8166\u79d1\u5b78\u5bb6\u611f\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u8a08\u7b97\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u62d0\u9ede\u662f\u5426\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u98a8\u96aa\u6982\u6cc1\u7684\u6539\u8b8a\uff1f\u9451\u65bc\u5ee3\u6cdb\u63a1\u7528\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8a08\u7b97\u7b49\u65bc\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u50be\u5411\uff0c\u9019\u5834\u8a0e\u8ad6\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u8feb\u5207\u3002\u5e7e\u5bb6\u9818\u5148\u7684\u5c16\u7aef AI \u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7d93\u767c\u5e03\u4e86\u8ca0\u8cac\u4efb\u7684\u64f4\u5c55\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u767d\u5bae\u95dc\u65bc AI \u5b89\u5168\u7684\u884c\u653f\u547d\u4ee4 (EO) \u548c\u6b50\u76df AI \u6cd5\u6848\u90fd\u7de8\u78bc\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6d6e\u9ede\u904b\u7b97 (FLOP) \u4f5c\u70ba\u8b58\u5225\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fc4\u4eca\u70ba\u6b62\u9078\u64c7\u8a08\u7b97\u95be\u503c\u7684\u9a5a\u4eba\u4e4b\u8655\u5728\u65bc\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6c92\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7b26\u5408 EO \u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u7576\u524d\u6a19\u6e96\u3002\u9019\u610f\u5473\u8457\u91cd\u9ede\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5728\u65bc\u5be9\u67e5\u7576\u524d\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u548c\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u672a\u4f86\u8a08\u7b97\u5c64\u7d1a\u5c07\u5f15\u5165\u7121\u6cd5\u9810\u898b\u7684\u65b0\u98a8\u96aa\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u7d50\u8ad6\u662f\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5be6\u65bd\u7684\u8a08\u7b97\u95be\u503c\u76ee\u5149\u77ed\u6dfa\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u7121\u6cd5\u6e1b\u8f15\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u904e\u65bc\u4f9d\u8cf4\u8a08\u7b97\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u7121\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u8a08\u7b97\u548c\u98a8\u96aa\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u4e14\u8b8a\u5316\u8fc5\u901f\u3002\u5b83\u4e5f\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u9810\u6e2c\u4e0d\u540c\u898f\u6a21\u51fa\u73fe\u4f55\u7a2e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u9019\u7bc7\u8ad6\u6587\u6700\u5f8c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u524d\u9032\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u3002", "author": "Sara Hooker et.al.", "authors": "Sara Hooker", "id": "2407.05694v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05694v1", "repo": "null"}}

We\nintroduce a scheme for the annotation of difficulties which is based on\nempirical research in psychology as well as on research in translation studies.\nThe paper describes the annotated dataset, primarily derived from the parallel\ntexts (standard English and Easy to Read English translations) made available\nonline. we fine-tuned four different pre-trained transformer models to perform\nthe task of multiclass classification to predict the strategies required for\nsimplification. We also investigate the possibility to interpret the decisions\nof this language model when it is aimed at predicting the difficulty of\nsentences.

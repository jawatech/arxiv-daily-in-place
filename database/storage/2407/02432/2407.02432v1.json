Despite their importance, ADEs are often under-reported in official\nchannels. Some research has therefore turned to detecting discussions of ADEs\nin social media. Impressive results have been achieved in various attempts to\ndetect ADEs. In a high-stakes domain such as medicine, however, an in-depth\nevaluation of a model's abilities is crucial. We address the issue of thorough\nperformance evaluation in English-language ADE detection with hand-crafted\ntemplates for four capabilities: Temporal order, negation, sentiment, and\nbeneficial effect. We find that models with similar performance on held-out\ntest sets have varying results on these capabilities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u85e5\u7269\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u61c9 (ADE) \u662f\u4efb\u4f55\u56e0\u85e5\u7269\u6cbb\u7642\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5b83\u5011\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46 ADE \u7d93\u5e38\u5728\u5b98\u65b9\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u88ab\u4f4e\u5831\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u8f49\u5411\u5075\u6e2c\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e2d\u5c0d ADE \u7684\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u5728\u5075\u6e2c ADE \u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u5617\u8a66\u4e2d\uff0c\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u7b49\u9ad8\u98a8\u96aa\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4ee5\u624b\u5de5\u88fd\u4f5c\u7684\u7bc4\u672c\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u82f1\u6587 ADE \u5075\u6e2c\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u9805\u80fd\u529b\u9032\u884c\u5fb9\u5e95\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u8a55\u4f30\uff1a\u6642\u9593\u9806\u5e8f\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u60c5\u7dd2\u548c\u6709\u76ca\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5728\u7559\u5b58\u6e2c\u8a66\u96c6\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u985e\u4f3c\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u537b\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "author": "Dorothea MacPhail et.al.", "authors": "Dorothea MacPhail, David Harbecke, Lisa Raithel, Sebastian M\u00f6ller", "id": "2407.02432v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02432v1", "repo": "null"}}

The subgroups of $S_{n}$ arise, among many\nother contexts, to describe label symmetry of classical images with respect to\nspatial transformations, e.g. reflection or rotation. Equipped with the\nformalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this work we propose the\narchitectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs)\nadherent to $S_{n}$ and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of\npixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for\nsmall subgroups of $S_{n}$. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the\nfull permutation group $S_{n}$ is built by applying all possible QCNNs with\nequal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in\nquantum neural networks. For subgroups of $S_{n}$, our numerical results using\nMNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs.\nThe $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training\nand test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected\nand non-connected graphs. When trained with sufficiently large number of data,\nthe $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN shows better average performance compared to\n$S_{n}$-equivariant QNN . These results contribute towards building powerful\nquantum machine learning architectures in permutation-symmetric systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Sreetama Das et.al.", "authors": "Sreetama Das,Filippo Caruso", "id": "2404.18198v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18198v1", "repo": "null"}}

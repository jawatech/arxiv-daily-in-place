{"2502.03984": {"publish_time": "2025-02-06", "title": "PGB: One-Shot Pruning for BERT via Weight Grouping and Permutation", "paper_summary": "Large pretrained language models such as BERT suffer from slow inference and\nhigh memory usage, due to their huge size. Recent approaches to compressing\nBERT rely on iterative pruning and knowledge distillation, which, however, are\noften too complicated and computationally intensive. This paper proposes a\nnovel semi-structured one-shot pruning method for BERT, called\n$\\textit{Permutation and Grouping for BERT}$ (PGB), which achieves high\ncompression efficiency and sparsity while preserving accuracy. To this end, PGB\nidentifies important groups of individual weights by permutation and prunes all\nother weights as a structure in both multi-head attention and feed-forward\nlayers. Furthermore, if no important group is formed in a particular layer, PGB\ndrops the entire layer to produce an even more compact model. Our experimental\nresults on BERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ demonstrate that PGB outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art structured pruning methods in terms of computational cost and\naccuracy preservation.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 BERT\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u9f90\u5927\u898f\u6a21\uff0c\u6703\u9020\u6210\u63a8\u8ad6\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u8a18\u61b6\u9ad4\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u9ad8\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u58d3\u7e2e BERT \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u53cd\u8986\u526a\u679d\u548c\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u904e\u65bc\u8907\u96dc\u4e14\u8a08\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba BERT \u7684\u6392\u5217\u548c\u5206\u7d44 (PGB)\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u9ad8\u58d3\u7e2e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0cPGB \u900f\u904e\u6392\u5217\u8b58\u5225\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u7fa4\u7d44\u7684\u500b\u5225\u6b0a\u91cd\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6b0a\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u70ba\u591a\u982d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u524d\u994b\u5c64\u4e2d\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5c64\u4e2d\u6c92\u6709\u5f62\u6210\u91cd\u8981\u7fa4\u7d44\uff0cPGB \u6703\u522a\u9664\u6574\u500b\u5c64\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u7dca\u6e4a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728 BERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ \u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPGB \u5728\u8a08\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Hyemin Lim et.al.", "authors": "Hyemin Lim, Jaeyeon Lee, Dong-Wan Choi", "id": "2502.03984v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03984v1", "repo": "null"}}

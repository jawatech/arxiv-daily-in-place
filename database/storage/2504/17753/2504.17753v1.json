{"2504.17753": {"publish_time": "2025-04-24", "title": "Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT", "paper_summary": "Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in\nhealthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real\nstakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more\ntraditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a\nwithin-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant\nthat allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One\nversion of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,\nand one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is\nmore accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on\nChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors\nand requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no\npreference for one over the other.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5c0d\u8a71\u5f0f\u52a9\u7406\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8207\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u95dc\u8005\u9032\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a81\u986f\u66f4\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u548c\u57fa\u65bc\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u512a\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u7fa4\u9ad4\u5167\u7528\u6236\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f03\u5169\u500b\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u5f0f\u52a9\u7406\uff0c\u5141\u8a31\u5fc3\u81df\u8870\u7aed\u60a3\u8005\u8a62\u554f\u98df\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u9e7d\u542b\u91cf\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7248\u672c\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f\u67b6\u69cb\u5167\u90e8\u958b\u767c\u7684\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5247\u57fa\u65bc ChatGPT\u3002\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5167\u90e8\u958b\u767c\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u6bd4\u57fa\u65bc ChatGPT \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u7c21\u6f54\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc ChatGPT \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u8a9e\u97f3\u932f\u8aa4\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\u4e5f\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u5c0d\u5169\u8005\u6c92\u6709\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u3002</paragraph>\n", "author": "Anuja Tayal et.al.", "authors": "Anuja Tayal, Devika Salunke, Barbara Di Eugenio, Paula Allen-Meares, Eulalia Puig Abril, Olga Garcia, Carolyn Dickens, Andrew Boyd", "id": "2504.17753v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1", "repo": "null"}}

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the\ntask, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The\ninterpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the\nresearchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model\n(LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific\nthemes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic\nsimilarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing\nrepresentations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a\nnorm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for\nfollow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation\nof most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity\ngreater than 0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the\nrepresentation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition),\nindicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of\ninfluencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to\ninvestigate the effects of Sample Size, Abstract Degree, and Focus Points on\ndrawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children\nrepresented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u4f7f\u7528\u5152\u7ae5\u7e6a\u756b\u4f86\u6aa2\u8996\u5176\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u5be6\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u554f\u984c\uff1a1. \u7e6a\u756b\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u904e\u65bc\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u800c\u7d50\u8ad6\u7684\u751f\u614b\u6548\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff1b2. \u5c0d\u7e6a\u756b\u7684\u8a6e\u91cb\u904e\u65bc\u4f9d\u8cf4\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u4e3b\u89c0\u611f\u53d7\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4f86\u8b58\u5225 1420 \u5e45\u5152\u7ae5\u79d1\u5b78\u7e6a\u756b\uff08\u6db5\u84cb 9 \u500b\u79d1\u5b78\u4e3b\u984c/\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528 word2vec \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8a08\u7b97\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u8a9e\u7fa9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u662f\u5426\u5152\u7ae5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e3b\u984c\u4e0a\u6709\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7e6a\u756b\u8868\u5fb5\uff0c\u4e26\u8a66\u5716\u70ba\u5152\u7ae5\u79d1\u5b78\u7e6a\u756b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u898f\u7bc4\uff0c\u70ba\u5f8c\u7e8c\u5152\u7ae5\u7e6a\u756b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\u53c3\u8003\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6578\u7e6a\u756b\u7684\u8868\u5fb5\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u73fe\u70ba\u5927\u591a\u6578\u8a9e\u7fa9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5927\u65bc 0.8\u3002\u540c\u6642\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u8868\u5fb5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8207\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\uff08LLM \u7684\u8b58\u5225\uff09\u7121\u95dc\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5728\u5f8c\u7e8c\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u56e0\u7d20\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528 Kendall \u7b49\u7d1a\u76f8\u95dc\u4fc2\u6578\u4f86\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a23\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u62bd\u8c61\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7126\u9ede\u9ede\u5c0d\u7e6a\u756b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u8a5e\u983b\u7d71\u8a08\u4f86\u63a2\u8a0e\u5152\u7ae5\u662f\u5426\u901a\u904e\u91cd\u73fe\u8ab2\u5802\u4e0a\u6240\u6559\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u4f86\u8868\u5fb5\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u4e3b\u984c/\u6982\u5ff5\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Yi Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yi Zhang, Fan Wei, Jingyi Li, Yan Wang, Yanyan Yu, Jianli Chen, Zipo Cai, Xinyu Liu, Wei Wang, Peng Wang, Zhong Wang", "id": "2502.15348v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15348v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2501.13826": {"publish_time": "2025-01-23", "title": "Video-MMMU: Evaluating Knowledge Acquisition from Multi-Discipline Professional Videos", "paper_summary": "Humans acquire knowledge through three cognitive stages: perceiving\ninformation, comprehending knowledge, and adapting knowledge to solve novel\nproblems. Videos serve as an effective medium for this learning process,\nfacilitating a progression through these cognitive stages. However, existing\nvideo benchmarks fail to systematically evaluate the knowledge acquisition\ncapabilities in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). To address this gap, we\nintroduce Video-MMMU, a multi-modal, multi-disciplinary benchmark designed to\nassess LMMs' ability to acquire and utilize knowledge from videos. Video-MMMU\nfeatures a curated collection of 300 expert-level videos and 900\nhuman-annotated questions across six disciplines, evaluating knowledge\nacquisition through stage-aligned question-answer pairs: Perception,\nComprehension, and Adaptation. A proposed knowledge gain metric,\n{\\Delta}knowledge, quantifies improvement in performance after video viewing.\nEvaluation of LMMs reveals a steep decline in performance as cognitive demands\nincrease and highlights a significant gap between human and model knowledge\nacquisition, underscoring the need for methods to enhance LMMs' capability to\nlearn and adapt from videos.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u985e\u900f\u904e\u4e09\u500b\u8a8d\u77e5\u968e\u6bb5\u4f86\u7372\u53d6\u77e5\u8b58\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9069\u61c9\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b0\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5f71\u7247\u4f5c\u70ba\u6b64\u5b78\u7fd2\u6b77\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u4fc3\u9032\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u8a8d\u77e5\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u5f71\u7247\u57fa\u6e96\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u8a55\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u6a21\u578b (LMM) \u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Video-MMMU\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u3001\u591a\u9818\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8a55\u4f30 LMM \u5f9e\u5f71\u7247\u4e2d\u7372\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002Video-MMMU \u5177\u6709\u7d93\u904e\u7b56\u5c55\u7684 300 \u500b\u5c08\u5bb6\u7d1a\u5f71\u7247\u548c 900 \u500b\u8de8\u516d\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6a19\u8a3b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u8207\u968e\u6bb5\u5c0d\u9f4a\u7684\u554f\u984c\u56de\u7b54\u5c0d\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u3002\u4e00\u500b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u6307\u6a19 {\\Delta}knowledge\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u89c0\u770b\u5f71\u7247\u5f8c\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5c0d LMM \u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u96a8\u8457\u8a8d\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6548\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e26\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u4eba\u985e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8b58\u7372\u53d6\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u589e\u5f37 LMM \u5f9e\u5f71\u7247\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "author": "Kairui Hu et.al.", "authors": "Kairui Hu, Penghao Wu, Fanyi Pu, Wang Xiao, Yuanhan Zhang, Xiang Yue, Bo Li, Ziwei Liu", "id": "2501.13826v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13826v1", "repo": "null"}}

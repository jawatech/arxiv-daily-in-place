Despite this linguistic diversity,\nresearch on Sentiment Analysis has predominantly focused on English text data,\nresulting in a disproportionate availability of sentiment resources for\nEnglish. This paper examines the performance of transformer models in Sentiment\nAnalysis tasks across multilingual datasets and text that has undergone machine\ntranslation. By comparing the effectiveness of these models in different\nlinguistic contexts, we gain insights into their performance variations and\npotential implications for sentiment analysis across diverse languages. We also\ndiscuss the shortcomings and potential for future work towards the end.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Aekansh Kathunia et.al.", "authors": "Aekansh Kathunia,Mohammad Kaif,Nalin Arora,N Narotam", "id": "2405.02887v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02887v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, its learning mechanism is fundamentally\ndifferent from that of supervised learning. Previous works have shown that\ndifficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples\naround the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning,\ncontribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps\nsurprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples,\nalthough reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification\nperformance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs\nof samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough\ntheoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples\nnegatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin\ntuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby\nimproving performance. Empirically, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism\nfor selecting difficult-to-learn examples and validate the effectiveness of the\naforementioned methods, which substantiates the reliability of our proposed\ntheoretical framework.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u986f\u8457\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u8207\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u7684\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u76f8\u5339\u6575\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a5f\u5236\u8207\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u6709\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff08\u5728\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u516c\u8a8d\u70ba\u6c7a\u7b56\u908a\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u5f0f\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u8ca2\u737b\u751a\u5fae\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u76f4\u63a5\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u6703\u6e1b\u5c11\u6a23\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u985e\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u627e\u51fa\u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u69cb\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7406\u8ad6\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5c0d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9032\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u7406\u8ad6\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5fb9\u5e95\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7522\u751f\u8ca0\u9762\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u79fb\u9664\u9019\u4e9b\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u908a\u754c\u8abf\u6574\u548c\u6eab\u5ea6\u8abf\u6574\u7b49\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f37\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u7d93\u9a57\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a5f\u5236\u4f86\u9078\u64c7\u96e3\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e26\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u8b49\u5be6\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8ad6\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "author": "Yi-Ge Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yi-Ge Zhang, Jingyi Cui, Qiran Li, Yisen Wang", "id": "2501.01317v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01317v1", "repo": "null"}}

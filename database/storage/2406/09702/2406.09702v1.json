However, having all the contents\nof the response with given knowledge or facts is not necessarily a good thing\nin dialogues. This study aimed to achieve both attractiveness and factuality in\na dialogue response for which a task was set to predict sentences that do not\nrequire factual correctness judgment such as agreeing, or personal\nopinions/feelings. We created a dataset, dialogue dataset annotated with\nfact-check-needed label (DDFC), for this task via crowdsourcing, and\nclassification tasks were performed on several models using this dataset. The\nmodel with the highest classification accuracy could yield about 88% accurate\nclassification results.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u986f\u8457\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u78ba\u4fdd\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u9805\u6311\u6230\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5c0d\u8a71\u4e2d\uff0c\u8b93\u56de\u61c9\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5167\u5bb9\u90fd\u5177\u5099\u65e2\u5b9a\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u6216\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e26\u975e\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u4ef6\u597d\u4e8b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5c0d\u8a71\u56de\u61c9\u4e2d\u540c\u6642\u5be6\u73fe\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u6027\uff0c\u70ba\u6b64\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5373\u9810\u6e2c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5be6\u6b63\u78ba\u6027\u5224\u65b7\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u540c\u610f\u6216\u500b\u4eba\u610f\u898b/\u611f\u53d7\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u7fa4\u773e\u5916\u5305\u70ba\u6b64\u4efb\u52d9\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5e36\u6709\u4e8b\u5be6\u67e5\u6838\u6a19\u7c64\u7684\u5c0d\u8a71\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 (DDFC)\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u5c0d\u591a\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u57f7\u884c\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7522\u751f\u7d04 88% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5206\u985e\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "author": "Ryohei Kamei et.al.", "authors": "Ryohei Kamei, Daiki Shiono, Reina Akama, Jun Suzuki", "id": "2406.09702v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09702v1", "repo": "null"}}

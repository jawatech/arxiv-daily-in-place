To address this, we\npropose CurrMask, a curriculum masking pretraining paradigm for sequential\ndecision making. Motivated by how humans learn by organizing knowledge in a\ncurriculum, CurrMask adjusts its masking scheme during pretraining for learning\nversatile skills. Through extensive experiments, we show that CurrMask exhibits\nsuperior zero-shot performance on skill prompting tasks, goal-conditioned\nplanning tasks, and competitive finetuning performance on offline RL tasks.\nAdditionally, our analysis of training dynamics reveals that CurrMask gradually\nacquires skills of varying complexity by dynamically adjusting its masking\nscheme.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u906e\u7f69\u9810\u6e2c\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u906e\u7f69\u65b9\u6848\u800c\u6210\u70ba\u96e2\u7dda\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2 (RL) \u4e2d\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7d71\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9748\u6d3b\u63a8\u8ad6\u5404\u7a2e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u906e\u7f69\u9810\u6e2c\u5177\u6709\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u8907\u96dc\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u6b64\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CurrMask\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u7528\u65bc\u5e8f\u8cab\u6c7a\u7b56\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\u906e\u7f69\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u985e\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u904e\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7d44\u7e54\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f\u555f\u767c\uff0cCurrMask \u5728\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u8abf\u6574\u5176\u906e\u7f69\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5b78\u7fd2\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u904e\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e CurrMask \u5728\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u793a\u4efb\u52d9\u3001\u76ee\u6a19\u689d\u4ef6\u898f\u5283\u4efb\u52d9\u548c\u96e2\u7dda RL \u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u5fae\u8abf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u512a\u7570\u7684\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u8a13\u7df4\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cCurrMask \u901a\u904e\u52d5\u614b\u8abf\u6574\u5176\u906e\u7f69\u65b9\u6848\u9010\u6f38\u7fd2\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\u8907\u96dc\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Yao Tang et.al.", "authors": "Yao Tang, Zhihui Xie, Zichuan Lin, Deheng Ye, Shuai Li", "id": "2410.17744v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17744v1", "repo": "https://github.com/yaotang23/currmask"}}

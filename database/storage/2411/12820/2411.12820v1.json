We argue that such regulation should require\ndevelopers to explicitly identify and justify key underlying assumptions about\nevaluations as part of their case for safety. We identify core assumptions in\nAI evaluations (both for evaluating existing models and forecasting future\nmodels), such as comprehensive threat modeling, proxy task validity, and\nadequate capability elicitation. Many of these assumptions cannot currently be\nwell justified. If regulation is to be based on evaluations, it should require\nthat AI development be halted if evaluations demonstrate unacceptable danger or\nif these assumptions are inadequately justified. Our presented approach aims to\nenhance transparency in AI development, offering a practical path towards more\neffective governance of advanced AI systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u9032\u6b65\uff0cAI \u8a55\u4f30\u6b63\u6210\u70ba\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cd5\u898f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u67f1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e3b\u5f35\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u6cd5\u898f\u61c9\u8981\u6c42\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u660e\u78ba\u8aaa\u660e\u4e26\u8b49\u660e\u8a55\u4f30\u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u8ad6\u8b49\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6211\u5011\u627e\u51fa AI \u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8a2d\uff08\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u73fe\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u672a\u4f86\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5a01\u8105\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5f15\u5c0e\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u8a31\u591a\u5047\u8a2d\u76ee\u524d\u7121\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u8b49\u5be6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6cd5\u898f\u8981\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u5c31\u61c9\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u8a55\u4f30\u8b49\u660e\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u5371\u96aa\u6216\u9019\u4e9b\u5047\u8a2d\u7121\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8b49\u5be6\u6642\uff0c\u505c\u6b62 AI \u958b\u767c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8 AI \u958b\u767c\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u70ba\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6cbb\u7406\u5148\u9032 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u689d\u5be6\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f91\u3002", "author": "Peter Barnett et.al.", "authors": "Peter Barnett, Lisa Thiergart", "id": "2411.12820v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12820v1", "repo": "null"}}

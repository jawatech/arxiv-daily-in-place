In this paper, we investigate this $\\textit{Ship of Language Models}$\nproblem, wherein scientific evolution takes the form of continuous, implicit\nretrofits of key existing terms. We seek to initiate a novel perspective of\nscientific progress, in addition to the more well-studied emergence of new\nterms. To this end, we construct the data infrastructure based on recent NLP\npublications. Then, we perform a series of text-based analyses toward a\ndetailed, quantitative understanding of the use of Language Models as a term of\nart. Our work highlights how systems and theories influence each other in\nscientific discourse, and we call for attention to the transformation of this\nShip that we all are contributing to.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u4e00\u8a5e\u4f5c\u70ba\u7279\u5b9a\u6642\u9593\u5c0d\u611f\u8208\u8da3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4e0d\u65b7\u5730\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u5176\u6240\u6307\u5c31\u50cf\u5fd2\u4fee\u65af\u4e4b\u8239\u4e00\u6a23\u66f4\u63db\u96f6\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u8cea\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u8258\u8239\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u9019\u500b\u300c\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u8239\u300d\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u79d1\u5b78\u6f14\u5316\u63a1\u53d6\u4e86\u5c0d\u95dc\u9375\u73fe\u6709\u8853\u8a9e\u6301\u7e8c\u3001\u96b1\u542b\u7684\u6539\u9020\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0b\u6c42\u958b\u555f\u4e00\u500b\u79d1\u5b78\u9032\u6b65\u7684\u65b0\u89c0\u9ede\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5c0d\u65b0\u8853\u8a9e\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u5916\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u6700\u8fd1\u7684 NLP \u51fa\u7248\u7269\u69cb\u5efa\u4e86\u6578\u64da\u57fa\u790e\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u6587\u672c\u9032\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u65bc\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a73\u7d30\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u70ba\u8853\u8a9e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u9ede\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7d71\u548c\u7406\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u79d1\u5b78\u8ad6\u8ff0\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6211\u5011\u547c\u7c72\u95dc\u6ce8\u6211\u5011\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u4fc3\u6210\u7684\u9019\u8258\u8239\u7684\u8f49\u8b8a\u3002", "author": "Shengqi Zhu et.al.", "authors": "Shengqi Zhu, Jeffrey M.

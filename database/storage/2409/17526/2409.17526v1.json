To\naddress these risks, this research proposes the development of a drone-based\npruning system equipped with specialized pruning tools and a stereo vision\ncamera, enabling precise detection and trimming of branches. Deep learning\nalgorithms, including YOLO and Mask R-CNN, are employed to ensure accurate\nbranch detection, while the Semi-Global Matching algorithm is integrated to\nprovide reliable distance estimation. The synergy between these techniques\nfacilitates the precise identification of branch locations and enables\nefficient, targeted pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined\nimplementation of YOLO and SGBM enables the drone to accurately detect branches\nand measure their distances from the drone. This research not only improves the\nsafety and efficiency of pruning operations but also makes a significant\ncontribution to the advancement of drone technology in the automation of\nagricultural and forestry practices, laying a foundational framework for\nfurther innovations in environmental management.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4eba\u5de5\u4fee\u526a\u8f3b\u5c04\u677e\u6a39\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u9577\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u958b\u767c\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u7684\u4fee\u526a\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u914d\u5099\u5c08\u7528\u4fee\u526a\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7acb\u9ad4\u8996\u89ba\u76f8\u6a5f\uff0c\u5be6\u73fe\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u6a39\u679d\u6aa2\u6e2c\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u3002\u63a1\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec YOLO \u548c Mask R-CNN\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u6a39\u679d\u6aa2\u6e2c\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u6574\u5408\u534a\u5168\u5c40\u5339\u914d\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u4f30\u8a08\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5354\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u7cbe\u78ba\u8b58\u5225\u6a39\u679d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e26\u5be6\u73fe\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u526a\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cYOLO \u548c SGBM \u7684\u7d50\u5408\u5be6\u4f5c\u4f7f\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u80fd\u5920\u6e96\u78ba\u6aa2\u6e2c\u6a39\u679d\u4e26\u6e2c\u91cf\u5b83\u5011\u8207\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u50c5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fee\u526a\u4f5c\u696d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8207\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5c0d\u8fb2\u696d\u548c\u6797\u696d\u5be6\u52d9\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u6280\u8853\u9032\u6b65\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u70ba\u74b0\u5883\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5275\u65b0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u790e\u67b6\u69cb\u3002", "author": "Yida Lin et.al.", "authors": "Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green", "id": "2409.17526v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17526v1", "repo": "null"}}

AI has further\npervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and\nresponse suggestions. As social media becomes young people's main method of\npeer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and\nassist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way.\nWe asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded\nhuman- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that\nparticipants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about\nrelationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a\nsensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human\nresponse. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange\nand its implications for supporting young people's well-being.

Recently, the security of these technologies has been demonstrated\nto be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically speaking, speech samples are\nattacked by noisy disruption and component modification in present triggers. We\nsuggest that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on emotion, a\nhigher-level subjective perceptual attribute inherent in speech. Furthermore,\nwe proposed that emotional voice conversion technology can serve as the speech\nbackdoor attack trigger, and the method is called EmoAttack. Based on this, we\nconducted attack experiments on two speech classification tasks, showcasing\nthat EmoAttack method owns impactful trigger effectiveness and its remarkable\nattack success rate and accuracy variance. Additionally, the ablation\nexperiments found that speech with intensive emotion is more suitable to be\ntargeted for attacks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u8a9e\u97f3\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u65bc\u8a9e\u97f3\u7684\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5df2\u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u8a9e\u97f3\u6a23\u672c\u6703\u53d7\u5230\u7576\u524d\u89f8\u767c\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u96dc\u8a0a\u5e72\u64fe\u548c\u5143\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u8b70\u8a9e\u97f3\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u60c5\u7dd2\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5167\u542b\u65bc\u8a9e\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u8f03\u9ad8\u5c64\u6b21\u4e3b\u89c0\u611f\u77e5\u5c6c\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u60c5\u7dd2\u5316\u8a9e\u97f3\u8f49\u63db\u6280\u8853\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5c\u8a9e\u97f3\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u89f8\u767c\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a31\u70ba EmoAttack\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u5169\u500b\u8a9e\u97f3\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u653b\u64ca\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 EmoAttack \u65b9\u6cd5\u64c1\u6709\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u89f8\u767c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u986f\u8457\u7684\u653b\u64ca\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5dee\u7570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5be6\u9a57\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5e36\u6709\u5f37\u70c8\u60c5\u7dd2\u7684\u8a9e\u97f3\u66f4\u9069\u5408\u6210\u70ba\u653b\u64ca\u76ee\u6a19\u3002", "author": "Wenhan Yao et.al.", "authors": "Wenhan Yao, Zedong XingXiarun Chen, Jia Liu, yongqiang He, Weiping Wen", "id": "2408.15508v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15508v1", "repo": "null"}}

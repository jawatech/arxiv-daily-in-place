Based on this taxonomy, we\nsynthesize a benchmark dataset, CertainlyUncertain, featuring 178K visual\nquestion answering (VQA) samples as contrastive pairs. This is achieved by 1)\ninpainting images to make previously answerable questions into unanswerable\nones; and 2) using image captions to prompt large language models for both\nanswerable and unanswerable questions. Additionally, we introduce a new metric\nconfidence-weighted accuracy, that is well correlated with both accuracy and\ncalibration error, to address the shortcomings of existing metrics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fa8\u8b58\u77e5\u8b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u771f\u6b63\u8aa0\u5be6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5148\u6c7a\u689d\u4ef6\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5c08\u9580\u91dd\u5c0d\u8996\u89ba\u8a9e\u8a00 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\uff0c\u5340\u5206\u8a8d\u8b58\u8ad6\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u6e90\u65bc\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u548c\u96a8\u6a5f\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u7531\u65bc\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9810\u6e2c\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4e26\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8a0e\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u7cbe\u7d30\u985e\u5225\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7d9c\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 CertainlyUncertain\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b 178K \u500b\u8996\u89ba\u554f\u7b54 (VQA) \u7bc4\u4f8b\u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u6bd4\u5c0d\u3002\u9019\u662f\u900f\u904e 1) \u4fee\u88dc\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5c07\u5148\u524d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u554f\u984c\u8b8a\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca 2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5f71\u50cf\u6a19\u984c\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u554f\u984c\u4f86\u5be6\u73fe\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u4fe1\u5fc3\u52a0\u6b0a\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b83\u8207\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u6821\u6e96\u8aa4\u5dee\u90fd\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u73fe\u6709\u6307\u6a19\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002", "author": "Khyathi Raghavi Chandu et.al.", "authors": "Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Linjie Li, Anas Awadalla, Ximing Lu, Jae Sung Park, Jack Hessel, Lijuan Wang, Yejin Choi", "id": "2407.01942v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01942v1", "repo": "null"}}

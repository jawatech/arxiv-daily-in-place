{"2406.04734": {"publish_time": "2024-06-07", "title": "Generative AI Models: Opportunities and Risks for Industry and Authorities", "paper_summary": "Generative AI models are capable of performing a wide range of tasks that\ntraditionally require creativity and human understanding. They learn patterns\nfrom existing data during training and can subsequently generate new content\nsuch as texts, images, and music that follow these patterns. Due to their\nversatility and generally high-quality results, they, on the one hand,\nrepresent an opportunity for digitalization. On the other hand, the use of\ngenerative AI models introduces novel IT security risks that need to be\nconsidered for a comprehensive analysis of the threat landscape in relation to\nIT security. In response to this risk potential, companies or authorities using\nthem should conduct an individual risk analysis before integrating generative\nAI into their workflows. The same applies to developers and operators, as many\nrisks in the context of generative AI have to be taken into account at the time\nof development or can only be influenced by the operating company. Based on\nthis, existing security measures can be adjusted, and additional measures can\nbe taken.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u57f7\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u4efb\u52d9\u50b3\u7d71\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u5275\u9020\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u985e\u7406\u89e3\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f9e\u73fe\u6709\u6578\u64da\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u96a8\u5f8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9075\u5faa\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6587\u672c\u3001\u5716\u50cf\u548c\u97f3\u6a02\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u6578\u4f4d\u5316\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684 IT \u5b89\u5168\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u616e\u9019\u4e9b\u98a8\u96aa\u624d\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u8207 IT \u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5a01\u8105\u74b0\u5883\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u7a2e\u98a8\u96aa\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u6216\u7576\u5c40\u61c9\u5728\u5c07\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u6574\u5408\u5230\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e4b\u524d\u9032\u884c\u500b\u5225\u98a8\u96aa\u5206\u6790\u3002\u958b\u767c\u4eba\u54e1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u54e1\u4e5f\u9069\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8a31\u591a\u98a8\u96aa\u5fc5\u9808\u5728\u958b\u767c\u6642\u8003\u616e\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u904b\u71df\u516c\u53f8\u4f86\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6b64\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8abf\u6574\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e26\u63a1\u53d6\u984d\u5916\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "author": "Tobias Alt et.al.", "authors": "Tobias Alt, Andrea Ibisch, Clemens Meiser, Anna Wilhelm, Raphael Zimmer, Christian Berghoff, Christoph Droste, Jens Karschau, Friederike Laus, Rainer Plaga, Carola Plesch, Britta Sennewald, Thomas Thaeren, Kristina Unverricht, Steffen Waurick", "id": "2406.04734v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04734v1", "repo": "null"}}

In this blogpost we'll take\na look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into\na frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover\nsome of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for\nadditional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation\nmeasures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works\non calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is\nmeant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their\nevaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that\nis still widely used to evaluate calibration.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8981\u88ab\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u9808\u7d93\u904e\u6821\u6e96\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5b83\u5728\u6bcf\u500b\u6c7a\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6e96\u78ba\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u771f\u5be6\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u90e8\u843d\u683c\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u63a2\u8a0e\u6821\u6e96\u6700\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u6e96\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6db5\u84cb\u6b64\u6307\u6a19\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9019\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9ede\u5982\u4f55\u6d6e\u73fe\u51fa\u5c0d\u6821\u6e96\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u65b0\u8a55\u4f30\u6307\u6a19\u3002\u9019\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u4e26\u975e\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8a0e\u6240\u6709\u95dc\u65bc\u6821\u6e96\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u5982\u4f55\u6821\u6e96\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u6eab\u548c\u5730\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u8a55\u4f30\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u91cd\u65b0\u5f37\u8abf\u4e00\u500b\u4ecd\u7136\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u6821\u6e96\u7684\u6307\u6a19\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Maja Pavlovic et.al.", "authors": "Maja Pavlovic", "id": "2501.19047v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19047v2", "repo": "null"}}

In medicine and\nhealthcare, there is a particular demand for sufficient and objective\nexplainability of the outcome generated by AI models. However, AI models are\ngenerally considered as black boxes due to their complexity, and the\ncomputational process leading to their response is often opaque. Although\nseveral methods have been proposed to explain the behavior of models by\nevaluating the importance of each feature in discrimination and prediction,\nthey may suffer from biases and opacities arising from the scale and sampling\nprotocol of the dataset used for training or testing. To overcome the\nshortcomings of existing methods, we explore an alternative approach to provide\nan objective explanation of AI models that can be defined independently of the\nlearning process and does not require additional data. As a preliminary study\nfor this direction of research, this work examines a numerical availability of\nthe Jacobian matrix of deep learning models that measures how stably a model\nresponses against small perturbations added to the input. The indicator, if\navailable, are calculated from a trained AI model for a given target input.\nThis is a first step towards a perturbation-based explanation, which will\nassist medical practitioners in understanding and interpreting the response of\nthe AI model in its clinical application.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u5df2\u9054\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u91ab\u7642\u88dd\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u914d\u5099\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u8a3a\u65b7\u652f\u63f4\u548c\u4f8b\u884c\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3002\u5728\u91ab\u5b78\u548c\u4fdd\u5065\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc AI \u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u6709\u8db3\u5920\u4e14\u5ba2\u89c0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u6709\u7279\u5225\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u9ed1\u76d2\u5b50\uff0c\u800c\u5c0e\u81f4\u5176\u53cd\u61c9\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u904e\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5df2\u7d93\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u91cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8a55\u4f30\u6bcf\u500b\u7279\u5fb5\u5728\u5224\u5225\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u53d7\u5230\u8a13\u7df4\u6216\u6e2c\u8a66\u6240\u7528\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u898f\u6a21\u548c\u62bd\u6a23\u5354\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u7a2e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ba2\u89c0\u89e3\u91cb\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7368\u7acb\u65bc\u5b78\u7fd2\u904e\u7a0b\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u984d\u5916\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u9019\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9663\u7684\u6578\u503c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u8861\u91cf\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u8f38\u5165\u4e2d\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u5c0f\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u53cd\u61c9\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u6a19\u6703\u5f9e\u8a13\u7df4\u597d\u7684 AI \u6a21\u578b\u8a08\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d6\u5f97\u7d66\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u8f38\u5165\u3002\u9019\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u64fe\u52d5\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u5354\u52a9\u91ab\u7642\u5f9e\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u8a6e\u91cb AI \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u81e8\u5e8a\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u61c9\u3002", "author": "Takeshi Abe et.al.", "authors": "Takeshi Abe, Yoshiyuki Asai", "id": "2502.14001v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14001v1", "repo": "null"}}

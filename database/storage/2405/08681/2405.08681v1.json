Existing bias mitigation methods often achieve\nhigh level of fairness at the cost of significant accuracy degradation. In\nresponse to this challenge, we propose an innovative and adaptable Soft Nearest\nNeighbor Loss-based channel pruning framework, which achieves fairness through\nchannel pruning. Traditionally, channel pruning is utilized to accelerate\nneural network inference. However, our work demonstrates that pruning can also\nbe a potent tool for achieving fairness. Our key insight is that different\nchannels in a layer contribute differently to the accuracy of different groups.\nBy selectively pruning critical channels that lead to the accuracy difference\nbetween the privileged and unprivileged groups, we can effectively improve\nfairness without sacrificing accuracy significantly. Experiments conducted on\ntwo skin lesion diagnosis datasets across multiple sensitive attributes\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art\ntrade-off between accuracy and fairness.

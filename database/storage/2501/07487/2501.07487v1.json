Sustainable AI is increasingly important given that training of\nand inference with AI models such as large langrage models are consuming a\nlarge amount of computing power. In this article, we discuss current issues,\nopportunities and example solutions for addressing these issues, and future\nchallenges to tackle, from the data and system perspectives, related to data\nacquisition, data processing, and AI model training and inference.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6c38\u7e8c AI \u662f AI \u7684\u5b50\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u95dc\u6ce8\u65bc\u958b\u767c\u548c\u4f7f\u7528 AI \u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e1b\u5c11\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff\u4e26\u9054\u6210\u6c38\u7e8c\u6027\u3002\u6c38\u7e8c AI \u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u8a13\u7df4\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49 AI \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9032\u884c\u63a8\u8ad6\u6703\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5f9e\u8cc7\u6599\u548c\u7cfb\u7d71\u89c0\u9ede\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u5728\u8cc7\u6599\u53d6\u5f97\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u8655\u7406\u3001AI \u6a21\u578b\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u63a8\u8ad6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u56e0\u61c9\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u7684\u73fe\u6cc1\u8b70\u984c\u3001\u6a5f\u6703\u548c\u7bc4\u4f8b\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u4f86\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Tao Xie et.al.", "authors": "Tao Xie, David Harel, Dezhi Ran, Zhenwen Li, Maoliang Li, Zhi Yang, Leye Wang, Xiang Chen, Ying Zhang, Wentao Zhang, Meng Li, Chen Zhang, Linyi Li, Assaf Marron", "id": "2501.07487v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07487v1", "repo": "null"}}

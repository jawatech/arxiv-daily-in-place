One of its main challenges is the evaluation and selection of\nembryo for implantation, a process with large inter- and intra-clinician\nvariability. Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their\nopaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where\ntransparency in the decision making is key. In this paper we analyze the\ncurrent work in the explainability of AI-assisted embryo analysis models,\nidentifying the limitations. We also discuss how these models could be\nintegrated in the clinical context as decision support systems, considering the\nneeds of clinicians and patients. Finally, we propose guidelines for the sake\nof increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, pushing this technology\nforward towards established clinical practice.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Lucia Urcelay et.al.", "authors": "Lucia Urcelay,Daniel Hinjos,Pablo A.

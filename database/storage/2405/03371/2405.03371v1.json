Existing explainable systems generate\nveracity justifications from investigative journalism, which suffer from\ndebunking delayed and low efficiency. Recent studies simply assume that the\njustification is equivalent to the majority opinions expressed in the wisdom of\ncrowds. However, the opinions typically contain some inaccurate or biased\ninformation since the wisdom of crowds is uncensored. To detect fake news from\na sea of diverse, crowded and even competing narratives, in this paper, we\npropose a novel defense-based explainable fake news detection framework.\nSpecifically, we first propose an evidence extraction module to split the\nwisdom of crowds into two competing parties and respectively detect salient\nevidences. To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a\nprompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate\njustifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally,\nwe propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling\nthe defense among these justifications. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of fake news detection and provides\nhigh-quality justifications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Bo Wang et.al.", "authors": "Bo Wang,Jing Ma,Hongzhan Lin,Zhiwei Yang,Ruichao Yang,Yuan Tian,Yi Chang", "id": "2405.03371v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03371v1", "repo": "null"}}

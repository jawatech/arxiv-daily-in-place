In\nthis work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that\ncan be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines\nagents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic\nframework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its\nadaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is\ninfluenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We\nshow with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet,\nbut that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper\nargues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al.\n(2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al.\n(2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner. We\nend the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an\nartificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u6fc0\u8d77\u4e86\u95dc\u65bc\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u65b9\u5f0f\u5be6\u73fe\u80fd\u52d5\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4e4b\u54f2\u5b78\u8faf\u8ad6\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u7406\u8ad6\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u70ba\u8faf\u8ad6\u505a\u51fa\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4f5c\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95be\u503c\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u5c07\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u76ee\u6a19\u59cb\u7d42\u53d7\u5230\u7531\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u5b58\u53d6\u6b77\u53f2\u3001\u5176\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u66f2\u76ee\u53ca\u5176\u5916\u90e8\u74b0\u5883\u7d44\u6210\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u56e0\u7d20\u6846\u67b6\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u53cd\u904e\u4f86\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u6846\u67b6\u53c8\u53d7\u5230\u4ee3\u7406\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u884c\u52d5\u548c\u5b83\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e6b\u52a9\u4e0b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 LLM \u9084\u4e0d\u662f\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u524d\u9032\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u5c07 Park \u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u69cb\u8207 Boiko \u7b49\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684 Coscientist \u7b49\u6a21\u7d44\u7d50\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u65b9\u5f0f\u5be6\u73fe\u80fd\u52d5\u6027\u3002(2023) \u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u65b9\u5f0f\u5be6\u73fe\u80fd\u52d5\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u53cd\u601d\u5728\u69cb\u5efa\u9019\u7a2e\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u6642\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u969c\u7919\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f86\u7d50\u675f\u672c\u6587\u3002", "author": "Maud Van Lier et.al.", "authors": "Maud Van Lier, Gorka Mu\u00f1oz-Gil", "id": "2407.16190v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16190v1", "repo": "null"}}

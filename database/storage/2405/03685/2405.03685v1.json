We extend MLLMs' perceptual\ncapabilities to ground and reason about images in 3-dimensional space. To that\nend, we first develop a large-scale pre-training dataset for 2D and 3D called\nLV3D by combining multiple existing 2D and 3D recognition datasets under a\ncommon task formulation: as multi-turn question-answering. Next, we introduce a\nnew MLLM named Cube-LLM and pre-train it on LV3D. We show that pure data\nscaling makes a strong 3D perception capability without 3D specific\narchitectural design or training objective. Cube-LLM exhibits intriguing\nproperties similar to LLMs: (1) Cube-LLM can apply chain-of-thought prompting\nto improve 3D understanding from 2D context information. (2) Cube-LLM can\nfollow complex and diverse instructions and adapt to versatile input and output\nformats. (3) Cube-LLM can be visually prompted such as 2D box or a set of\ncandidate 3D boxes from specialists. Our experiments on outdoor benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Cube-LLM significantly outperforms existing baselines by 21.3\npoints of AP-BEV on the Talk2Car dataset for 3D grounded reasoning and 17.7\npoints on the DriveLM dataset for complex reasoning about driving scenarios,\nrespectively. Cube-LLM also shows competitive results in general MLLM\nbenchmarks such as refCOCO for 2D grounding with (87.0) average score, as well\nas visual question answering benchmarks such as VQAv2, GQA, SQA, POPE, etc. for\ncomplex reasoning.

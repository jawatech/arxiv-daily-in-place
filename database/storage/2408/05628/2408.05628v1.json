The primary\nobjective of this research is to evaluate and compare the performance of\nvarious forecasting models, ranging from traditional machine learning models to\nmore complex neural networks, as well as the impact of different lengths of\ntraining periods. The performance metrics, mean absolute error, root mean\nsquare error, and relative mean absolute error, are utilized to assess and\ncompare the accuracy of each model. A comprehensive set of input features was\ninvestigated and selected from data recorded between October 2018 and September\n2022. The paper demonstrates that the daily EU Natural Gas price is a more\nuseful feature for electricity price forecasting in Ireland than the daily\nHenry Hub Natural Gas price. This study also shows that the correlation of\nfeatures to the day-ahead market price has changed in recent years. The price\nof natural gas on the day and the amount of wind energy on the grid that hour\nare significantly more important than any other features. More specifically\nspeaking, the input fuel for electricity has become a more important driver of\nthe price of it, than the total generation or demand. In addition, it can be\nseen that System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) is highly correlated with\nthe day-ahead market price, and that renewables are pushing down the price of\nelectricity.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u5c0d\u96fb\u529b\u50f9\u683c\u9810\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u95dc\u6ce8\u611b\u723e\u862d\u7d9c\u5408\u55ae\u4e00\u96fb\u529b\u5e02\u5834\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u8fd1\u671f\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52d5\u6642\u671f\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f03\u5404\u7a2e\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f9e\u50b3\u7d71\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u66f4\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u9577\u5ea6\u7684\u57f9\u8a13\u9031\u671f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6a19\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7d55\u5c0d\u8aa4\u5dee\u3001\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8aa4\u5dee\u548c\u76f8\u5c0d\u5e73\u5747\u7d55\u5c0d\u8aa4\u5dee\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f03\u6bcf\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u5f9e 2018 \u5e74 10 \u6708\u81f3 2022 \u5e74 9 \u6708\u671f\u9593\u8a18\u9304\u7684\u6578\u64da\u4e2d\u8abf\u67e5\u4e26\u9078\u64c7\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ea8\u5229\u6a1e\u7d10\u5929\u7136\u6c23\u50f9\u683c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u6b50\u76df\u5929\u7136\u6c23\u50f9\u683c\u662f\u611b\u723e\u862d\u96fb\u529b\u50f9\u683c\u9810\u6e2c\u66f4\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u9084\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7279\u5fb5\u8207\u9694\u591c\u5e02\u5834\u50f9\u683c\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u767c\u751f\u4e86\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u7576\u5929\u7684\u5929\u7136\u6c23\u50f9\u683c\u548c\u90a3\u4e00\u5c0f\u6642\u96fb\u7db2\u4e0a\u7684\u98a8\u80fd\u6bd4\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u5fb5\u90fd\u91cd\u8981\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u9ad4\u5730\u8aaa\uff0c\u96fb\u529b\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u71c3\u6599\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u5176\u50f9\u683c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9a45\u52d5\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7e3d\u767c\u96fb\u91cf\u6216\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u51fa\u7cfb\u7d71\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u6ef2\u900f (SNSP) \u8207\u9694\u591c\u5e02\u5834\u50f9\u683c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u95dc\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u52d5\u96fb\u529b\u50f9\u683c\u4e0b\u8dcc\u3002", "author": "Ben Harkin et.al.", "authors": "Ben Harkin, Xueqin Liu", "id": "2408.05628v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05628v1", "repo": "null"}}

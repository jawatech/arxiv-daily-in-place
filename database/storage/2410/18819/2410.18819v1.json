As language models advance at an\nunprecedented pace, a critical question arises: Are these models becoming\nself-conscious? Drawing upon insights from psychological and neural science,\nthis work presents a practical definition of self-consciousness for language\nmodels and refines ten core concepts. Our work pioneers an investigation into\nself-consciousness in language models by, for the first time, leveraging causal\nstructural games to establish the functional definitions of the ten core\nconcepts. Based on our definitions, we conduct a comprehensive four-stage\nexperiment: quantification (evaluation of ten leading models), representation\n(visualization of self-consciousness within the models), manipulation\n(modification of the models' representation), and acquisition (fine-tuning the\nmodels on core concepts). Our findings indicate that although models are in the\nearly stages of developing self-consciousness, there is a discernible\nrepresentation of certain concepts within their internal mechanisms. However,\nthese representations of self-consciousness are hard to manipulate positively\nat the current stage, yet they can be acquired through targeted fine-tuning.\nOur datasets and code are at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/SelfConsciousness.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\uff0c\u5c0d\u81ea\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u601d\u8003\u7684\u5167\u7701\uff0c\n\u4ee3\u8868\u8457\u4e00\u500b\u9ad8\u7d1a\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u554f\u984c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e86\uff1a\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u5728\u8b8a\u5f97\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\uff1f\u501f\u9452\u5fc3\u7406\u5b78\u548c\u795e\u7d93\u79d1\u5b78\u7684\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5be6\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u4e26\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u5341\u500b\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u904e\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u7d50\u69cb\u904a\u6232\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u5341\u500b\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u958b\u5275\u4e86\u5c0d\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u57fa\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56db\u968e\u6bb5\u5be6\u9a57\uff1a\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u8a55\u4f30\u5341\u500b\u9818\u5148\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3001\u8868\u5fb5\uff08\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\uff09\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u5fb5\uff09\u548c\u7fd2\u5f97\uff08\u5fae\u8abf\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8655\u65bc\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\u767c\u5c55\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5167\u90e8\u6a5f\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8457\u67d0\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u53ef\u8b58\u5225\u8868\u5fb5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8b58\u7684\u8868\u5fb5\u5728\u7576\u524d\u968e\u6bb5\u5f88\u96e3\u88ab\u7a4d\u6975\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u904e\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8abf\u4f86\u7372\u5f97\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u78bc\u5728 https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/SelfConsciousness\u3002", "author": "Sirui Chen et.al.", "authors": "Sirui Chen, Shu Yu, Shengjie Zhao, Chaochao Lu", "id": "2410.18819v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18819v1", "repo": "https://github.com/opencausalab/selfconsciousness"}}

Due to their ability to run on more accessible hardware and\npreserve user privacy, SLMs possess the potential to democratize access to\nlanguage models for individuals of different socioeconomic status and with\ndifferent privacy preferences. This study assesses several state-of-the-art\nSLMs (e.g., Apple's OpenELM, Microsoft's Phi, Google's Gemma, and the Tinyllama\nproject) for use in the financial domain to support the development of\nfinancial literacy LMs. Democratizing access to quality financial information\nfor those who are financially under educated is greatly needed in society,\nparticularly as new financial markets and products emerge and participation in\nfinancial markets increases due to ease of access. We are the first to examine\nthe use of open-source SLMs to democratize access to financial question\nanswering capabilities for individuals and students. To this end, we provide an\nanalysis of the memory usage, inference time, similarity comparisons to\nground-truth answers, and output readability of prominent SLMs to determine\nwhich models are most accessible and capable of supporting access to financial\ninformation. We analyze zero-shot and few-shot learning variants of the models.\nThe results suggest that some off-the-shelf SLMs merit further exploration and\nfine-tuning to prepare them for individual use, while others may have limits to\ntheir democratization.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (SLM) \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u53c3\u6578\u5c11\u65bc 30 \u5104\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6b63\u65bc\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u548c\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7531\u65bc SLM \u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u6613\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u786c\u9ad4\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\u4e26\u4fdd\u8b77\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u96b1\u79c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 SLM \u5177\u6709\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6b0a\uff0c\u8b93\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u6703\u7d93\u6fdf\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u96b1\u79c1\u504f\u597d\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u90fd\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8a55\u4f30\u4e86\u6578\u500b\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 SLM\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 Apple \u7684 OpenELM\u3001Microsoft \u7684 Phi\u3001Google \u7684 Gemma \u548c Tinyllama \u5c08\u6848\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7528\u65bc\u91d1\u878d\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u63f4\u91d1\u878d\u7d20\u990a LM \u7684\u958b\u767c\u3002\u793e\u6703\u6975\u9700\u8981\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u5c0d\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u8ca1\u52d9\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7684\u53d6\u5f97\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u96a8\u8457\u65b0\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u5834\u548c\u7522\u54c1\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u65bc\u6613\u65bc\u53d6\u5f97\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u5c0d\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u5834\u7684\u53c3\u8207\u3002\u6211\u5011\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u63a2\u8a0e\u4f7f\u7528\u958b\u6e90 SLM\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u5c0d\u500b\u4eba\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d6\u5f97\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8a18\u61b6\u9ad4\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3001\u63a8\u8ad6\u6642\u9593\u3001\u8207\u6b63\u78ba\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5091\u51fa SLM \u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u53ef\u8b80\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5bb9\u6613\u53d6\u5f97\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u652f\u63f4\u53d6\u5f97\u8ca1\u52d9\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5c11\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u8b8a\u9ad4\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u73fe\u6210\u7684 SLM \u503c\u5f97\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8a0e\u548c\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e96\u5099\u500b\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6 SLM \u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5176\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u9650\u5236\u3002", "author": "Tagore Rao Kosireddy et.al.", "authors": "Tagore Rao Kosireddy, Jeffrey D.

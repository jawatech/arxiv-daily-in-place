This paper investigates the impact of UID principles on syntactic\nreduction, specifically focusing on the optional omission of the connector\n\"that\" in English subordinate clauses. Building upon previous research, we\nextend our investigation to a larger corpus of written English, utilize\ncontemporary large language models (LLMs) and extend the information-uniformity\nprinciples by the notion of entropy, to estimate the UID manifestations in the\nusecase of syntactic reduction choices.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5747\u52fb\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5bc6\u5ea6 (UID) \u5047\u8a2d\u4e3b\u5f35\uff0c\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u900f\u904e\u907f\u514d\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5cf0\u503c\u4f86\u512a\u5316\u5176\u8a71\u8a9e\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u96a8\u8457\u6642\u9593\u7dad\u6301\u76f8\u5c0d\u5747\u52fb\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u8f2a\u5ed3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e UID \u539f\u5247\u5c0d\u53e5\u6cd5\u7c21\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u95dc\u6ce8\u82f1\u8a9e\u5f9e\u5c6c\u5b50\u53e5\u4e2d\u9023\u63a5\u8a5e\u300cthat\u300d\u7684\u7701\u7565\u3002\u5728\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u790e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u7814\u7a76\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u82f1\u8a9e\u66f8\u9762\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7576\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u71b5\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64f4\u5c55\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5747\u52fb\u6027\u539f\u5247\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8a08 UID \u5728\u53e5\u6cd5\u7c21\u5316\u9078\u64c7\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002", "author": "Ella Rabinovich et.al.", "authors": "Ella Rabinovich", "id": "2405.20833v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20833v1", "repo": "null"}}

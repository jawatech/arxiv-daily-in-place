{"2406.07909": {"publish_time": "2024-06-12", "title": "Guiding Frame-Level CTC Alignments Using Self-knowledge Distillation", "paper_summary": "Transformer encoder with connectionist temporal classification (CTC)\nframework is widely used for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However,\nknowledge distillation (KD) for ASR displays a problem of disagreement between\nteacher-student models in frame-level alignment which ultimately hinders it\nfrom improving the student model's performance. In order to resolve this\nproblem, this paper introduces a self-knowledge distillation (SKD) method that\nguides the frame-level alignment during the training time. In contrast to the\nconventional method using separate teacher and student models, this study\nintroduces a simple and effective method sharing encoder layers and applying\nthe sub-model as the student model. Overall, our approach is effective in\nimproving both the resource efficiency as well as performance. We also\nconducted an experimental analysis of the spike timings to illustrate that the\nproposed method improves performance by reducing the alignment disagreement.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u9023\u63a5\u4e3b\u7fa9\u6642\u5e8f\u5206\u985e (CTC) \u6846\u67b6\u7684 Transformer \u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7528\u65bc\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58 (ASR)\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cASR \u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e (KD) \u5728\u6846\u67b6\u5c64\u7d1a\u5c0d\u9f4a\u4e0a\u6703\u51fa\u73fe\u5e2b\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u9593\u610f\u898b\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6700\u7d42\u963b\u7919\u4e86\u5b83\u63d0\u5347\u5b78\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u81ea\u6211\u77e5\u8b58\u84b8\u993e (SKD) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u5f15\u5c0e\u6846\u67b6\u5c64\u7d1a\u5c0d\u9f4a\u3002\u8207\u4f7f\u7528\u7368\u7acb\u5e2b\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7c21\u55ae\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u7de8\u78bc\u5668\u5c64\u4e26\u5c07\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u61c9\u7528\u70ba\u5b78\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8cc7\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5c16\u5cf0\u6642\u5e8f\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u8aaa\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u900f\u904e\u6e1b\u5c11\u5c0d\u9f4a\u5206\u6b67\u4f86\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "author": "Eungbeom Kim et.al.", "authors": "Eungbeom Kim, Hantae Kim, Kyogu Lee", "id": "2406.07909v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07909v1", "repo": "null"}}

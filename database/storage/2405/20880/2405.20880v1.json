The use of such autonomous learning agents\nhas become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact\nof players incorporating monetary transfers into their agents' algorithms,\naiming to incentivize behavior in their favor. Our focus is on understanding\nwhen players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how these\npayments affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare\nand its distribution among the players. We propose a simple game-theoretic\nmodel to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a\nbroad class of games, players benefit from letting their learning agents make\npayments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases,\nthis kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first-\nand second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy\ngame,'' the agents' dynamics can reach strong collusive outcomes with low\nrevenue for the auctioneer. These results highlight a challenge for mechanism\ndesign in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting\nwith their peers outside the boundaries of the mechanism.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u91cd\u8907\u7684\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u62cd\u8ce3\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f86\u9078\u64c7\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u884c\u52d5\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5df2\u5728\u7dda\u4e0a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5ee3\u6cdb\u6d41\u50b3\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u73a9\u5bb6\u5c07\u91d1\u9322\u8f49\u79fb\u7d0d\u5165\u5176\u4ee3\u7406\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u6fc0\u52f5\u6709\u5229\u65bc\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f55\u6642\u6709\u8a98\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u9322\u8f49\u79fb\u3001\u9019\u4e9b\u4ed8\u6b3e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u5b78\u7fd2\u52d5\u614b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u798f\u5229\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8ad6\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u6355\u6349\u9019\u7a2e\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4e00\u822c\u904a\u6232\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u904a\u6232\u985e\u5225\u4e2d\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53d7\u76ca\u65bc\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u904a\u6232\u52d5\u614b\u671f\u9593\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u8a31\u591a\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u884c\u70ba\u6703\u6539\u5584\u6240\u6709\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u798f\u5229\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4e00\u968e\u548c\u4e8c\u968e\u62cd\u8ce3\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u300c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u653f\u7b56\u535a\u5f08\u300d\u7684\u5747\u8861\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9054\u5230\u5c0d\u62cd\u8ce3\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5f37\u6709\u529b\u5171\u8b00\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u7d50\u679c\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d7\u76ca\u65bc\u5728\u6a5f\u5236\u754c\u7dda\u5916\u8207\u540c\u5115\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u6a5f\u5236\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Yoav Kolumbus et.al.", "authors": "Yoav Kolumbus, Joe Halpern, \u00c9va Tardos", "id": "2405.20880v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880v1", "repo": "null"}}

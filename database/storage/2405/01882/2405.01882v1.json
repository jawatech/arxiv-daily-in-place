It can detect dangerous occurrences, such as falls,\nand provide timely alerts to save lives. Non-invasive millimeter wave (mmWave)\nradar-based healthcare monitoring systems using advanced human activity\nrecognition (HAR) models have recently gained significant attention. However,\nthey encounter challenges in handling sparse point clouds, achieving real-time\ncontinuous classification, and coping with limited monitoring ranges when\nstatically mounted. To overcome these limitations, we propose RobHAR, a movable\nrobot-mounted mmWave radar system with lightweight deep neural networks for\nreal-time monitoring of human activities. Specifically, we first propose a\nsparse point cloud-based global embedding to learn the features of point clouds\nusing the light-PointNet (LPN) backbone. Then, we learn the temporal pattern\nwith a bidirectional lightweight LSTM model (BiLiLSTM). In addition, we\nimplement a transition optimization strategy, integrating the Hidden Markov\nModel (HMM) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to improve the\naccuracy and robustness of the continuous HAR. Our experiments on three\ndatasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the previous\nstudies in both discrete and continuous HAR tasks. Finally, we deploy our\nsystem on a movable robot-mounted edge computing platform, achieving flexible\nhealthcare monitoring in real-world scenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Zhanzhong Gu et.al.", "authors": "Zhanzhong Gu,Xiangjian He,Gengfa Fang,Chengpei Xu,Feng Xia,Wenjing Jia", "id": "2405.01882v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01882v1", "repo": "null"}}

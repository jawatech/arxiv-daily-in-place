This tutorial provides practical guidance to address\ncommon challenges in applying machine learning and deep learning methods for\nmental health detection on these platforms. It focuses on strategies for\nworking with diverse datasets, improving text preprocessing, and addressing\nissues such as imbalanced data and model evaluation. Real-world examples and\nstep-by-step instructions demonstrate how to apply these techniques\neffectively, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and ethical\nconsiderations. By sharing these approaches, this tutorial aims to help\nresearchers build more reliable and widely applicable models for mental health\nresearch, contributing to better tools for early detection and intervention.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u793e\u7fa4\u5a92\u9ad4\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f86\u6e90\uff0c\n\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f9e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u767c\u5e03\u7684\u8cbc\u6587\u4e2d\u5075\u6e2c\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u7b49\u72c0\u6cc1\u3002\n\u672c\u6559\u5b78\u63d0\u4f9b\u5be6\u52d9\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u5982\u4f55\u8655\u7406\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5075\u6e2c\u6642\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\n\u5b83\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u8655\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3001\u6539\u5584\u6587\u5b57\u524d\u8655\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8655\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8cc7\u6599\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8a55\u4f30\u7b49\u554f\u984c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\n\u5be6\u969b\u7bc4\u4f8b\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u8aaa\u660e\u793a\u7bc4\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u61c9\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u8907\u88fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u502b\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002\n\u900f\u904e\u5206\u4eab\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6559\u5b78\u6307\u5357\u65e8\u5728\u5354\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5efa\u69cb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5ee3\u6cdb\u9069\u7528\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\n\u9032\u800c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u65e9\u671f\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u4ecb\u5165\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "author": "Yeyubei Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yeyubei Zhang, Zhongyan Wang, Zhanyi Ding, Yexin Tian, Jianglai Dai, Xiaorui Shen, Yunchong Liu, Yuchen Cao", "id": "2502.04342v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04342v1", "repo": "null"}}

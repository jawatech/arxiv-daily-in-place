{"2409.07321": {"publish_time": "2024-09-11", "title": "Module-wise Adaptive Adversarial Training for End-to-end Autonomous Driving", "paper_summary": "Recent advances in deep learning have markedly improved autonomous driving\n(AD) models, particularly end-to-end systems that integrate perception,\nprediction, and planning stages, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\nHowever, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where\nhuman-imperceptible perturbations can disrupt decision-making processes. While\nadversarial training is an effective method for enhancing model robustness\nagainst such attacks, no prior studies have focused on its application to\nend-to-end AD models. In this paper, we take the first step in adversarial\ntraining for end-to-end AD models and present a novel Module-wise Adaptive\nAdversarial Training (MA2T). However, extending conventional adversarial\ntraining to this context is highly non-trivial, as different stages within the\nmodel have distinct objectives and are strongly interconnected. To address\nthese challenges, MA2T first introduces Module-wise Noise Injection, which\ninjects noise before the input of different modules, targeting training models\nwith the guidance of overall objectives rather than each independent module\nloss. Additionally, we introduce Dynamic Weight Accumulation Adaptation, which\nincorporates accumulated weight changes to adaptively learn and adjust the loss\nweights of each module based on their contributions (accumulated reduction\nrates) for better balance and robust training. To demonstrate the efficacy of\nour defense, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used nuScenes\ndataset across several end-to-end AD models under both white-box and black-box\nattacks, where our method outperforms other baselines by large margins\n(+5-10%). Moreover, we validate the robustness of our defense through\nclosed-loop evaluation in the CARLA simulation environment, showing improved\nresilience even against natural corruption.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\u986f\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u81ea\u52d5\u99d5\u99db (AD) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u6574\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9810\u6e2c\u548c\u898f\u5283\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4eba\u985e\u7121\u6cd5\u5bdf\u89ba\u7684\u64fe\u52d5\u6703\u7834\u58de\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u8a13\u7df4\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u589e\u5f37\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u6297\u6b64\u985e\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6c92\u6709\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5c07\u5176\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7aef\u5230\u7aef AD \u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u53d6\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef AD \u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u6a21\u7d44\u5316\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u8a13\u7df4 (MA2T)\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c07\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u8a13\u7df4\u64f4\u5c55\u5230\u9019\u500b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u968e\u6bb5\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7dca\u5bc6\u76f8\u9023\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\uff0cMA2T \u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6a21\u7d44\u5316\u96dc\u8a0a\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u4e4b\u524d\u6ce8\u5165\u96dc\u8a0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6574\u9ad4\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6bcf\u500b\u7368\u7acb\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u640d\u5931\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52d5\u614b\u6b0a\u91cd\u7d2f\u7a4d\u9069\u61c9\uff0c\u5b83\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u7d2f\u7a4d\u7684\u6b0a\u91cd\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u5176\u8ca2\u737b\uff08\u7d2f\u7a4d\u7684\u6e1b\u5c11\u7387\uff09\u81ea\u9069\u61c9\u5730\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u8abf\u6574\u6bcf\u500b\u6a21\u7d44\u7684\u640d\u5931\u6b0a\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7372\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u9632\u79a6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 nuScenes \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c0d\u591a\u500b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef AD \u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u64ca\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\uff08+5-10%\uff09\u512a\u65bc\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7dda\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5728 CARLA \u6a21\u64ec\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u9032\u884c\u9589\u74b0\u8a55\u4f30\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u9632\u79a6\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5c0d\u81ea\u7136\u7834\u58de\uff0c\u4e5f\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u6539\u9032\u7684\u5fa9\u539f\u529b\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Tianyuan Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Tianyuan Zhang, Lu Wang, Jiaqi Kang, Xinwei Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Yuwei Chen, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu", "id": "2409.07321v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07321v1", "repo": "null"}}

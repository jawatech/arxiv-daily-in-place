Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can\nbe used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of\nknowledge is also crucial in the design of intelligent robotic systems with\ncommon sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward\nand inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved\nin two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step, we investigate feature attribution\nmethods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level\ncausal effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related\nto both the arm joints and the environment features. This type of analysis\nprovides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state\nrepresentations, as well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the\nexplainability of causal effects at higher levels.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u56e0\u679c\u5b78\u7fd2\u8b93\u4eba\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u9810\u6e2c\u5176\u884c\u70ba\u5c0d\u5df2\u77e5\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e26\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u898f\u5283\u57f7\u884c\u66f4\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u77e5\u8b58\u4e5f\u6355\u6349\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u53ef\u4f9b\u5176\u5206\u6790\u548c\u884c\u70ba\u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5728\u5177\u5099\u5e38\u8b58\u7684\u667a\u6167\u578b\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7d71\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e2d\u4e5f\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5b78\u7fd2\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u64ec\u6a5f\u5668\u624b\u81c2\u53c3\u8207\u5169\u9805\u611f\u6e2c\u904b\u52d5\u4efb\u52d9\u6240\u7522\u751f\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5c6c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8207\u624b\u81c2\u95dc\u7bc0\u548c\u74b0\u5883\u7279\u5fb5\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u72c0\u614b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u500b\u5225\u7279\u5fb5\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u4f4e\u968e\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u61c9\u3002\u6b64\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u70ba\u72c0\u614b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7dad\u5ea6\u7e2e\u6e1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5805\u5be6\u7684\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c64\u7d1a\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u61c9\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u5f59\u6574\u77e5\u8b58\u3002", "author": "Miroslav Cibula et.al.", "authors": "Miroslav Cibula, Matthias Kerzel, Igor Farka\u0161", "id": "2410.07751v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07751v1", "repo": "null"}}

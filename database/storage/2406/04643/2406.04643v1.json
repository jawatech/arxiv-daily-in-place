{"2406.04643": {"publish_time": "2024-06-07", "title": "More Victories, Less Cooperation: Assessing Cicero's Diplomacy Play", "paper_summary": "The boardgame Diplomacy is a challenging setting for communicative and\ncooperative artificial intelligence. The most prominent communicative Diplomacy\nAI, Cicero, has excellent strategic abilities, exceeding human players.\nHowever, the best Diplomacy players master communication, not just tactics,\nwhich is why the game has received attention as an AI challenge. This work\nseeks to understand the degree to which Cicero succeeds at communication.\nFirst, we annotate in-game communication with abstract meaning representation\nto separate in-game tactics from general language. Second, we run two dozen\ngames with humans and Cicero, totaling over 200 human-player hours of\ncompetition. While AI can consistently outplay human players, AI-Human\ncommunication is still limited because of AI's difficulty with deception and\npersuasion. This shows that Cicero relies on strategy and has not yet reached\nthe full promise of communicative and cooperative AI.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u684c\u904a Diplomacy \u662f\u6e9d\u901a\u8207\u5408\u4f5c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u6311\u6230\u6027\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3002\u6700\u8457\u540d\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u578b Diplomacy AI\uff0cCicero\uff0c\u64c1\u6709\u7d55\u4f73\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u985e\u73a9\u5bb6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u7684 Diplomacy \u73a9\u5bb6\u7cbe\u901a\u6e9d\u901a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u50c5\u662f\u6230\u8853\uff0c\u9019\u4e5f\u662f\u904a\u6232\u4f5c\u70ba AI \u6311\u6230\u53d7\u5230\u95dc\u6ce8\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3 Cicero \u5728\u6e9d\u901a\u65b9\u9762\u6210\u529f\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u610f\u7fa9\u8868\u5fb5\u70ba\u904a\u6232\u5167\u6e9d\u901a\u52a0\u4e0a\u8a3b\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c07\u904a\u6232\u5167\u6230\u8853\u8207\u4e00\u822c\u8a9e\u8a00\u5340\u5206\u958b\u4f86\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u548c Cicero \u9032\u884c\u4e86 20 \u591a\u5834\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u7e3d\u8a08\u8d85\u904e 200 \u5c0f\u6642\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u73a9\u5bb6\u7af6\u8cfd\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 AI \u80fd\u5920\u6301\u7e8c\u52dd\u904e\u4eba\u985e\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc AI \u96e3\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u6b3a\u9a19\u548c\u8aaa\u670d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 AI \u8207\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9019\u986f\u793a Cicero \u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u9054\u5230\u6e9d\u901a\u8207\u5408\u4f5c AI \u7684\u5168\u90e8\u627f\u8afe\u3002", "author": "Wichayaporn Wongkamjan et.al.", "authors": "Wichayaporn Wongkamjan, Feng Gu, Yanze Wang, Ulf Hermjakob, Jonathan May, Brandon M.

In clinical practice, images are acquired\nfrom two different angles, and radiologists can fully utilize information from\nboth views, simultaneously locating the same lesion. However, for automatic\ndetection approaches such information fusion remains a challenge. In this\npaper, we propose a new model called MAMM-Net, which allows the processing of\nboth mammography views simultaneously by sharing information not only on an\nobject level, as seen in existing works, but also on a feature level.\nMAMM-Net's key component is the Fusion Layer, based on deformable attention and\ndesigned to increase detection precision while keeping high recall. Our\nexperiments show superior performance on the public DDSM dataset compared to\nthe previous state-of-the-art model, while introducing new helpful features\nsuch as lesion annotation on pixel-level and classification of lesions\nmalignancy.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Arina Varlamova et.al.", "authors": "Arina Varlamova,Valery Belotsky,Grigory Novikov,Anton Konushin,Evgeny Sidorov", "id": "2404.16718v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16718v1", "repo": "null"}}

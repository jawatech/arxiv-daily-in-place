Despite being in its nascent stages,\nthis emerging field grapples with nebulous concepts and intricate knowledge\nframeworks. By analyzing three prevailing concepts - explainable AI,\ntrustworthy AI, and ethical AI, this study defined responsible AI and\nidentified its core principles. Methodologically, this study successfully\ndemonstrated the implementation of leveraging AI's capabilities into\nbibliometrics for enhanced knowledge discovery and the cross-validation of\nexperimentally examined models with domain insights. Empirically, this study\ninvestigated 17,799 research articles contributed by the AI community since\n2015. This involves recognizing key technological players and their\nrelationships, unveiling the topical landscape and hierarchy of responsible AI,\ncharting its evolution, and elucidating the interplay between the\nresponsibility principles and primary AI techniques. An analysis of a core\ncohort comprising 380 articles from multiple disciplines captures the most\nrecent advancements in responsible AI. As one of the pioneering bibliometric\nstudies dedicated to exploring responsible AI, this study will provide\ncomprehensive macro-level insights, enhancing the understanding of responsible\nAI while furnishing valuable knowledge support for AI regulation and governance\ninitiatives.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Yi Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Yi Zhang,Mengjia Wu,Guangquan Zhang,Jie Lu", "id": "2405.02846v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02846v1", "repo": "null"}}

Without\nadditional information LLMs can generate lower quality responses due to lacking\nrelevant content and hallucinations, as well as the perception of poor\nemotional capability, and an inability to maintain a consistent character.\nKnowledge graphs are commonly used forms of external knowledge and may provide\nsolutions to these challenges. This paper introduces three proposals, utilizing\nknowledge graphs to enhance LLM generation. Firstly, dynamic knowledge graph\nembeddings and recommendation could allow for the integration of new\ninformation and the selection of relevant knowledge for response generation.\nSecondly, storing entities with emotional values as additional features may\nprovide knowledge that is better emotionally aligned with the user input.\nThirdly, integrating character information through narrative bubbles would\nmaintain character consistency, as well as introducing a structure that would\nreadily incorporate new information.", "paper_summary_zh": "LLM \u7d93\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5c0d\u8a71\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6c92\u6709\n\u984d\u5916\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0cLLM \u6703\u7522\u751f\u54c1\u8cea\u8f03\u4f4e\u7684\u56de\u61c9\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u7f3a\u4e4f\n\u76f8\u95dc\u5167\u5bb9\u548c\u5e7b\u89ba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0d\u60c5\u7dd2\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7121\u6cd5\u7dad\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\n\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u65bc\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\n\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e09\u9805\u5efa\u8b70\uff0c\u5229\u7528\n\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4f86\u589e\u5f37 LLM \u751f\u6210\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u52d5\u614b\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\n\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5efa\u8b70\u53ef\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u7684\n\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4e26\u9078\u64c7\u76f8\u95dc\u77e5\u8b58\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u56de\u61c9\u3002\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5c07\u5177\u6709\u60c5\u7dd2\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u5132\u5b58\u70ba\u984d\u5916\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\n\u63d0\u4f9b\u8207\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u8f38\u5165\u5728\u60c5\u7dd2\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\n\u7b2c\u4e09\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u6558\u4e8b\u6c23\u6ce1\u6574\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6703\n\u7dad\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\n\u8f15\u9b06\u7d0d\u5165\u65b0\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002", "author": "Alex Clay et.al.", "authors": "Alex Clay, Ernesto Jim\u00e9nez-Ruiz", "id": "2410.16196v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16196v1", "repo": "null"}}

This is a key\nrequirement for modern machine learning in which the goodness of a system is\nmeasured in terms of trustworthiness, clearly dividing what is safe from what\nis unsafe. The spirit of this paper is exactly in this direction. First, we\nintroduce a formal definition of {\\epsilon}-Safe Decision Region, a subset of\nthe input space in which the prediction of a target (safe) class is\nprobabilistically guaranteed. Second, we prove that, when data come from\nexponential family distributions, the form of such a region is analytically\ndetermined and controllable by design parameters, i.e. the probability of\nsampling the target class and the confidence on the prediction. However, the\nrequest of having exponential data is not always possible. Inspired by this\nlimitation, we developed Multi Cost SVM, an SVM based algorithm that\napproximates the safe region and is also able to handle unbalanced data. The\nresearch is complemented by experiments and code available for reproducibility.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u5206\u985e\u5668\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a5f\u7387\u4fdd\u8b49\u5c0d\u65bc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u53ef\u88ab\u8a8d\u70ba\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u9019\u662f\u73fe\u4ee3\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u4e00\u9805\u95dc\u9375\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u512a\u52a3\u662f\u6839\u64da\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u7684\uff0c\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u5c07\u5b89\u5168\u8207\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5340\u5206\u958b\u4f86\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u6b63\u662f\u671d\u9019\u500b\u65b9\u5411\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165{\\epsilon}-\u5b89\u5168\u6c7a\u7b56\u5340\u57df\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u8f38\u5165\u7a7a\u9593\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u76ee\u6a19\uff08\u5b89\u5168\uff09\u985e\u5225\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u5728\u6a5f\u7387\u4e0a\u662f\u6709\u4fdd\u8b49\u7684\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u7576\u8cc7\u6599\u4f86\u81ea\u6307\u6578\u65cf\u5206\u4f48\u6642\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u5340\u57df\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u662f\u7531\u8a2d\u8a08\u53c3\u6578\u89e3\u6790\u78ba\u5b9a\u7684\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u62bd\u6a23\u76ee\u6a19\u985e\u5225\u7684\u6a5f\u7387\u548c\u9810\u6e2c\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u64c1\u6709\u6307\u6578\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u4e26\u4e0d\u7e3d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u9019\u500b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u555f\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u591a\u6210\u672c SVM\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u57fa\u65bc SVM \u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b89\u5168\u5340\u57df\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u4e5f\u80fd\u5920\u8655\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u5be6\u9a57\u548c\u53ef\u4f9b\u91cd\u73fe\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\u78bc\u88dc\u5145\u3002", "author": "Alberto Carlevaro et.al.", "authors": "Alberto Carlevaro, Teodoro Alamo, Fabrizio Dabbene, Maurizio Mongelli", "id": "2501.17731v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17731v1", "repo": "null"}}

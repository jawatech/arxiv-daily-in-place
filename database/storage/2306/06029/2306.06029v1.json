To work well it requires, among\nother factors: selecting a proper level of generality/specificity of the\nexplanation; considering assumptions about the familiarity of the explanation\nbeneficiary with the AI task under consideration; referring to specific\nelements that have contributed to the decision; making use of additional\nknowledge (e.g. expert evidence) which might not be part of the prediction\nprocess; and providing evidence supporting negative hypothesis. Finally, the\nsystem needs to formulate the explanation in a clearly interpretable, and\npossibly convincing, way. Given these considerations, ANTIDOTE fosters an\nintegrated vision of explainable AI, where low-level characteristics of the\ndeep learning process are combined with higher level schemes proper of the\nhuman argumentation capacity. ANTIDOTE will exploit cross-disciplinary\ncompetences in deep learning and argumentation to support a broader and\ninnovative view of explainable AI, where the need for high-quality explanations\nfor clinical cases deliberation is critical. As a first result of the project,\nwe publish the Antidote CasiMedicos dataset to facilitate research on\nexplainable AI in general, and argumentation in the medical domain in\nparticular.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Rodrigo Agerri et.al.", "authors": "Rodrigo Agerri,I\u00f1igo Alonso,Aitziber Atutxa,Ander Berrondo,Ainara Estarrona,Iker Garcia-Ferrero,Iakes Goenaga,Koldo Gojenola,Maite Oronoz,Igor Perez-Tejedor,German Rigau,Anar Yeginbergenova", "id": "2306.06029v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06029v1", "repo": "null"}}

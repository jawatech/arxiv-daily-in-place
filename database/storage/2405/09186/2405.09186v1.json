{"2405.09186": {"publish_time": "2024-05-15", "title": "HumanRankEval: Automatic Evaluation of LMs as Conversational Assistants", "paper_summary": "Language models (LMs) as conversational assistants recently became popular\ntools that help people accomplish a variety of tasks. These typically result\nfrom adapting LMs pretrained on general domain text sequences through further\ninstruction-tuning and possibly preference optimisation methods. The evaluation\nof such LMs would ideally be performed using human judgement, however, this is\nnot scalable. On the other hand, automatic evaluation featuring auxiliary LMs\nas judges and/or knowledge-based tasks is scalable but struggles with assessing\nconversational ability and adherence to instructions. To help accelerate the\ndevelopment of LMs as conversational assistants, we propose a novel automatic\nevaluation task: HumanRankEval (HRE). It consists of a large-scale, diverse and\nhigh-quality set of questions, each with several answers authored and scored by\nhumans. To perform evaluation, HRE ranks these answers based on their\nlog-likelihood under the LM's distribution, and subsequently calculates their\ncorrelation with the corresponding human rankings. We support HRE's efficacy by\ninvestigating how efficiently it separates pretrained and instruction-tuned LMs\nof various sizes. We show that HRE correlates well with human judgements and is\nparticularly responsive to model changes following instruction-tuning.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LM) \u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u8a71\u52a9\u7406\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u71b1\u9580\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5e6b\u52a9\u4eba\u5011\u5b8c\u6210\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u900f\u904e\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8abf\u6574\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f86\u8abf\u6574\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u7db2\u57df\u6587\u5b57\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 LM \u800c\u7522\u751f\u7684\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b64\u985e LM \u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u61c9\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u985e\u5224\u65b7\u4f86\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u7121\u6cd5\u64f4\u5c55\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f14\u52a9 LM \u4f5c\u70ba\u8a55\u5be9\u548c/\u6216\u57fa\u65bc\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u70ba\u7279\u8272\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u8a55\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u64f4\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u96e3\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30\u5c0d\u8a71\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c0d\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u5e6b\u52a9\u52a0\u901f LM \u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u8a71\u52a9\u7406\u7684\u958b\u767c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u8a55\u4f30\u4efb\u52d9\uff1aHumanRankEval (HRE)\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u7d44\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u554f\u984c\u90fd\u6709\u5e7e\u500b\u4eba\u985e\u64b0\u5beb\u548c\u8a55\u5206\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u57f7\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0cHRE \u6703\u6839\u64da LM \u5206\u914d\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0d\u6578\u4f3c\u7136\u5ea6\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u7b54\u6848\u9032\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u8a08\u7b97\u5b83\u5011\u8207\u5c0d\u61c9\u4eba\u985e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u8abf\u67e5\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5340\u5206\u5404\u7a2e\u898f\u6a21\u7684\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8abf\u6574 LM\uff0c\u4f86\u652f\u6301 HRE \u7684\u529f\u6548\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e HRE \u8207\u4eba\u985e\u5224\u65b7\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u95dc\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0d\u6307\u4ee4\u8abf\u6574\u5f8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8b8a\u66f4\u7279\u5225\u654f\u611f\u3002", "author": "Milan Gritta et.al.", "authors": "Milan Gritta, Gerasimos Lampouras, Ignacio Iacobacci", "id": "2405.09186v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09186v1", "repo": "null"}}

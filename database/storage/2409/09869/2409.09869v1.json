Online means that\nin each learning episode, the said environment is stabilized. This, as\ndemonstrated in a case study with a mobile robot simulator, greatly improves\nthe overall learning performance. The base actor-critic scheme of CALF is\nanalogous to SARSA. The latter did not show any success in reaching the target\nin our studies. However, a modified version thereof, called SARSA-m here, did\nsucceed in some learning scenarios. Still, CALF greatly outperformed the said\napproach. CALF was also demonstrated to improve a nominal stabilizer provided\nto it. In summary, the presented agent may be considered a viable approach to\nfusing classical control with reinforcement learning. Its concurrent approaches\nare mostly either offline or model-based, like, for instance, those that fuse\nmodel-predictive control into the agent.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba Lyapunov \u51fd\u6578\u6279\u8a55\u8005 (CALF) \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b83\u7121\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u78ba\u4fdd\u7dda\u4e0a\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u63db\u53e5\u8a71\u8aaa\uff0c\u52d5\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7a69\u5b9a\u3002\u7dda\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6bcf\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u60c5\u7bc0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u8ff0\u74b0\u5883\u6703\u7a69\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4f86\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u5728\u884c\u52d5\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u64ec\u5668\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6240\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u90a3\u6a23\uff0c\u9019\u6975\u5927\u5730\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6574\u9ad4\u5b78\u7fd2\u8868\u73fe\u3002CALF \u7684\u57fa\u672c\u52d5\u4f5c\u6279\u8a55\u8005\u65b9\u6848\u985e\u4f3c\u65bc SARSA\u3002\u5f8c\u8005\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u9054\u5230\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u4fee\u6539\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u7a31\u70ba SARSA-m\uff0c\u78ba\u5be6\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b78\u7fd2\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0cCALF \u4ecd\u5927\u5927\u512a\u65bc\u6240\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002CALF \u4e5f\u88ab\u8b49\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u9032\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d66\u5b83\u7684\u6a19\u7a31\u7a69\u5b9a\u5668\u3002\u7e3d\u4e4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u5c07\u7d93\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u8207\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u878d\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u4e26\u767c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u662f\u96e2\u7dda\u6216\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5c07\u6a21\u578b\u9810\u6e2c\u63a7\u5236\u878d\u5408\u5230\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Pavel Osinenko et.al.", "authors": "Pavel Osinenko, Grigory Yaremenko, Roman Zashchitin, Anton Bolychev, Sinan Ibrahim, Dmitrii Dobriborsci", "id": "2409.09869v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09869v1", "repo": "null"}}

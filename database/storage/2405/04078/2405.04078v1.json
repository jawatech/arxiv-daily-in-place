To advance research on personalized\ntreatment strategies, the effectiveness of various drugs on cells derived from\ncancers (`cell lines') is experimentally determined in laboratory settings.\nNevertheless, variations in the distribution of genomic data and drug responses\nbetween cell lines and humans arise due to biological and environmental\ndifferences. Moreover, while genomic profiles of many cancer patients are\nreadily available, the scarcity of corresponding drug response data limits the\nability to train machine learning models that can predict drug response in\npatients effectively. Recent cancer drug response prediction methods have\nlargely followed the paradigm of unsupervised domain-invariant representation\nlearning followed by a downstream drug response classification step.\nIntroducing supervision in both stages is challenging due to heterogeneous\npatient response to drugs and limited drug response data. This paper addresses\nthese challenges through a novel representation learning method in the first\nphase and weak supervision in the second. Experimental results on real patient\ndata demonstrate the efficacy of our method (WISER) over state-of-the-art\nalternatives on predicting personalized drug response.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u764c\u75c7\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5176\u767c\u751f\u662f\u7531\u65bc\u57fa\u56e0\u9ad4\u6539\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u9593\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u7570\u8cea\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u63a8\u9032\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u6cbb\u7642\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u6703\u6839\u64da\u6e90\u81ea\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u7d30\u80de\uff08\u300c\u7d30\u80de\u682a\u300d\uff09\u4f86\u78ba\u5b9a\u5404\u7a2e\u85e5\u7269\u5c0d\u7d30\u80de\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u751f\u7269\u5b78\u548c\u74b0\u5883\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u7d30\u80de\u682a\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u9ad4\u6578\u64da\u5206\u4f48\u548c\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u96d6\u7136\u8a31\u591a\u764c\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u9ad4\u7279\u5fb5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u53d6\u5f97\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u61c9\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u6578\u64da\u7684\u7a00\u5c11\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8a13\u7df4\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9810\u6e2c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u9810\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u4e86\u7121\u76e3\u7763\u57df\u4e0d\u8b8a\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u518d\u9032\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u5206\u985e\u6b65\u9a5f\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u60a3\u8005\u5c0d\u85e5\u7269\u7684\u53cd\u61c9\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u6578\u64da\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5169\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u76e3\u7763\u662f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u900f\u904e\u7b2c\u4e00\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u8868\u793a\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u5f31\u76e3\u7763\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u3002\u771f\u5be6\u60a3\u8005\u6578\u64da\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08WISER\uff09\u5728\u9810\u6e2c\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u85e5\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "author": "Kumar Shubham et.al.", "authors": "Kumar Shubham, Aishwarya Jayagopal, Syed Mohammed Danish, Prathosh AP, Vaibhav Rajan", "id": "2405.04078v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04078v1", "repo": "null"}}

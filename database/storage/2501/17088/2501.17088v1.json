The Transformer block and its attention mechanism have been the main\ndrivers of the success of these models. Recently, alternative architectures,\nsuch as Selective Structured State Space Models (SSMs), have been proposed to\naddress the inefficiencies of Transformers. This paper explores the compression\nof SSM-based models, particularly Mamba and its hybrids. We study the\nsensitivity of these models to the removal of selected components at different\ngranularities to reduce the model size and computational overhead, thus\nimproving their efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The proposed solutions,\ncollectively referred to as Mamba-Shedder, achieve a speedup of up to 1.4x\nduring inference, demonstrating that model efficiency can be improved by\neliminating several redundancies with minimal impact on the overall model\nperformance.

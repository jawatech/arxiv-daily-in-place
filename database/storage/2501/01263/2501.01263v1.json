Many deep learning (DL) models\nare now embedded in mobile apps, making them more accessible to end users\nthrough on-device DL. However, deploying on-device DL to users' smartphones\nsimultaneously introduces several security threats. One primary threat is\nbackdoor attacks. Extensive research has explored backdoor attacks for several\nyears and has proposed numerous attack approaches. However, few studies have\ninvestigated backdoor attacks on DL models deployed in the real world, or they\nhave shown obvious deficiencies in effectiveness and stealthiness. In this\nwork, we explore more effective and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world DL\nmodels extracted from mobile apps. Our main justification is that imperceptible\nand sample-specific backdoor triggers generated by DNN-based steganography can\nenhance the efficacy of backdoor attacks on real-world models. We first confirm\nthe effectiveness of steganography-based backdoor attacks on four\nstate-of-the-art DNN models. Subsequently, we systematically evaluate and\nanalyze the stealthiness of the attacks to ensure they are difficult to\nperceive. Finally, we implement the backdoor attacks on real-world models and\ncompare our approach with three baseline methods. We collect 38,387 mobile\napps, extract 89 DL models from them, and analyze these models to obtain the\nprerequisite model information for the attacks. After identifying the target\nmodels, our approach achieves an average of 12.50% higher attack success rate\nthan DeepPayload while better maintaining the normal performance of the models.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enables more\neffective, robust, and stealthy backdoor attacks on real-world models.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7db2\u8def\uff08DNN\uff09\u6191\u85c9\u5176\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5df2\u5ee3\u6cdb\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08DL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u73fe\u5df2\u5167\u5d4c\u65bc\u884c\u52d5\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u900f\u904e\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684 DL \u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d6\u5f97\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c07\u88dd\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684 DL \u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u667a\u6167\u578b\u624b\u6a5f\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u9805\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u8105\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u9805\u4e3b\u8981\u5a01\u8105\u5c31\u662f\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u591a\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u5df2\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u653b\u64ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9bae\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8a0e\u90e8\u7f72\u65bc\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684 DL \u6a21\u578b\u6240\u906d\u53d7\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u96b1\u533f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u986f\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u91dd\u5c0d\u5f9e\u884c\u52d5\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c DL \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u96b1\u533f\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8ad6\u9ede\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc DNN \u96b1\u5beb\u8853\u6240\u7522\u751f\u7684\u96e3\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89ba\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u65bc\u6a23\u672c\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u89f8\u767c\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u529b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u78ba\u8a8d\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u96b1\u5beb\u8853\u7684\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u56db\u7a2e\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684 DNN \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u8457\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u5730\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u5206\u6790\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u96b1\u533f\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fdd\u5b83\u5011\u96e3\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89ba\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5be6\u4f5c\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u8207\u4e09\u7a2e\u57fa\u6e96\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6536\u96c6\u4e86 38,387 \u500b\u884c\u52d5\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\u4e86 89 \u500b DL \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53d6\u5f97\u653b\u64ca\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u5728\u627e\u51fa\u76ee\u6a19\u6a21\u578b\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6bd4 DeepPayload \u9054\u5230\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa 12.50% \u7684\u653b\u64ca\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u66f4\u80fd\u7dad\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u8b93\u5f8c\u9580\u653b\u64ca\u5c0d\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5f37\u5065\u4e14\u66f4\u96b1\u533f\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Jiali Wei et.al.", "authors": "Jiali Wei, Ming Fan, Xicheng Zhang, Wenjing Jiao, Haijun Wang, Ting Liu", "id": "2501.01263v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01263v1", "repo": "null"}}

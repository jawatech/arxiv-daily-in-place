This paper offers a\ncomprehensive review of GeoAI as a synergistic concept applying Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) methods and models to geospatial data. A preliminary study is\ncarried out, identifying the methodology of the work, the research motivations,\nthe issues and the directions to be tracked, followed by exploring how GeoAI\ncan be used in various interesting fields of application, such as precision\nagriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban planning.\nNext, a statistical and semantic analysis is carried out, followed by a clear\nand precise presentation of the challenges facing GeoAI. Then, a concrete\nexploration of the future prospects is provided, based on several informations\ngathered during the census. To sum up, this paper provides a complete overview\nof the correlation between AI and the geospatial domain, while mentioning the\nresearches conducted in this context, and emphasizing the close relationship\nlinking GeoAI with other advanced concepts such as geographic information\nsystems (GIS) and large-scale geospatial data, known as big geodata. This will\nenable researchers and scientific community to assess the state of progress in\nthis promising field, and will help other interested parties to gain a better\nunderstanding of the issues involved.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\uff0c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (GeoAI) \u5728\u6700\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u7522\u696d\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u95dc\u6ce8\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u53c3\u8207\u5230\u5404\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u9762\u7684 GeoAI \u7d9c\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u5c07\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u7d9c\u6548\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9805\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8b58\u5225\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u52d5\u6a5f\u3001\u554f\u984c\u548c\u5f85\u8ffd\u8e64\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86 GeoAI \u5982\u4f55\u7528\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u9818\u57df\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7cbe\u6e96\u8fb2\u696d\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u76e3\u6e2c\u3001\u707d\u5bb3\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u90fd\u5e02\u898f\u5283\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u7d71\u8a08\u548c\u8a9e\u7fa9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u6e05\u695a\u4e14\u7cbe\u78ba\u5730\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86 GeoAI \u9762\u81e8\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u666e\u67e5\u671f\u9593\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u5177\u9ad4\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u524d\u666f\u3002\u7e3d\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 AI \u8207\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u9818\u57df\u4e4b\u9593\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u89c0\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u53ca\u5728\u6b64\u8108\u7d61\u4e0b\u9032\u884c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf GeoAI \u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u9032\u968e\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5730\u7406\u8cc7\u8a0a\u7cfb\u7d71 (GIS) \u548c\u7a31\u70ba\u5de8\u91cf\u5730\u7406\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u9593\u8cc7\u6599\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u7dca\u5bc6\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u9019\u5c07\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u548c\u79d1\u5b78\u754c\u80fd\u5920\u8a55\u4f30\u9019\u500b\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u9818\u57df\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u72c0\u6cc1\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5e6b\u52a9\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u7684\u5404\u65b9\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Anasse Boutayeb et.al.", "authors": "Anasse Boutayeb, Iyad Lahsen-cherif, Ahmed El Khadimi", "id": "2412.11643v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11643v1", "repo": "null"}}

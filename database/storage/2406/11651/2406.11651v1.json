Currently, leveraging large language models (LLM) in\nevaluating natural language processing tasks has achieved promising results.\nHowever, using LLM for DST evaluation is still under explored. In this paper,\nwe propose a two-dimensional zero-shot evaluation method for DST using GPT-4,\nwhich divides the evaluation into two dimensions: accuracy and completeness.\nFurthermore, we also design two manual reasoning paths in prompting to further\nimprove the accuracy of evaluation. Experimental results show that our method\nachieves better performance compared to the baselines, and is consistent with\ntraditional exact matching based methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0d\u8a71\u72c0\u614b\u8ffd\u8e64 (DST) \u662f\u7531\u7cbe\u78ba\u6bd4\u5c0d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u5b83\u4f9d\u8cf4\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u4e26\u5ffd\u7565\u8a9e\u610f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u5c0e\u81f4\u8a55\u4f30\u904e\u9ad8\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u6eff\u610f\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u9032\u884c DST \u8a55\u4f30\u4ecd\u8655\u65bc\u63a2\u7d22\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u4f7f\u7528 GPT-4 \u7684\u4e8c\u7dad\u96f6\u6b21\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07\u8a55\u4f30\u5206\u70ba\u5169\u500b\u9762\u5411\uff1a\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u624b\u52d5\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f91\uff0c\u4ee5\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8207\u57fa\u7dda\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73fe\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u7cbe\u78ba\u6bd4\u5c0d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "author": "Ming Gu et.al.", "authors": "Ming Gu, Yan Yang", "id": "2406.11651v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11651v1", "repo": "null"}}

AI-powered technologies and their impact on the English language: wordiness vs. conciseness", "paper_summary": "The proliferation of NLP-powered language technologies, AI-based natural\nlanguage generation models, and English as a mainstream means of communication\namong both native and non-native speakers make the output of AI-powered tools\nespecially intriguing to linguists. This paper investigates how Grammarly and\nChatGPT affect the English language regarding wordiness vs. conciseness. A case\nstudy focusing on the purpose subordinator in order to is presented to\nillustrate the way in which Grammarly and ChatGPT recommend shorter grammatical\nstructures instead of longer and more elaborate ones. Although the analysed\nsentences were produced by native speakers, are perfectly correct, and were\nextracted from a language corpus of contemporary English, both Grammarly and\nChatGPT suggest more conciseness and less verbosity, even for relatively short\nsentences. The present article argues that technologies such as Grammarly not\nonly mirror language change but also have the potential to facilitate or\naccelerate it.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u6280\u8853\u3001\u57fa\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u82f1\u8a9e\u4f5c\u70ba\u6bcd\u8a9e\u548c\u975e\u6bcd\u8a9e\u4eba\u58eb\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6e9d\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u5c0d\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u5bb6\u4f86\u8aaa\u7279\u5225\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86 Grammarly \u548c ChatGPT \u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u97ff\u82f1\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u9577\u8207\u7c21\u6f54\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u76ee\u7684\u5f9e\u5c6c\u9023\u63a5\u8a5e in order to \u70ba\u4f8b\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e Grammarly \u548c ChatGPT \u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u8b70\u4f7f\u7528\u8f03\u77ed\u7684\u8a9e\u6cd5\u7d50\u69cb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8f03\u9577\u4e14\u8f03\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u7531\u6bcd\u8a9e\u4eba\u58eb\u7522\u751f\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u78ba\uff0c\u4e14\u6458\u81ea\u7576\u4ee3\u82f1\u8a9e\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\uff0c\u4f46 Grammarly \u548c ChatGPT \u5373\u4f7f\u5c0d\u65bc\u76f8\u5c0d\u8f03\u77ed\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u4e5f\u5efa\u8b70\u66f4\u7c21\u6f54\u3001\u66f4\u5c11\u5197\u9918\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8a8d\u70ba\uff0c\u50cf Grammarly \u9019\u6a23\u7684\u6280\u8853\u4e0d\u50c5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u9084\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u9032\u6216\u52a0\u901f\u9019\u7a2e\u8b8a\u5316\u3002", "author": "Karolina Rudnicka et.al.", "authors": "Karolina Rudnicka", "id": "2502.04324v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04324v1", "repo": "null"}}

One of such challenges\nis an efficient way for counting the number of incoming and outcoming bees,\nwhich could be used to further analyse many trends, such as the bee colony\nhealth state, blooming periods, or for investigating the effects of\nagricultural spraying. In this paper, we compare three methods for the\nautomated bee counting over two own datasets. The best performing method is\nbased on the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network classifier, which achieved\naccuracy of 87% over the BUT1 dataset and the accuracy of 93% over the BUT2\ndataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5f9e\u871c\u8702\u7fa4\u9ad4\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u614b\u76e3\u63a7\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u96fb\u8166\u8996\u89ba\u6280\u8853\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u6311\u6230\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5730\u8a08\u7b97\u9032\u51fa\u8702\u7fa4\u7684\u6578\u91cf\uff0c\u9019\u80fd\u7528\u4f86\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8a31\u591a\u8da8\u52e2\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u871c\u8702\u7fa4\u9ad4\u5065\u5eb7\u72c0\u614b\u3001\u958b\u82b1\u671f\uff0c\u6216\u7528\u65bc\u8abf\u67e5\u8fb2\u696d\u5674\u7051\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86\u4e09\u500b\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u8a08\u7b97\u871c\u8702\u6578\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5169\u500b\u6211\u5011\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u3002\u8868\u73fe\u6700\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u57fa\u65bc ResNet-50 \u6372\u7a4d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u5728 BUT1 \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9054\u5230 87% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728 BUT2 \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9054\u5230 93% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Simon Bilik et.al.", "authors": "Simon Bilik, Ilona Janakova, Adam Ligocki, Dominik Ficek, Karel Horak", "id": "2406.08898v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08898v1", "repo": "null"}}

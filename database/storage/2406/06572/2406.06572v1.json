Nevertheless, it struggles to capture\nall the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval\nmethods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in\nisolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages\nthat are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, recognizing the\nrelatedness is crucial for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we\npropose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by considering the relatedness between\npassages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting\npassages that are structure-related and keyword-related. A graph neural network\n(GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and\nimprove the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method\nto handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network\n(RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of\npassages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting\npassages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret\nachieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs\nthan strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further\nimproves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4%\naccuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u6aa2\u7d22\u589e\u5f37\u751f\u6210\u5df2\u900f\u904e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8b\u5be6\u652f\u63f4\uff0c\u9769\u65b0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u8f38\u51fa\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5b83\u4ecd\u96e3\u4ee5\u64f7\u53d6\u8907\u96dc\u63a8\u7406\u554f\u984c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6240\u6709\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6aa2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c07\u53c3\u8003\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u6210\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u5b64\u7acb\u8655\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6bb5\u843d\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u95dc\u806f\u7684\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9023\u7e8c\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u6216\u5171\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8b58\u5225\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u5c0d\u65bc\u589e\u5f37\u6aa2\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u540d\u70ba GNN-Ret \u7684\u65b0\u6aa2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u6aa2\u7d22\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8003\u616e\u6bb5\u843d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9996\u5148\u900f\u904e\u9023\u63a5\u7d50\u69cb\u76f8\u95dc\u548c\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u4f86\u5efa\u69cb\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u5716\u5f62\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\u5229\u7528\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u4f86\u5229\u7528\u6bb5\u843d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u4e26\u6539\u5584\u652f\u63f4\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u6aa2\u7d22\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u64f4\u5145\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u540d\u70ba RGNN-Ret \u7684\u905e\u8ff4\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u554f\u984c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u9a5f\u4e2d\uff0cRGNN-Ret \u90fd\u6703\u6574\u5408\u524d\u4e00\u6b65\u9a5f\u4e2d\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u5716\u5f62\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u589e\u5f37\u652f\u63f4\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u6aa2\u7d22\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u6e96\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\uff0cGNN-Ret \u5728\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u7684\u55ae\u4e00\u67e5\u8a62\u4f86\u56de\u7b54\u554f\u984c\u6642\uff0c\u6bd4\u9700\u8981\u591a\u500b\u67e5\u8a62\u7684\u5f37\u5927\u57fa\u6e96\u7dda\u7372\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c RGNN-Ret \u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e26\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5728 2WikiMQA \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 10.4%\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Zijian Li et.al.", "authors": "Zijian Li, Qingyan Guo, Jiawei Shao, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Jun Zhang, Rui Wang", "id": "2406.06572v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06572v1", "repo": "null"}}

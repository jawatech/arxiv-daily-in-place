XAI is\nespecially required in sensitive applications, e.g. in health care, when\ndiagnosis, recommendations and treatment choices might rely on the decisions\nmade by artificial intelligence systems. AI approaches have become widely used\nin aging research as well, in particular, in developing biological clock models\nand identifying biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases. However, the\npotential of XAI here awaits to be fully appreciated. We discuss the\napplication of XAI for developing the \"aging clocks\" and present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the literature categorized by the focus on particular\nphysiological systems.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Alena Kalyakulina et.al.", "authors": "Alena Kalyakulina,Igor Yusipov,Alexey Moskalev,Claudio Franceschi,Mikhail Ivanchenko", "id": "2307.13704v3", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13704v3", "repo": "null"}}

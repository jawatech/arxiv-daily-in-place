Those include using AI as a\nlanguage tutor, creating learning materials, or assessing learner output.\nHowever, due to how AI systems under-stand human language, based on a\nmathematical model using statistical probability, they lack the lived\nexperience to be able to use language with the same social aware-ness as\nhumans. Additionally, there are built-in linguistic and cultural biases based\non their training data which is mostly in English and predominantly from\nWestern sources. Those facts limit AI suitability for some language learning\ninteractions. Stud-ies have clearly shown that systems such as ChatGPT often do\nnot produce language that is pragmatically appropriate. The lack of linguistic\nand cultural authenticity has important implications for how AI is integrated\ninto second language acquisition as well as in instruction targeting\ndevelopment of intercultural communication compe-tence.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c07\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff08\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u6559\u5b78\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u986f\u800c\u6613\u898b\u7684\u597d\u8655\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u597d\u8655\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a9e\u8a00\u5c0e\u5e2b\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u5b78\u7fd2\u6750\u6599\u6216\u8a55\u91cf\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u7684\u7522\u51fa\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u7d71\u8a08\u6a5f\u7387\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ed6\u5011\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6d3b\u7d93\u9a57\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u50cf\u4eba\u985e\u4e00\u6a23\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u610f\u8b58\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u4e3b\u8981\u70ba\u82f1\u6587\u4e14\u591a\u6578\u4f86\u81ea\u897f\u65b9\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5167\u5efa\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u504f\u898b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u4e8b\u5be6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5c0d\u67d0\u4e9b\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u9069\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u78ba\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 ChatGPT \u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u6703\u7522\u751f\u5be6\u7528\u9069\u7576\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u8a9e\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u5c0d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91dd\u5c0d\u57f9\u990a\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u6e9d\u901a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "author": "Robert Godwin-Jones` et.al.", "authors": "Robert Godwin-Jones`", "id": "2410.14395v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14395v1", "repo": "null"}}

As a crucial gateway to human-computer\ninteraction, multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) has also garnered\nsignificant attention, as evidenced by systems like Whisper. However, the\nproprietary nature of the training data has impeded researchers' efforts to\nstudy multilingual ASR. This paper introduces MSR-86K, an evolving, large-scale\nmultilingual corpus for speech recognition research. The corpus is derived from\npublicly accessible videos on YouTube, comprising 15 languages and a total of\n86,300 hours of transcribed ASR data. We also introduce how to use the MSR-86K\ncorpus and other open-source corpora to train a robust multilingual ASR model\nthat is competitive with Whisper. MSR-86K will be publicly released on\nHuggingFace, and we believe that such a large corpus will pave new avenues for\nresearch in multilingual ASR.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u4ee5 ChatGPT \u70ba\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u52a9\u7406\u7372\u5f97\u6975\u5927\u7684\u6b61\u8fce\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u81ea\u52d5\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58 (ASR) \u4e5f\u5099\u53d7\u95dc\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Whisper \u7b49\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u5c08\u6709\u6027\u8cea\u963b\u7919\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00 ASR \u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39 MSR-86K\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4e0d\u65b7\u6f14\u9032\u7684\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u8a9e\u97f3\u8fa8\u8b58\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4f86\u81ea YouTube \u4e0a\u516c\u958b\u7684\u5f71\u7247\uff0c\u5305\u542b 15 \u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u7e3d\u5171 86,300 \u5c0f\u6642\u7684\u8f49\u9304 ASR \u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u4ecb\u7d39\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528 MSR-86K \u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u958b\u6e90\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u4e00\u500b\u5065\u5168\u7684\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00 ASR \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8207 Whisper \u76f8\u7576\u3002MSR-86K \u5c07\u5728 HuggingFace \u4e0a\u516c\u958b\u767c\u5e03\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u5982\u6b64\u9f90\u5927\u7684\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u5c07\u70ba\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00 ASR \u7814\u7a76\u958b\u95e2\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f91\u3002", "author": "Song Li et.al.", "authors": "Song Li, Yongbin You, Xuezhi Wang, Zhengkun Tian, Ke Ding, Guanglu Wan", "id": "2406.18301v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18301v1", "repo": "null"}}

Many industrial applications rely on the consistent\nand systematic use of concepts, especially when dealing with decision-critical\nknowledge. However, we demonstrate that, when methodically questioned, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) often display and demonstrate significant\ninconsistencies in their knowledge. Computationally, the basic aspects of the\nconceptualization of a given domain can be represented as Is-A hierarchies in a\nknowledge graph (KG) or ontology, together with a few properties or axioms that\nenable straightforward reasoning. We show that even simple ontologies can be\nused to reveal conceptual inconsistencies across several LLMs. We also propose\nstrategies that domain experts can use to evaluate and improve the coverage of\nkey domain concepts in LLMs of various sizes. In particular, we have been able\nto significantly enhance the performance of LLMs of various sizes with openly\navailable weights using simple knowledge-graph (KG) based prompting strategies.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6458\u8981\u548c\u7d44\u7e54\u77e5\u8b58\u6210\u70ba\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u7522\u696d\u61c9\u7528\u4ef0\u8cf4\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7cfb\u7d71\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728\u8655\u7406\u6c7a\u7b56\u95dc\u9375\u77e5\u8b58\u6642\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u7576\u7d93\u904e\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u5730\u8cea\u7591\u6642\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7d93\u5e38\u986f\u793a\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u77e5\u8b58\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u8a08\u7b97\u4e0a\uff0c\u7d66\u5b9a\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u6216\u672c\u9ad4\u8ad6\u4e2d\u7684 Is-A \u968e\u5c64\u4f86\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c6c\u6027\u6216\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5c6c\u6027\u6216\u516c\u7406\u80fd\u9032\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u672c\u9ad4\u8ad6\u4e5f\u80fd\u7528\u4f86\u63ed\u9732\u8de8\u591a\u500b LLM \u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u5584\u5404\u7a2e\u898f\u6a21 LLM \u4e2d\u95dc\u9375\u9818\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\u6db5\u84cb\u7bc4\u570d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u7d93\u80fd\u5920\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65bc\u7c21\u55ae\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c (KG) \u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7a2e\u898f\u6a21 LLM \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b LLM \u4f7f\u7528\u958b\u653e\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6b0a\u91cd\u3002", "author": "Rosario Uceda-Sosa et.al.", "authors": "Rosario Uceda-Sosa, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Maria Chang, Moninder Singh", "id": "2405.20163v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20163v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2409.02078": {"publish_time": "2024-09-03", "title": "Political DEBATE: Efficient Zero-shot and Few-shot Classifiers for Political Text", "paper_summary": "Social scientists quickly adopted large language models due to their ability\nto annotate documents without supervised training, an ability known as\nzero-shot learning. However, due to their compute demands, cost, and often\nproprietary nature, these models are often at odds with replication and open\nscience standards. This paper introduces the Political DEBATE (DeBERTa\nAlgorithm for Textual Entailment) language models for zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification of political documents. These models are not only as good, or\nbetter than, state-of-the art large language models at zero and few-shot\nclassification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open\nsource. By training the models on a simple random sample of 10-25 documents,\nthey can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of\ndocuments and state-of-the-art generative models with complex, engineered\nprompts. Additionally, we release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models\n-- a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels\nacross over 800 classification tasks.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u793e\u6703\u79d1\u5b78\u5bb6\u5f88\u5feb\u4fbf\u63a1\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u6c92\u6709\u76e3\u7763\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u8a3b\u89e3\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u9019\u9805\u80fd\u529b\u7a31\u70ba\u96f6\u6b21\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u65bc\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u5c08\u6709\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8207\u8907\u88fd\u548c\u958b\u653e\u79d1\u5b78\u6a19\u6e96\u76f8\u885d\u7a81\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u7528\u65bc\u96f6\u6b21\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u653f\u6cbb\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u985e\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u8faf\u8ad6\uff08\u6587\u672c\u542b\u7fa9\u7684 DeBERTa \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u50c5\u8207\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6b21\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u5206\u985e\u4e2d\u4e00\u6a23\u597d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa\u5e7e\u500b\u6578\u91cf\u7d1a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u958b\u653e\u539f\u59cb\u78bc\u3002\u901a\u904e\u5728 10-25 \u4efd\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u7c21\u55ae\u96a8\u6a5f\u6a23\u672c\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u5728\u6578\u767e\u6216\u6578\u5343\u4efd\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u76e3\u7763\u5206\u985e\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u8907\u96dc\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u9032\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u5e03\u4e86\u7528\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684 PolNLI \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u500b\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u904e 200,000 \u4efd\u653f\u6cbb\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u4e3b\u9ad4\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6587\u4ef6\u5728 800 \u591a\u500b\u5206\u985e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u6a19\u7c64\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Michael Burnham et.al.", "authors": "Michael Burnham, Kayla Kahn, Ryan Yank Wang, Rachel X.

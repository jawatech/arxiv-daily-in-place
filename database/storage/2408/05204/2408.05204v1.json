Known for their expertise across\ndiverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs\nhold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this\npotential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This\npaper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to\nevaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts\nfor middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student\nlearning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the\nexperimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the\nstudent's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts\nwere rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a\nMann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10\nlevel) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p =\n.059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor\neducational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant\nadvancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical\nconsiderations for using artificial intelligence in education are also\ndiscussed.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec OpenAI \u7684 GPT \u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u4f86\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u9032\u5c55\u3002LLM \u4ee5\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u984c\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5c08\u696d\u77e5\u8b58\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u9069\u61c9\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u800c\u805e\u540d\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff08PL\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5177\u6709\u7368\u7279\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u9019\u7a2e\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5728 K-12 \u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u96a8\u6a5f\u5c0d\u7167\u8a66\u9a57\uff08n = 23\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a55\u4f30 GPT-4 \u5728\u70ba\u4e2d\u5b78\u751f\u500b\u6027\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u79d1\u5b78\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cGPT-4 \u7528\u65bc\u6839\u64da\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u4f86\u63cf\u7e6a\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u504f\u597d\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u5be6\u9a57\u7d44\uff0cGPT-4 \u7528\u65bc\u91cd\u5beb\u79d1\u5b78\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u8207\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u7279\u5fb5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5c0d\u7167\u7d44\u4e2d\u7684\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u88ab\u91cd\u5beb\u4ee5\u8207\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002Mann-Whitney U \u6aa2\u5b9a\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7576\u91cd\u5beb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8207\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u4e00\u81f4\u6642\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u986f\u8457\u504f\u597d\uff08\u5728 .10 \u6c34\u6e96\u4e0a\uff09\u91cd\u5beb\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff08p = .059\uff09\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u8868\u660e\uff0cGPT-4 \u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u8abf\u6574\u6559\u80b2\u5167\u5bb9\u4ee5\u9069\u61c9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6a19\u8a8c\u8457 PL \u6280\u8853\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u9032\u6b65\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u502b\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u4e5f\u5c07\u4e88\u4ee5\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002", "author": "Michael Vaccaro Jr et.al.", "authors": "Michael Vaccaro Jr, Mikayla Friday, Arash Zaghi", "id": "2408.05204v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05204v1", "repo": "null"}}

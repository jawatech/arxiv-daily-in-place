As a specific\ntest scenario, we applied these models to the guidelines for hypertension in\nchildren and adolescents provided by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).\nLeveraging Streamlit, a Python library, we developed a user-friendly medical\ndocument chatbot tool (MedDoc-Bot). This tool enables authorized users to\nupload PDF files and pose questions, generating interpretive responses from\nfour locally stored LLMs. A pediatric expert provides a benchmark for\nevaluation by formulating questions and responses extracted from the ESC\nguidelines. The expert rates the model-generated responses based on their\nfidelity and relevance. Additionally, we evaluated the METEOR and chrF metric\nscores to assess the similarity of model responses to reference answers. Our\nstudy found that Llama-2 and Mistral performed well in metrics evaluation.\nHowever, Llama-2 was slower when dealing with text and tabular data. In our\nhuman evaluation, we observed that responses created by Mistral, Meditron, and\nLlama-2 exhibited reasonable fidelity and relevance. This study provides\nvaluable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs for future\ndevelopments in medical document interpretation.

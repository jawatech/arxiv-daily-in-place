Compared to single agents, multi-agent systems have higher\nrequirements for the collaboration capabilities of language models. Many\nbenchmarks are proposed to evaluate their collaborative abilities. However,\nthese benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluations of LLM collaborative\ncapabilities. Additionally, multi-agent collaborative and competitive scenarios\nare ignored in existing works. To address these two problems, we propose a\nbenchmark, called BattleAgentBench, which defines seven sub-stages of three\nvarying difficulty levels and conducts a fine-grained evaluation of language\nmodels in terms of single-agent scenario navigation capabilities, paired-agent\ntask execution abilities, and multi-agent collaboration and competition\ncapabilities. We conducted extensive evaluations on leading four closed-source\nand seven open-source models. Experimental results indicate that API-based\nmodels perform excellently on simple tasks but open-source small models\nstruggle with simple tasks. Regarding difficult tasks that require\ncollaborative and competitive abilities, although API-based models have\ndemonstrated some collaborative capabilities, there is still enormous room for\nimprovement.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u5f37\u5927\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u80fd\u5920\u8655\u7406\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u55ae\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u8207\u55ae\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u57fa\u6e96\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u4f30\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u5354\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u57fa\u6e96\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0d LLM \u5354\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5354\u4f5c\u548c\u7af6\u722d\u5834\u666f\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u5169\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba BattleAgentBench\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u4e09\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u96e3\u5ea6\u7d1a\u5225\u7684\u4e03\u500b\u5b50\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u55ae\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u5834\u666f\u5c0e\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u914d\u5c0d\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52d9\u57f7\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5354\u4f5c\u548c\u7af6\u722d\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u7d30\u7c92\u5ea6\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u9818\u5148\u7684\u56db\u500b\u9589\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e03\u500b\u958b\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc API \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c21\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u958b\u6e90\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c21\u55ae\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5c0d\u65bc\u9700\u8981\u5354\u4f5c\u548c\u7af6\u722d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u56f0\u96e3\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u57fa\u65bc API \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7d93\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5354\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6539\u9032\u7a7a\u9593\u3002", "author": "Wei Wang et.al.", "authors": "Wei Wang, Dan Zhang, Tao Feng, Boyan Wang, Jie Tang", "id": "2408.15971v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15971v1", "repo": "null"}}

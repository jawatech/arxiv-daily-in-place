However, there are differences between the two in terms of\nhow they process data, primarily because they often use different data\nrepresentation methods, which is often an important factor limiting the overall\nperformance of the two. From this perspective, we analyzed 191 studies from\n2013 by constructing a four-level classification framework. The first level\ndefines five types of representation spaces, and the second level focuses on\nfive types of information modalities that the representation space can\nrepresent. Then, the third level describes four symbolic logic methods.\nFinally, the fourth-level categories propose three collaboration strategies\nbetween neural networks and symbolic learning. Furthermore, we conducted a\ndetailed analysis of 46 research based on their representation space.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f AI \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d50\u5408\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u7b26\u865f\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u4f86\u63d0\u5347 AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5169\u8005\u5728\u8655\u7406\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u9019\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u7d93\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u8868\u5fb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9650\u5236\u5169\u8005\u6574\u9ad4\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5f9e\u9019\u500b\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5efa\u69cb\u4e00\u500b\u56db\u5c64\u7d1a\u5206\u985e\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u5206\u6790 2013 \u5e74\u4ee5\u4f86\u7684 191 \u9805\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c64\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u4e94\u7a2e\u985e\u578b\u7684\u8868\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c64\u5247\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u8868\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u5fb5\u7684\u4e94\u7a2e\u985e\u578b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u63a5\u8457\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u5c64\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u56db\u7a2e\u7b26\u865f\u908f\u8f2f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u7b2c\u56db\u5c64\u985e\u5225\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u548c\u7b26\u865f\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u4e09\u7a2e\u5354\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c0d 46 \u9805\u7814\u7a76\u6839\u64da\u5176\u8868\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u8a73\u7d30\u5206\u6790\u3002", "author": "Xin Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Xin Zhang, Victor S.

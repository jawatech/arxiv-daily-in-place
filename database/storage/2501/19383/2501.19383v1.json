In this\nwork, we provide theoretical grounds for this capability and furthermore\ninvestigate the utility of causal auto-regressive sequence models when they are\napplied to any feature representation. We find that, despite being trained in\nthe usual way - for next-token prediction via cross-entropy loss -\ndecoding-based regression is as performant as traditional approaches for\ntabular regression tasks, while being flexible enough to capture arbitrary\ndistributions, such as in the task of density estimation.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u8b49\u660e\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u57f7\u884c\u56de\u6b78\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6578\u503c\u9810\u6e2c\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u89e3\u78bc\u5b57\u4e32\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u70ba\u6b64\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8ad6\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4e26\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8a0e\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u6b78\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u4efb\u4f55\u7279\u5fb5\u8868\u793a\u6642\u4e4b\u6548\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u4ee5\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\uff08\u900f\u904e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u640d\u5931\u9032\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u7b26\u865f\u9810\u6e2c\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u65bc\u89e3\u78bc\u7684\u56de\u6b78\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u6a23\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u8868\u683c\u56de\u6b78\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u8db3\u5920\u9748\u6d3b\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u4f48\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8a08\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u3002", "author": "Xingyou Song et.al.", "authors": "Xingyou Song, Dara Bahri", "id": "2501.19383v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19383v1", "repo": "https://github.com/google-research/optformer"}}

Despite this prior work, existing approaches\nto estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units,\nrepresent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous\ndata-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating\nindividual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is\nrepresented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This\napproach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each\ncomponent and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the\nunit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional\napproach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate\ncounterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved\noverlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the\nclassical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of\nnovel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and\nreal-world data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a31\u591a\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u70ba\u4e92\u52d5\u7d44\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002\n\u6b64\u985e\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\u904b\u7b97\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u67e5\u8a62\u8655\u7406\u5668\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7d30\u80de\uff09\u548c\u793e\u6703\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5bb6\u5ead\uff09\u3002\n\u50b3\u7d71\uff08\u95dc\u806f\u5f0f\uff09\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u8a31\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u5efa\u6a21\u6b64\u985e\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7d71\u8a08\u95dc\u4fc2\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5716\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u9019\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u4f30\u8a08\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c07\u6b64\u985e\u7cfb\u7d71\u8996\u70ba\u55ae\u4e00\u55ae\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7d44\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8b8a\u6578\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u4e26\u5047\u8a2d\u8cc7\u6599\u7522\u751f\u904e\u7a0b\u662f\u540c\u8cea\u7684\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u7a2e\u7d44\u5408\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u4f30\u8a08\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u500b\u5225\u8655\u7406\u6548\u679c (ITE)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u500b\u55ae\u4f4d\u90fd\u7531\u591a\u500b\u7570\u8cea\u7d44\u4ef6\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u7d44\u5316\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u500b\u7d44\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4e26\u5f59\u7e3d\u7d44\u4ef6\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7d50\u679c\u4ee5\u7372\u5f97\u55ae\u4f4d\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u7d44\u5408\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u8ad6\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u512a\u9ede - \u7cfb\u7d71\u5316\u6982\u5316\u4ee5\u4f30\u8a08\u672a\u898b\u7d44\u4ef6\u7d44\u5408\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5be6\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8207\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u4f30\u8a08\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8655\u7406\u7d44\u548c\u5c0d\u7167\u7d44\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u91cd\u758a\u4fdd\u8b49\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u7d44\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7d93\u9a57\u8a55\u4f30\u7d44\u5408\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u64ec\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "author": "Purva Pruthi et.al.", "authors": "Purva Pruthi, David Jensen", "id": "2406.17714v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17714v1", "repo": "null"}}

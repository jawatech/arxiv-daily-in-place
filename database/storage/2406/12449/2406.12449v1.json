However, it also exhibits limitations.\nIn response, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a potential\nsolution, enabling models to generate more accurate contents by leveraging the\nretrieval of external knowledge. With the rapid advancement of generative AI,\nRAG can pave the way for connecting this transformative technology with medical\napplications and is expected to bring innovations in equity, reliability, and\npersonalization to health care.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (AI) \u5df2\u70ba\u5305\u62ec\u91ab\u5b78\u5728\u5167\u7684\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u5e36\u4f86\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u5275\u65b0\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6aa2\u7d22\u589e\u5f37\u751f\u6210 (RAG) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u6aa2\u7d22\u4f86\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u751f\u6210\u5f0f AI \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9032\u5c55\uff0cRAG \u53ef\u4ee5\u70ba\u5c07\u9019\u9805\u8f49\u578b\u6280\u8853\u8207\u91ab\u7642\u61c9\u7528\u76f8\u9023\u92ea\u8def\uff0c\u4e26\u6709\u671b\u70ba\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u5e36\u4f86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u5275\u65b0\u3002", "author": "Rui Yang et.al.", "authors": "Rui Yang, Yilin Ning, Emilia Keppo, Mingxuan Liu, Chuan Hong, Danielle S Bitterman, Jasmine Chiat Ling Ong, Daniel Shu Wei Ting, Nan Liu", "id": "2406.12449v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12449v1", "repo": "null"}}

The problems in the healthcare\nare complex since to solve them several constraints and different type of\nresources should be taken into account. Moreover, the solutions must be\nevaluated in a small amount of time to ensure the usability in real scenarios.\nWe plan to propose solutions to these kind of problems both expanding already\ntested solutions and by modelling solutions for new problems, taking into\naccount the literature and by using real data when available. Solving these\nkind of problems is important but, since the European Commission established\nwith the General Data Protection Regulation that each person has the right to\nask for explanation of the decision taken by an AI, without developing\nExplainability methodologies the usage of AI based solvers e.g. those based on\nAnswer Set programming will be limited. Thus, another part of the research will\nbe devoted to study and propose new methodologies for explaining the solutions\nobtained.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Marco Mochi et.al.", "authors": "Marco Mochi", "id": "2208.03099v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03099v1", "repo": "null"}}

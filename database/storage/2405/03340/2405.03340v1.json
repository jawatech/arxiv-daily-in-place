Functional equivalence allows organisms to\ncategorize and respond to varied stimuli based on their utility rather than\nperceptual similarity, thus enhancing cognitive efficiency and adaptability. In\nthis study, ONA was modified to allow the derivation of functional equivalence.\nThis paper provides practical examples of the capability of ONA to apply\nlearned knowledge across different functional situations, demonstrating its\nutility in complex problem-solving and decision-making. An extended example is\nincluded, where training of ONA aimed to learn basic human-like language\nabilities, using a systematic procedure in relating spoken words, objects and\nwritten words. The research carried out as part of this study extends the\nunderstanding of functional equivalence in AGI systems, and argues for its\nnecessity for level of flexibility in learning and adapting necessary for\nhuman-level AGI.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Robert Johansson et.al.", "authors": "Robert Johansson,Patrick Hammer,Tony Lofthouse", "id": "2405.03340v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03340v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2407.07786": {"publish_time": "2024-07-10", "title": "The Human Factor in AI Red Teaming: Perspectives from Social and Collaborative Computing", "paper_summary": "Rapid progress in general-purpose AI has sparked significant interest in \"red\nteaming,\" a practice of adversarial testing originating in military and\ncybersecurity applications. AI red teaming raises many questions about the\nhuman factor, such as how red teamers are selected, biases and blindspots in\nhow tests are conducted, and harmful content's psychological effects on red\nteamers. A growing body of HCI and CSCW literature examines related\npractices-including data labeling, content moderation, and algorithmic\nauditing. However, few, if any, have investigated red teaming itself. This\nworkshop seeks to consider the conceptual and empirical challenges associated\nwith this practice, often rendered opaque by non-disclosure agreements. Future\nstudies may explore topics ranging from fairness to mental health and other\nareas of potential harm. We aim to facilitate a community of researchers and\npractitioners who can begin to meet these challenges with creativity,\ninnovation, and thoughtful reflection.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e00\u822c\u7528\u9014 AI \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9032\u5c55\u5f15\u767c\u4e86\u5c0d\u300c\u7d05\u968a\u300d\u7684\u6fc3\u539a\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u7d05\u968a\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u6e90\u81ea\u8ecd\u4e8b\u548c\u7db2\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u61c9\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0d\u6297\u6027\u6e2c\u8a66\u5be6\u52d9\u3002AI \u7d05\u968a\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u56e0\u7d20\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7d05\u968a\u6210\u54e1\u5982\u4f55\u9078\u62d4\u3001\u6e2c\u8a66\u57f7\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u898b\u548c\u76f2\u9ede\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u5bb3\u5167\u5bb9\u5c0d\u7d05\u968a\u6210\u54e1\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u6a5f\u4e92\u52d5\u548c CSCW \u6587\u737b\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u76f8\u95dc\u5be6\u52d9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8cc7\u6599\u6a19\u8a18\u3001\u5167\u5bb9\u5be9\u6838\u548c\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a3d\u6838\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9bae\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u63a2\u8a0e\u7d05\u968a\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8a0e\u8207\u6b64\u5be6\u52d9\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7d93\u9a57\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u901a\u5e38\u56e0\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5354\u8b70\u800c\u8b8a\u5f97\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u3002\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u63a2\u8a0e\u5f9e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5230\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5b\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u9818\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u4fc3\u9032\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u548c\u5be6\u52d9\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u793e\u7fa4\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u958b\u59cb\u904b\u7528\u5275\u610f\u3001\u5275\u65b0\u548c\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u616e\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u4f86\u61c9\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u6311\u6230\u3002", "author": "Alice Qian Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Alice Qian Zhang, Ryland Shaw, Jacy Reese Anthis, Ashlee Milton, Emily Tseng, Jina Suh, Lama Ahmad, Ram Shankar Siva Kumar, Julian Posada, Benjamin Shestakofsky, Sarah T.

This emphasis has primarily focused on the spoof\nclass. Recently, several studies have noted that the distribution of silence\ndiffers between the two classes, which can serve as a shortcut. In this paper,\nwe extend class-wise interpretations beyond silence. We employ loss analysis\nand asymmetric methodologies to move away from traditional attack-focused and\nresult-oriented evaluations towards a deeper examination of model behaviors.\nOur investigations highlight the significant differences in training dynamics\nbetween the two classes, emphasizing the need for future research to focus on\nrobust modeling of the bonafide class.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7576\u524d\u97f3\u8a0a\u9632\u507d\u5075\u6e2c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8da8\u52e2\u81f4\u529b\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u672a\u898b\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u6982\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b78\u7fd2\u8b58\u5225\u5404\u7a2e\u507d\u9020\u4eba\u5de5\u88fd\u54c1\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u91cd\u9ede\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u507d\u9020\u985e\u5225\u4e0a\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u591a\u9805\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5169\u7a2e\u985e\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u975c\u9ed8\u5206\u4f48\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u70ba\u6377\u5f91\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u985e\u5225\u89e3\u91cb\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u975c\u9ed8\u4e4b\u5916\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u640d\u5931\u5206\u6790\u548c\u975e\u5c0d\u7a31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f9e\u50b3\u7d71\u4ee5\u653b\u64ca\u70ba\u91cd\u9ede\u548c\u4ee5\u7d50\u679c\u70ba\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\u8f49\u5411\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u63a2\u8a0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u70ba\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u985e\u5225\u4e4b\u9593\u8a13\u7df4\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u986f\u8457\u5dee\u7570\uff0c\u5f37\u8abf\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u771f\u5be6\u985e\u5225\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "author": "Hye-jin Shim et.al.", "authors": "Hye-jin Shim, Md Sahidullah, Jee-weon Jung, Shinji Watanabe, Tomi Kinnunen", "id": "2406.17246v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17246v1", "repo": "null"}}

This method, previously studied only in a Euclidean\nspace, is reformulated in a statistical manifold via the Fisher-Rao distance.\nLanguage exhibits a multifractal, with global self-similarity and a universal\ndimension around 6.5, which is smaller than those of simple discrete random\nsequences and larger than that of a Barab\\'asi-Albert process. Long memory is\nthe key to producing self-similarity. Our method is applicable to any\nprobabilistic model of real-world discrete sequences, and we show an\napplication to music data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u901a\u904e\u5c07 Grassberger-Procaccia \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7522\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u7dad\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f86\u6e2c\u91cf\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u95dc\u806f\u7dad\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5148\u524d\u50c5\u5728\u6b50\u5e7e\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u900f\u904e Fisher-Rao \u8ddd\u96e2\u5728\u7d71\u8a08\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u3002\u8a9e\u8a00\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u591a\u91cd\u5206\u5f62\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6574\u9ad4\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u7d04 6.5 \u7684\u901a\u7528\u7dad\u5ea6\uff0c\u9019\u5c0f\u65bc\u7c21\u55ae\u96e2\u6563\u96a8\u6a5f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7dad\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u65bc Barab\u00e1si-Albert \u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7dad\u5ea6\u3002\u9577\u6642\u8a18\u61b6\u662f\u7522\u751f\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9069\u7528\u65bc\u4efb\u4f55\u5be6\u969b\u4e16\u754c\u96e2\u6563\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6a5f\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u97f3\u6a02\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u3002", "author": "Xin Du et.al.", "authors": "Xin Du, Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii", "id": "2405.06321v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06321v1", "repo": "null"}}

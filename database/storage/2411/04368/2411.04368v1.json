We prioritized two properties\nin designing this eval. First, SimpleQA is challenging, as it is adversarially\ncollected against GPT-4 responses. Second, responses are easy to grade, because\nquestions are created such that there exists only a single, indisputable\nanswer. Each answer in SimpleQA is graded as either correct, incorrect, or not\nattempted. A model with ideal behavior would get as many questions correct as\npossible while not attempting the questions for which it is not confident it\nknows the correct answer. SimpleQA is a simple, targeted evaluation for whether\nmodels \"know what they know,\" and our hope is that this benchmark will remain\nrelevant for the next few generations of frontier models.

Previous\nalgorithms primarily rely on point cloud, which, despite offering precise\ngeometric information, still constrain perception performance due to inherent\nsparsity, noise, and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce a novel\nimage-centric 3D perception model, BIP3D, which leverages expressive image\nfeatures with explicit 3D position encoding to overcome the limitations of\npoint-centric methods. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained 2D vision\nfoundation models to enhance semantic understanding, and introduce a spatial\nenhancer module to improve spatial understanding. Together, these modules\nenable BIP3D to achieve multi-view, multi-modal feature fusion and end-to-end\n3D perception. In our experiments, BIP3D outperforms current state-of-the-art\nresults on the EmbodiedScan benchmark, achieving improvements of 5.69% in the\n3D detection task and 15.25% in the 3D visual grounding task.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u662f 3D \u611f\u77e5\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u5920\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5468\u570d\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8cf4\u9ede\u96f2\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u78ba\u7684\u5e7e\u4f55\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u96dc\u8a0a\u548c\u8cc7\u6599\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u6703\u9650\u5236\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u4ee5\u5f71\u50cf\u70ba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684 3D \u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b BIP3D\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5177\u6709\u660e\u78ba 3D \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7de8\u78bc\u7684\u8868\u9054\u6027\u5f71\u50cf\u7279\u5fb5\u4f86\u514b\u670d\u4ee5\u9ede\u70ba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684 2D \u8996\u89ba\u57fa\u790e\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u8a9e\u610f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e26\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u500b\u7a7a\u9593\u589e\u5f37\u5668\u6a21\u7d44\u4f86\u6539\u5584\u7a7a\u9593\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u7d44\u5171\u540c\u4f7f BIP3D \u80fd\u5920\u5be6\u73fe\u591a\u8996\u5716\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7279\u5fb5\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684 3D \u611f\u77e5\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u4e2d\uff0cBIP3D \u5728 EmbodiedScan \u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u512a\u65bc\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u5728 3D \u5075\u6e2c\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u6539\u9032\u4e86 5.69%\uff0c\u5728 3D \u8996\u89ba\u57fa\u790e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u6539\u9032\u4e86 15.25%\u3002", "author": "Xuewu Lin et.al.", "authors": "Xuewu Lin, Tianwei Lin, Lichao Huang, Hongyu Xie, Zhizhong Su", "id": "2411.14869v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14869v1", "repo": "null"}}

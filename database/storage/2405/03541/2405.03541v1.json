However,\ntheir application in brain tumour detection remains underexplored. This study\nproposes RepVGG-GELAN, a novel YOLO architecture enhanced with RepVGG, a\nreparameterized convolutional approach for object detection tasks particularly\nfocusing on brain tumour detection within medical images. RepVGG-GELAN\nleverages the RepVGG architecture to improve both speed and accuracy in\ndetecting brain tumours. Integrating RepVGG into the YOLO framework aims to\nachieve a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance.\nThis study includes a spatial pyramid pooling-based Generalized Efficient Layer\nAggregation Network (GELAN) architecture which further enhances the capability\nof RepVGG. Experimental evaluation conducted on a brain tumour dataset\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of RepVGG-GELAN surpassing existing RCS-YOLO in\nterms of precision and speed. Specifically, RepVGG-GELAN achieves an increased\nprecision of 4.91% and an increased AP50 of 2.54% over the latest existing\napproach while operating at 240.7 GFLOPs. The proposed RepVGG-GELAN with GELAN\narchitecture presents promising results establishing itself as a\nstate-of-the-art solution for accurate and efficient brain tumour detection in\nmedical images.

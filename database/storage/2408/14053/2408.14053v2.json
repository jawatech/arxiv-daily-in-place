We theorize that using chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting to evaluate Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scores will\nimprove the accuracy of the scores determined by AI models. In our findings,\nwhen the models reasoned with CoT, the estimated PHQ-8 scores were consistently\ncloser on average to the accepted true scores reported by each participant\ncompared to when not using CoT. Our goal is to expand upon AI models'\nunderstanding of the intricacies of human conversation, allowing them to more\neffectively assess a patient's feelings and tone, therefore being able to more\naccurately discern mental disorder symptoms; ultimately, we hope to augment AI\nmodels' abilities, so that they can be widely accessible and used in the\nmedical field.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7576\u4f7f\u7528 AI \u4f86\u5075\u6e2c\u6182\u9b31\u75c7\u7684\u5fb5\u5146\u6642\uff0cAI \u6a21\u578b\u7fd2\u6163\u6027\u5730\u5f97\u51fa\u5148\u767c\u5236\u4eba\u7684\u7d50\u8ad6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5047\u8a2d\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u93c8 (CoT) \u63d0\u793a\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u554f\u5377 8 (PHQ-8) \u5206\u6578\uff0c\u5c07\u6703\u63d0\u5347 AI \u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6c7a\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u6578\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6211\u5011\u7684\u767c\u73fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u7576\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528 CoT \u63a8\u7406\u6642\uff0c\u4f30\u8a08\u7684 PHQ-8 \u5206\u6578\u5e73\u5747\u4f86\u8aaa\u6301\u7e8c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6bcf\u500b\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u6240\u5831\u544a\u7684\u516c\u8a8d\u771f\u5be6\u5206\u6578\uff0c\u76f8\u8f03\u65bc\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528 CoT \u6642\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u64f4\u5c55 AI \u6a21\u578b\u5c0d\u65bc\u4eba\u985e\u5c0d\u8a71\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8b93\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8a55\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u548c\u8a9e\u6c23\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u5730\u8fa8\u5225\u5fc3\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u75c7\u72c0\uff1b\u6700\u7d42\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u589e\u5f37 AI \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8b93\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5ee3\u6cdb\u5730\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u65bc\u91ab\u7642\u9818\u57df\u3002", "author": "Elysia Shi et.al.", "authors": "Elysia Shi, Adithri Manda, London Chowdhury, Runeema Arun, Kevin Zhu, Michael Lam", "id": "2408.14053v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14053v2", "repo": "null"}}

Recently, these databases have taken up the UN's Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) in their respective classifications, which have been\ncriticised for their diverging nature. This work proposes using the feature of\nlarge language models (LLMs) to learn about the \"data bias\" injected by diverse\nSDG classifications into bibliometric data by exploring five SDGs. We build a\nLLM that is fine-tuned in parallel by the diverse SDG classifications inscribed\ninto the databases' SDG classifications. Our results show high sensitivity in\nmodel architecture, classified publications, fine-tuning process, and natural\nlanguage generation. The wide arbitrariness at different levels raises concerns\nabout using LLM in research practice.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Matteo Ottaviani et.al.", "authors": "Matteo Ottaviani,Stephan Stahlschmidt", "id": "2405.03007v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03007v1", "repo": "null"}}

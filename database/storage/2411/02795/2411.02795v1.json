RWKV combines the training efficiency of Transformers with the\ninference efficiency of RNNs through a novel linear attention mechanism. We\nexamine its core innovations, adaptations across various domains, and\nperformance advantages over traditional models. The paper also discusses\nchallenges and future directions for RWKV as a versatile architecture in deep\nlearning.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u9867\u4e86\u63a5\u53d7\u6b0a\u91cd\u95dc\u9375\u503c (RWKV) \u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u8aaa\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u8a9e\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u3002RWKV \u900f\u904e\u5275\u65b0\u7684\u7dda\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u7d50\u5408\u4e86 Transformer \u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u6548\u7387\u548c RNN \u7684\u63a8\u8ad6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6aa2\u8996\u4e86\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5275\u65b0\u3001\u5728\u5404\u500b\u9818\u57df\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u8f03\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u512a\u52e2\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4e5f\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86 RWKV \u4f5c\u70ba\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e2d\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u67b6\u69cb\u6240\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u6311\u6230\u548c\u672a\u4f86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Akul Datta et.al.", "authors": "Akul Datta", "id": "2411.02795v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02795v1", "repo": "null"}}

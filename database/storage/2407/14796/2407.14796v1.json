However, the common practice that complete-modality data is visible\nduring model training is far from realistic, as modalities can have imbalanced\nmissing rates in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we, for the first time,\nformulate such a challenging setting and propose Preference-Aware\nSelf-diStillatION (PASSION) for incomplete multi-modal medical image\nsegmentation under imbalanced missing rates. Specifically, we first construct\npixel-wise and semantic-wise self-distillation to balance the optimization\nobjective of each modality. Then, we define relative preference to evaluate the\ndominance of each modality during training, based on which to design task-wise\nand gradient-wise regularization to balance the convergence rates of different\nmodalities. Experimental results on two publicly available multi-modal datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of PASSION against existing approaches for modality\nbalancing. More importantly, PASSION is validated to work as a plug-and-play\nmodule for consistent performance improvement across different backbones.

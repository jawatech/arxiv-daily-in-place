This\nproject aims to develop a state-of-the-art AI-based system for diagnosing\nCovid-19 pneumonia from Chest X-ray (CXR) images. The contributions of this\nwork are manyfold: the release of the public CORDA dataset, a deep learning\npipeline for Covid-19 detection, and the clinical validation of the developed\nsolution by expert radiologists. The proposed detection model is based on a\ntwo-step approach that, paired with state-of-the-art debiasing, provides\nreliable results. Most importantly, our investigation includes the actual usage\nof the diagnosis aid tool by radiologists, allowing us to assess the real\nbenefits in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.

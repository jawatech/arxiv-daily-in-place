Most previous work is\nbased on optimizing the hyperparameters of a heuristic function. We propose to\nmodel the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective\nof maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a novel constraint\noptimization algorithm that stabilizes objective trade-offs for multi-objective\noptimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its\ndeployment on YouTube.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b78\u7fd2\u6392\u540d\u51fd\u6578 (LRF)\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5b83\u63a5\u6536\u77ed\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u8005-\u9805\u76ee\u884c\u70ba\u9810\u6e2c\u4f5c\u70ba\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u8f38\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u63a8\u85a6\u6e05\u55ae\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91dd\u5c0d\u9577\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u9032\u884c\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6578\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u57fa\u65bc\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u555f\u767c\u5f0f\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u8d85\u53c3\u6578\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u8b70\u5c07\u554f\u984c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u6e05\u55ae\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9577\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u6eff\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u7d04\u675f\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7a69\u5b9a\u591a\u76ee\u6a19\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u6b0a\u8861\u3002\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u6642\u5be6\u9a57\u8a55\u4f30\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u8aaa\u660e\u5b83\u5728 YouTube \u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "author": "Yi Wu et.al.", "authors": "Yi Wu, Daryl Chang, Jennifer She, Zhe Zhao, Li Wei, Lukasz Heldt", "id": "2408.06512v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06512v1", "repo": "null"}}

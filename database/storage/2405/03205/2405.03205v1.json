However, these models exhibit a positional\nbias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they\nconsistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This\nanchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as\nit skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the\nchoices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability\napproach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for\nthis bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention\nheads, using the \"logit lens\" method to trace and modify the specific value\nvectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and\nrecalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first\nchoice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not\nonly correct the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for\nthe GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first\ncomprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias in MCQs within the GPT-2\nmodels, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that\nsignificantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

'Variety' is one of the\nparameters by which one can quantify the breadth of a concept space explored by\nthe designers. It is useful to assess variety at the conceptual design stage\nbecause, at this stage, designers have the freedom to explore different\nsolution principles so as to satisfy a design problem with substantially novel\nconcepts. This article elaborates on and critically examines the existing\nvariety metrics from the engineering design literature, discussing their\nlimitations. A new distance-based variety metric is proposed, along with a\nprescriptive framework to support the assessment process. This framework uses\nthe SAPPhIRE model of causality as a knowledge representation scheme to measure\nthe real-valued distance between two design concepts. The proposed framework is\nimplemented in a software tool called 'VariAnT.' Furthermore, the tool's\napplication is demonstrated through an illustrative example.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c07\u8a2d\u8a08\u5275\u610f\u8207\u300c\u767c\u6563\u6027\u601d\u8003\u300d\u806f\u7e6b\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u4ea6\u5373\u5728\u8a2d\u8a08\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u9593\u63a2\u7d22\u5f97\u6709\u591a\u597d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u4e3b\u5f35\uff0c\u7522\u751f\u591a\u500b\u6982\u5ff5\u5c07\u589e\u52a0\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u8a2d\u8a08\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u300c\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u300d\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u500b\u53c3\u6578\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4eba\u54e1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f86\u91cf\u5316\u4ed6\u5011\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u9593\u5ee3\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u8a2d\u8a08\u968e\u6bb5\u8a55\u4f30\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u5f88\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5728\u9019\u500b\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4eba\u54e1\u6709\u81ea\u7531\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u539f\u5247\uff0c\u4ee5\u6eff\u8db3\u5be6\u8cea\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u7a4e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u554f\u984c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8a73\u7d30\u8aaa\u660e\u4e26\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u5be9\u67e5\u5de5\u7a0b\u8a2d\u8a08\u6587\u737b\u4e2d\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4e26\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u8ddd\u96e2\u7684\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u500b\u898f\u7bc4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4f86\u652f\u6301\u8a55\u4f30\u904e\u7a0b\u3002\u9019\u500b\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528 SAPPhIRE \u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u70ba\u77e5\u8b58\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f86\u6e2c\u91cf\u5169\u500b\u8a2d\u8a08\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5be6\u503c\u8ddd\u96e2\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7a31\u70ba\u300cVariAnT\u300d\u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u5be6\u4f5c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u8aaa\u660e\u6027\u7bc4\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8a72\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u3002", "author": "Anubhab Majumder et.al.", "authors": "Anubhab Majumder, Ujjwal Pal, Amaresh Chakrabarti", "id": "2408.00684v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00684v1", "repo": "null"}}

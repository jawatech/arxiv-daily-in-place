{"2501.12537": {"publish_time": "2025-01-21", "title": "Enhancing Privacy in the Early Detection of Sexual Predators Through Federated Learning and Differential Privacy", "paper_summary": "The increased screen time and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have\nled to a significant surge in cases of online grooming, which is the use of\nstrategies by predators to lure children into sexual exploitation. Previous\nefforts to detect grooming in industry and academia have involved accessing and\nmonitoring private conversations through centrally-trained models or sending\nprivate conversations to a global server. In this work, we implement a\nprivacy-preserving pipeline for the early detection of sexual predators. We\nleverage federated learning and differential privacy in order to create safer\nonline spaces for children while respecting their privacy. We investigate\nvarious privacy-preserving implementations and discuss their benefits and\nshortcomings. Our extensive evaluation using real-world data proves that\nprivacy and utility can coexist with only a slight reduction in utility.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7531\u65bc COVID-19 \u75ab\u60c5\u5c0e\u81f4\u87a2\u5e55\u6642\u9593\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u9694\u96e2\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u7db2\u8def\u8a98\u9a19\u6848\u4ef6\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7db2\u8def\u8a98\u9a19\u662f\u6307\u63a0\u596a\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8a98\u5152\u7ae5\u9032\u884c\u6027\u525d\u524a\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7522\u696d\u548c\u5b78\u8853\u754c\u5075\u6e2c\u8a98\u9a19\u7684\u4f5c\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u900f\u904e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u53d6\u548c\u76e3\u63a7\u79c1\u4eba\u5c0d\u8a71\uff0c\u6216\u5c07\u79c1\u4eba\u5c0d\u8a71\u50b3\u9001\u81f3\u5168\u7403\u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e00\u500b\u6ce8\u91cd\u96b1\u79c1\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u65e9\u671f\u5075\u6e2c\u6027\u63a0\u596a\u8005\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u806f\u76df\u5f0f\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u96b1\u79c1\uff0c\u5728\u5c0a\u91cd\u5152\u7ae5\u96b1\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u70ba\u4ed6\u5011\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u7a7a\u9593\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u5404\u7a2e\u6ce8\u91cd\u96b1\u79c1\u7684\u5be6\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u5176\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u7f3a\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u800c\u6548\u7528\u53ea\u6703\u7565\u5fae\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "author": "Khaoula Chehbouni et.al.", "authors": "Khaoula Chehbouni, Martine De Cock, Gilles Caporossi, Afaf Taik, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi", "id": "2501.12537v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12537v1", "repo": "null"}}

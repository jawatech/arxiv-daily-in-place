We can regard that as a\ncomplex adaptive system consisting of many artificial neurons that work as an\nadaptive memory as a whole. The network's behavior is training dynamics with a\nfeedback loop from the evaluation of the loss function. We already know the\ntraining response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal\nsituations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other\ncomplex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very\nsimple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some\ndifferent factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training\nmethods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of\nstochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally,\nwe discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u500b\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u64ec\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u8f38\u5165\u8207\u8f38\u51fa\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u5176\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u8907\u96dc\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u7531\u8a31\u591a\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u7d44\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u795e\u7d93\u5143\u6574\u9ad4\u4e0a\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u9069\u61c9\u8a18\u61b6\u9ad4\u904b\u4f5c\u3002\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u662f\u900f\u904e\u640d\u5931\u51fd\u6578\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u56de\u994b\u8ff4\u8def\u9032\u884c\u8a13\u7df4\u52d5\u614b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u7d93\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u53cd\u61c9\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u5e38\u6578\uff0c\u6216\u986f\u793a\u985e\u4f3c\u51aa\u5f8b\u7684\u8001\u5316\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u8907\u96dc\u73fe\u8c61\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7db2\u8def\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u586b\u88dc\u9019\u500b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u975e\u5e38\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u4e26\u5c0d\u5176\u9032\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8a13\u7df4\u53cd\u61c9\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4\u968e\u6bb5\u3001\u555f\u7528\u51fd\u6578\u6216\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5fb5\u7a7a\u9593\u7c21\u7d04\u5316\u4f5c\u70ba\u96a8\u6a5f\u8a13\u7df4\u52d5\u614b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u7db2\u8def\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8907\u96dc\u73fe\u8c61\u3002", "author": "Kenichi Nakazato et.al.", "authors": "Kenichi Nakazato", "id": "2405.04074v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04074v1", "repo": "null"}}

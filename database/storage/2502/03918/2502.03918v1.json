A robot could use this to observe the execution of a task\nand target a different goal from the observed one; a goal that is still\ncompatible with the task description but would be easier for the robot to\nexecute. We define the model of an environment state and an environment\nvariation, and present experiments on how to interactively create the variation\nfrom a single task demonstration and how to use this variation to create an\nexecution plan for bringing any environment into the goal state.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e00\u500b\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u6a19\u72c0\u614b\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8b8a\u6027\u3002\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u67b6\u69cb\u4f86\u89c0\u5bdf\u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u4e26\u91dd\u5c0d\u8207\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\uff1b\u4e00\u500b\u4ecd\u7136\u8207\u4efb\u52d9\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f8\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0d\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u57f7\u884c\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u74b0\u5883\u72c0\u614b\u548c\u74b0\u5883\u8b8a\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5f9e\u55ae\u4e00\u4efb\u52d9\u793a\u7bc4\u4e2d\u4e92\u52d5\u5f0f\u5730\u5275\u5efa\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u8b8a\u5316\u70ba\u5c07\u4efb\u4f55\u74b0\u5883\u5e36\u5165\u76ee\u6a19\u72c0\u614b\u5275\u5efa\u57f7\u884c\u8a08\u756b\u3002", "author": "Andrei Costinescu et.al.", "authors": "Andrei Costinescu, Darius Burschka", "id": "2502.03918v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03918v1", "repo": "null"}}

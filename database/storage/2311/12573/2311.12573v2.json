These model marketplaces lower technical deployment barriers\nfor hundreds of thousands of users, yet can be used in numerous potentially\nharmful and illegal ways. In this article, we explain ways in which AI systems,\nwhich can both `contain' content and be open-ended tools, present one of the\ntrickiest platform governance challenges seen to date. We provide case studies\nof several incidents across three illustrative platforms -- Hugging Face,\nGitHub and Civitai -- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models.\nBuilding on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited)\npractices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands:\nlicensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open\npolicy development. While the policy challenge at hand is a considerable one,\nwe conclude with some ideas as to how platforms could better mobilize resources\nto act as a careful, fair, and proportionate regulatory access point.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Robert Gorwa et.al.", "authors": "Robert Gorwa,Michael Veale", "id": "2311.12573v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12573v2", "repo": "null"}}

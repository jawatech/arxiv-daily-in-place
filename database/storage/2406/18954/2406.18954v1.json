It examines\ntraditional training approaches such as instruction fine-tuning and the recent\nadvancements in direct alignment methods like Identity Preference Optimization\n(IPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). The effectiveness of alignment\ntechniques both pre and post-instruction tuning is highlighted, illustrating\ntheir potential to optimize conversational bots in domains that require strict\nadherence to specified rules, such as customer care.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5c0d\u8a71\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u4e5f\u7a31\u70ba\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8207\u55ae\u7368\u5c0d\u6307\u4ee4\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c0d\u9f4a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u5c0d\u9632\u8b77\u6b04\u7684\u66f4\u4f73\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u6e96\u5247\u6216\u300c\u9632\u8b77\u6b04\u300d\u4e2d\u3002\u5b83\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8abf\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c0d\u9f4a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8eab\u5206\u504f\u597d\u6700\u4f73\u5316 (IPO) \u548c Kahneman-Tversky \u6700\u4f73\u5316 (KTO)\u3002\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u5c0d\u9f4a\u6280\u8853\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8abf\u6574\u524d\u5f8c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u9700\u8981\u56b4\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u7279\u5b9a\u898f\u5247\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5ba2\u6236\u670d\u52d9\uff09\u7684\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u5c0d\u8a71\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002", "author": "Raghav Garg et.al.", "authors": "Raghav Garg, Kapil Sharma, Shrey Singla", "id": "2406.18954v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18954v1", "repo": "null"}}

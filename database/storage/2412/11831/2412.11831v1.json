Exploring the Use of Model Uncertainty for Question Difficulty Estimation", "paper_summary": "In an educational setting, an estimate of the difficulty of multiple-choice\nquestions (MCQs), a commonly used strategy to assess learning progress,\nconstitutes very useful information for both teachers and students. Since human\nassessment is costly from multiple points of view, automatic approaches to MCQ\nitem difficulty estimation are investigated, yielding however mixed success\nuntil now. Our approach to this problem takes a different angle from previous\nwork: asking various Large Language Models to tackle the questions included in\ntwo different MCQ datasets, we leverage model uncertainty to estimate item\ndifficulty. By using both model uncertainty features as well as textual\nfeatures in a Random Forest regressor, we show that uncertainty features\ncontribute substantially to difficulty prediction, where difficulty is\ninversely proportional to the number of students who can correctly answer a\nquestion. In addition to showing the value of our approach, we also observe\nthat our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEA publicly available\ndataset.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u9078\u984c (MCQ) \u7684\u96e3\u5ea6\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u666e\u904d\u7528\u65bc\u8a55\u91cf\u5b78\u7fd2\u9032\u5ea6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c0d\u8001\u5e2b\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u800c\u8a00\u90fd\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7528\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u4eba\u5de5\u8a55\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c0d\u65bc MCQ \u984c\u76ee\u96e3\u5ea6\u8a55\u4f30\u7684\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u70ba\u6b62\u6536\u6548\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u6b64\u554f\u984c\u63a1\u53d6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8207\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff1a\u8981\u6c42\u5404\u7a2e\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u8655\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5728\u5169\u500b\u4e0d\u540c MCQ \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u984c\u76ee\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u984c\u76ee\u96e3\u5ea6\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5728\u96a8\u6a5f\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u6b78\u5668\u4e2d\u540c\u6642\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u548c\u6587\u5b57\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5fb5\u5c0d\u96e3\u5ea6\u9810\u6e2c\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u96e3\u5ea6\u8207\u80fd\u6b63\u78ba\u56de\u7b54\u554f\u984c\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u4eba\u6578\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u986f\u793a\u6211\u5011\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 BEA \u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "author": "Leonidas Zotos et.al.", "authors": "Leonidas Zotos, Hedderik van Rijn, Malvina Nissim", "id": "2412.11831v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11831v1", "repo": "null"}}

Traditional monitoring methods often rely on fixed thresholds and\nempirical rules, which may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in\nsystem health and predict impending failures. To address this limitation, this\npaper proposes, a novel Attention-based convolutional autoencoder (ABCD) for\nrisk detection and map the risk value derive to the maintenance planning. ABCD\nlearns the normal behavior of conductivity from historical data of a real-world\nindustrial cooling system and reconstructs the input data, identifying\nanomalies that deviate from the expected patterns. The framework also employs\ncalibration techniques to ensure the reliability of its predictions. Evaluation\nresults demonstrate that with the attention mechanism in ABCD a 57.4% increase\nin performance and a reduction of false alarms by 9.37% is seen compared to\nwithout attention. The approach can effectively detect risks, the risk priority\nrank mapped to maintenance, providing valuable insights for cooling system\ndesigners and service personnel. Calibration error of 0.03% indicates that the\nmodel is well-calibrated and enhances model's trustworthiness, enabling\ninformed decisions about maintenance strategies", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Sarala Naidu et.al.", "authors": "Sarala Naidu,Ning Xiong", "id": "2404.16183v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16183v1", "repo": "null"}}

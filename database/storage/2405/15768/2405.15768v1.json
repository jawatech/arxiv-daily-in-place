We employ the\nWasserstein metric to measure distances between distributions, which are then\nused by distance-based classification algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors,\nk-means, and pseudo-mixture modeling. Central to our investigation is dimension\nreduction within the Wasserstein metric space to enhance classification\naccuracy. We introduce a novel approach grounded in the principle of maximizing\nFisher's ratio, defined as the quotient of between-class variation to\nwithin-class variation. The directions in which this ratio is maximized are\ntermed discriminant coordinates or canonical variates axes. In practice, we\ndefine both between-class and within-class variations as the average squared\ndistances between pairs of instances, with the pairs either belonging to the\nsame class or to different classes. This ratio optimization is achieved through\nan iterative algorithm, which alternates between optimal transport and\nmaximization steps within the vector space. We conduct empirical studies to\nassess the algorithm's convergence and, through experimental validation,\ndemonstrate that our dimension reduction technique substantially enhances\nclassification performance. Moreover, our method outperforms well-established\nalgorithms that operate on vector representations derived from distributional\ndata. It also exhibits robustness against variations in the distributional\nrepresentations of data clouds.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6bcf\u500b\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u5be6\u4f8b\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u4e26\u975e\u55ae\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u4f48\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528 Wasserstein \u5ea6\u91cf\u4f86\u6e2c\u91cf\u5206\u4f48\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u7531\u57fa\u65bc\u8ddd\u96e2\u7684\u5206\u985e\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 k-\u6700\u8fd1\u9130\u5c45\u3001k-means \u548c\u507d\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u4e9b\u8ddd\u96e2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8abf\u67e5\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u662f Wasserstein \u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u7684\u964d\u7dad\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u985e\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u790e\u662f\u6700\u5927\u5316 Fisher \u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u985e\u9593\u8b8a\u7570\u8207\u985e\u5167\u8b8a\u7570\u7684\u5546\u3002\u6b64\u6bd4\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7a31\u70ba\u5224\u5225\u5750\u6a19\u6216\u5178\u578b\u8b8a\u7570\u8ef8\u3002\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u985e\u9593\u8b8a\u7570\u548c\u985e\u5167\u8b8a\u7570\u5b9a\u7fa9\u70ba\u5be6\u4f8b\u5c0d\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u65b9\u8ddd\u96e2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9019\u4e9b\u5c0d\u5c6c\u65bc\u540c\u4e00\u500b\u985e\u5225\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u985e\u5225\u3002\u6b64\u6bd4\u7387\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u662f\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u53cd\u8986\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f86\u5be6\u73fe\u7684\uff0c\u6b64\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u4ea4\u66ff\u9032\u884c\u6700\u4f73\u50b3\u8f38\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6b65\u9a5f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u5be6\u8b49\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u6582\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u9a57\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u6211\u5011\u7684\u964d\u7dad\u6280\u8853\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u985e\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u904b\u4f5c\u5728\u5f9e\u5206\u4f48\u5f0f\u8cc7\u6599\u884d\u751f\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u65e2\u6709\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u4e5f\u5c0d\u8cc7\u6599\u96f2\u7684\u5206\u4f48\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u8b8a\u7570\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Jia Li et.al.", "authors": "Jia Li, Lin Lin", "id": "2405.15768v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15768v1", "repo": "null"}}

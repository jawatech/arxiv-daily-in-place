To confidently enable a real-world, decision-making system to\nutilize such a perception model without human intervention, we must enable the\nsystem to reason about the perception model's level of competency and respond\nappropriately when the model is incompetent. In order for the system to make an\nintelligent decision about the appropriate action when the model is\nincompetent, it would be useful for the system to understand why the model is\nincompetent. We explore five novel methods for identifying regions in the input\nimage contributing to low model competency, which we refer to as image\ncropping, segment masking, pixel perturbation, competency gradients, and\nreconstruction loss. We assess the ability of these five methods to identify\nunfamiliar objects, recognize regions associated with unseen classes, and\nidentify unexplored areas in an environment. We find that the competency\ngradients and reconstruction loss methods show great promise in identifying\nregions associated with low model competency, particularly when aspects of the\nimage that are unfamiliar to the perception model are causing this reduction in\ncompetency. Both of these methods boast low computation times and high levels\nof accuracy in detecting image regions that are unfamiliar to the model,\nallowing them to provide potential utility in decision-making pipelines.

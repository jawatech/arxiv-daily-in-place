However, LMs may learn personal and confidential information\nfrom the training data, leading to privacy concerns such as data leakage.\nTherefore, research on knowledge deletion from LMs is essential. This study\nfocuses on the knowledge stored in LMs and analyzes the relationship between\nthe side effects of knowledge deletion and the entities related to the\nknowledge. Our findings reveal that deleting knowledge related to popular\nentities can have catastrophic side effects. Furthermore, this research is the\nfirst to analyze knowledge deletion in models trained on synthetic knowledge\ngraphs, indicating a new direction for controlled experiments.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LM) \u900f\u904e\u8a13\u7df4\u5c07\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8b58\u7de8\u78bc\u5728\u5176\u5167\u90e8\u53c3\u6578\u4e2d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLM \u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5f9e\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u500b\u4eba\u548c\u6a5f\u5bc6\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u8cc7\u6599\u5916\u6d29\u7b49\u96b1\u79c1\u554f\u984c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f9e LM \u4e2d\u522a\u9664\u77e5\u8b58\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u5132\u5b58\u5728 LM \u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8b58\u522a\u9664\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u8207\u8207\u77e5\u8b58\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5be6\u9ad4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u522a\u9664\u8207\u71b1\u9580\u5be6\u9ad4\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u9020\u6210\u707d\u96e3\u6027\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5408\u6210\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4e0a\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u522a\u9664\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u53d7\u63a7\u5be6\u9a57\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Ryosuke Takahashi et.al.", "authors": "Ryosuke Takahashi, Go Kamoda, Benjamin Heinzerling, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui", "id": "2406.06032v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06032v1", "repo": "null"}}

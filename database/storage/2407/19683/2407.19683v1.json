However, different\npost-hoc interpretability methods often provide different results, casting\ndoubts on their accuracy. For this reason, several evaluation strategies have\nbeen proposed to understand the accuracy of post-hoc interpretability. Many of\nthese evaluation strategies provide a coarse-grained assessment -- i.e., they\nevaluate how the performance of the model degrades on average by corrupting\ndifferent data points across multiple samples. While these strategies are\neffective in selecting the post-hoc interpretability method that is most\nreliable on average, they fail to provide a sample-level, also referred to as\nfine-grained, assessment. In other words, they do not measure the robustness of\npost-hoc interpretability methods. We propose an approach and two new metrics\nto provide a fine-grained assessment of post-hoc interpretability methods. We\nshow that the robustness is generally linked to its coarse-grained performance.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (XAI) \u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u95dc\u9375\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u6703\u627e\u51fa\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u505a\u6c7a\u7b56\u6642\u8996\u70ba\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6703\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u8b93\u4eba\u8cea\u7591\u5176\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7a2e\u8a55\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4f86\u4e86\u89e3\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u9019\u4e9b\u8a55\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7834\u58de\u591a\u500b\u6a23\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8cc7\u6599\u9ede\u6642\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u9019\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9078\u64c7\u5e73\u5747\u800c\u8a00\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6642\u5f88\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a23\u672c\u5c64\u7d1a\uff08\u4e5f\u7a31\u70ba\u7d30\u7dfb\uff09\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u63db\u53e5\u8a71\u8aaa\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5169\u500b\u65b0\u6307\u6a19\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8b\u5f8c\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7d30\u7dfb\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8b49\u660e\uff0c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u8207\u5176\u7c97\u7565\u6548\u80fd\u6709\u95dc\u3002", "author": "Jiawen Wei et.al.", "authors": "Jiawen Wei, Hugues Turb\u00e9, Gianmarco Mengaldo", "id": "2407.19683v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19683v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2405.12084": {"publish_time": "2024-05-20", "title": "Distributional Semantics, Holism, and the Instability of Meaning", "paper_summary": "Current language models are built on the so-called distributional semantic\napproach to linguistic meaning that has the distributional hypothesis at its\ncore. The distributional hypothesis involves a holistic conception of word\nmeaning: the meaning of a word depends upon its relations to other words in the\nmodel. A standard objection to meaning holism is the charge of instability: any\nchange in the meaning properties of a linguistic system (a human speaker, for\nexample) would lead to many changes or possibly a complete change in the entire\nsystem. When the systems in question are trying to communicate with each other,\nit has been argued that instability of this kind makes communication impossible\n(Fodor and Lepore 1992, 1996, 1999). In this article, we examine whether the\ninstability objection poses a problem for distributional models of meaning.\nFirst, we distinguish between distinct forms of instability that these models\ncould exhibit, and we argue that only one such form is relevant for\nunderstanding the relation between instability and communication: what we call\ndifferential instability. Differential instability is variation in the relative\ndistances between points in a space, rather than variation in the absolute\nposition of those points. We distinguish differential and absolute instability\nby constructing two of our own models, a toy model constructed from the text of\ntwo novels, and a more sophisticated model constructed using the Word2vec\nalgorithm from a combination of Wikipedia and SEP articles. We demonstrate the\ntwo forms of instability by showing how these models change as the corpora they\nare constructed from increase in size.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7576\u524d\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u6240\u8b02\u7684\u5206\u914d\u8a9e\u7fa9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a9e\u8a00\u610f\u7fa9\u70ba\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u5047\u8a2d\u70ba\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u3002\u5206\u914d\u5047\u8a2d\u6d89\u53ca\u55ae\u8a5e\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u6982\u5ff5\uff1a\u55ae\u8a5e\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u5b83\u8207\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u55ae\u8a5e\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u5c0d\u610f\u7fa9\u6574\u9ad4\u8ad6\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u53cd\u5c0d\u610f\u898b\u662f\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6307\u63a7\uff1a\u8a9e\u8a00\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u985e\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\uff09\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u5c6c\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u8b8a\u5316\u90fd\u6703\u5c0e\u81f4\u8a31\u591a\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0e\u81f4\u6574\u500b\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u7576\u6709\u554f\u984c\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u5617\u8a66\u76f8\u4e92\u901a\u4fe1\u6642\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u8a8d\u70ba\u9019\u7a2e\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u4fe1\u8b8a\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\uff08Fodor and Lepore 1992, 1996, 1999\uff09\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u5c0d\u610f\u898b\u662f\u5426\u5c0d\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u69cb\u6210\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5340\u5206\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u7a2e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8207\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u76f8\u95dc\uff1a\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u5dee\u7570\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5dee\u7570\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u7a7a\u9593\u4e2d\u5404\u9ede\u4e4b\u9593\u76f8\u5c0d\u8ddd\u96e2\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u9019\u4e9b\u9ede\u7d55\u5c0d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u69cb\u5efa\u6211\u5011\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5169\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u5340\u5206\u5dee\u7570\u548c\u7d55\u5c0d\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u5169\u90e8\u5c0f\u8aaa\u7684\u6587\u672c\u69cb\u5efa\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7dfb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7531 Word2vec \u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7dad\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u548c SEP \u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u69cb\u5efa\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u5c55\u793a\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u96a8\u8457\u69cb\u5efa\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u8a9e\u6599\u5eab\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6539\u8b8a\uff0c\u4f86\u8b49\u660e\u9019\u5169\u7a2e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "author": "Jumbly Grindrod et.al.", "authors": "Jumbly Grindrod, J.

In this paper, we investigate if NLI tasks,\nthat are rarely used for LLM evaluation, can still be informative for\nevaluating LLMs. Focusing on five different NLI benchmarks across six models of\ndifferent scales, we investigate if they are able to discriminate models of\ndifferent size and quality and how their accuracies develop during training.\nFurthermore, we investigate the extent to which the softmax distributions of\nmodels align with human distributions in cases where statements are ambiguous\nor vague. Overall, our results paint a positive picture for the NLI tasks: we\nfind that they are able to discriminate well between models at various stages\nof training, yet are not (all) saturated. Furthermore, we find that while the\nsimilarity of model distributions with human label distributions increases with\nscale, it is still much higher than the similarity between two populations of\nhumans, making it a potentially interesting statistic to consider.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5728\u4e0d\u4e45\u7684\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u8a55\u4f30\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u7406\u89e3 (NLU) \u7684\u4e00\u7a2e\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u8003\u616e\u6a21\u578b\u57f7\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u63a8\u7406 (NLI) \u4efb\u52d9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5f88\u5c11\u7528\u65bc LLM \u8a55\u4f30\u7684 NLI \u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u70ba\u8a55\u4f30 LLM \u63d0\u4f9b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u516d\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u898f\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 NLI \u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u63a2\u8a0e\u5b83\u5011\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5920\u5340\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u54c1\u8cea\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5728\u8a9e\u53e5\u6a21\u7a1c\u5169\u53ef\u6216\u542b\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684 softmax \u5206\u5e03\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u70ba NLI \u4efb\u52d9\u63cf\u7e6a\u4e86\u4e00\u5e45\u6b63\u9762\u7684\u5716\u50cf\uff1a\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u5b83\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5340\u5206\u8a13\u7df4\u4e0d\u540c\u968e\u6bb5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e26\u672a\uff08\u5168\u90e8\uff09\u98fd\u548c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u767c\u73fe\u96d6\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u6a19\u7c64\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u96a8\u8457\u898f\u6a21\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ecd\u7136\u9060\u9ad8\u65bc\u5169\u500b\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u9019\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u503c\u5f97\u8003\u616e\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u6709\u8da3\u7d71\u8a08\u6578\u64da\u3002", "author": "Lovish Madaan et.al.", "authors": "Lovish Madaan, David Esiobu, Pontus Stenetorp, Barbara Plank, Dieuwke Hupkes", "id": "2411.14103v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14103v1", "repo": "null"}}

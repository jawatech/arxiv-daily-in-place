While LLMs have achieved success in various\ntasks, they face numerous security and privacy threats, which become even more\nsevere in the agent scenarios. To enhance the reliability of LLM-based\napplications, a range of research has emerged to assess and mitigate these\nrisks from different perspectives.\n  To help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of various risks, this\nsurvey collects and analyzes the different threats faced by these agents. To\naddress the challenges posed by previous taxonomies in handling cross-module\nand cross-stage threats, we propose a novel taxonomy framework based on the\nsources and impacts. Additionally, we identify six key features of LLM-based\nagents, based on which we summarize the current research progress and analyze\ntheir limitations. Subsequently, we select four representative agents as case\nstudies to analyze the risks they may face in practical use. Finally, based on\nthe aforementioned analyses, we propose future research directions from the\nperspectives of data, methodology, and policy, respectively.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u7684\u6301\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\n\u57fa\u65bc Transformer \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u773e\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406 (NLP) \u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u7684\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u4f5c\u70ba\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e3b\u9ad4\u51fa\u73fe\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 LLM \u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5011\u9762\u81e8\u8457\u773e\u591a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u96b1\u79c1\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u9ad4\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u8b8a\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u56b4\u91cd\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u589e\u5f37\u57fa\u65bc LLM \u7684\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u4f86\u8a55\u4f30\u548c\u6e1b\u8f15\u9019\u4e9b\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f86\u770b\u3002\n\u70ba\u4e86\u5e6b\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u5404\u7a2e\u98a8\u96aa\uff0c\u672c\u8abf\u67e5\u6536\u96c6\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u4e3b\u9ad4\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u8105\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u61c9\u5c0d\u5148\u524d\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u5728\u8655\u7406\u8de8\u6a21\u7d44\u548c\u8de8\u968e\u6bb5\u5a01\u8105\u6642\u6240\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u57fa\u65bc\u4f86\u6e90\u548c\u5f71\u97ff\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da LLM \u57fa\u65bc\u4e3b\u9ad4\u7684\u516d\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u7279\u5fb5\uff0c\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e86\u7576\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9032\u5c55\u4e26\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9078\u64c7\u4e86\u56db\u500b\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u9ad4\u4f5c\u70ba\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5be6\u969b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5206\u5225\u5f9e\u8cc7\u6599\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "author": "Yuyou Gan et.al.", "authors": "Yuyou Gan, Yong Yang, Zhe Ma, Ping He, Rui Zeng, Yiming Wang, Qingming Li, Chunyi Zhou, Songze Li, Ting Wang, Yunjun Gao, Yingcai Wu, Shouling Ji", "id": "2411.09523v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09523v1", "repo": "null"}}

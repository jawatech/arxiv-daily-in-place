This framework is\ndifferent from the current advanced models that use discrete data augmentation\nmethods, but instead reshapes the input features of the original sentence,\naggregates the global information of each token in the sentence, and alleviates\nthe common problems of representation polarity and GPU memory consumption\nlinear increase in current advanced models. In addition, our reCSE has achieved\ncompetitive performance in semantic similarity tasks. And the experiment proves\nthat our proposed feature reshaping method has strong universality, which can\nbe transplanted to other self supervised contrastive learning frameworks and\nenhance their representation ability, even achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Existing vision models for\ndefect recognition methods are insufficient for handling the complexities and\nvariations of defects in contemporary manufacturing settings. These models\nespecially struggle in scenarios involving limited or imbalanced defect data.\nIn this work, we introduce MemoryMamba, a novel memory-augmented state space\nmodel (SSM), designed to overcome the limitations of existing defect\nrecognition models. MemoryMamba integrates the state space model with the\nmemory augmentation mechanism, enabling the system to maintain and retrieve\nessential defect-specific information in training. Its architecture is designed\nto capture dependencies and intricate defect characteristics, which are crucial\nfor effective defect detection. In the experiments, MemoryMamba was evaluated\nacross four industrial datasets with diverse defect types and complexities. The\nmodel consistently outperformed other methods, demonstrating its capability to\nadapt to various defect recognition scenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Qianning Wang et.al.", "authors": "Qianning Wang,He Hu,Yucheng Zhou", "id": "2405.03673v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03673v1", "repo": "null"}}

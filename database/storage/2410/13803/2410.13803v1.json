In\nthis paper, we propose a novel ontology design pattern that captures the\nseparation of concerns between an entity (and the information it conveys),\nwhose semantics can have different manifestations across different media, and\nits realisation in terms of a physical information entity. By introducing this\nabstract model, we aim to facilitate the harmonisation and integration of\ndifferent existing multi-modal ontologies which is crucial for many intelligent\napplications across different domains spanning from medicine to digital\nhumanities.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u5b98\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u652f\u6490\u4eba\u985e\u667a\u6167\u7684\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u4e2d\u5c0d\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5efa\u6a21\u8208\u8da3\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u9577\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u85c9\u7531\u5c07\u5be6\u9ad4\u8207\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u614b\u8868\u5fb5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u5b57\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u8a0a\u548c\u5f71\u7247\uff09\u95dc\u806f\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u64f4\u5145\u4e86\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u8868\u5fb5\u5168\u90e8\u7528\u65bc\u50b3\u9054\u5be6\u9ad4\u7684\u8a9e\u610f\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u77e5\u8b58\u5716\u8b5c\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u614b\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8b58\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u614b\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u61c9\u7528\u9818\u57df\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8a2d\u8a08\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u6355\u7372\u4e86\u5be6\u9ad4\uff08\u53ca\u5176\u50b3\u9054\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff09\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\u9ede\u5206\u96e2\uff0c\u5176\u8a9e\u610f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e2d\u5448\u73fe\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5be6\u9ad4\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5be6\u9ad4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5be6\u73fe\u3002\u85c9\u7531\u5c0e\u5165\u9019\u500b\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u9032\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u614b\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u548c\u8ae7\u5316\u548c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u65bc\u8de8\u8d8a\u5f9e\u91ab\u5b78\u5230\u6578\u4f4d\u4eba\u6587\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8a31\u591a\u667a\u6167\u61c9\u7528\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "author": "Gianluca Apriceno et.al.", "authors": "Gianluca Apriceno, Valentina Tamma, Tania Bailoni, Jacopo de Berardinis, Mauro Dragoni", "id": "2410.13803v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13803v1", "repo": "https://github.com/ida-fbk/multimodalpattern"}}

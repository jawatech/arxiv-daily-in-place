{"2502.09609": {"publish_time": "2025-02-13", "title": "Score-of-Mixture Training: Training One-Step Generative Models Made Simple", "paper_summary": "We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training\none-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the\n$\\alpha$-skew Jensen-Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score\nof mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise\nlevels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from\nscratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we\ncall Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires\nminimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even\noutperform existing methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u8a55\u5206\u8a13\u7df4 (SMT)\uff0c\u4e00\u7a2e\u900f\u904e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a31\u70ba $\\alpha$-\u504f\u659c Jensen-Shannon \u8ddd\u96e2\u7684\u8ddd\u96e2\u985e\u5225\u4f86\u8a13\u7df4\u55ae\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff0cSMT \u4f30\u8a08\u771f\u5be6\u548c\u865b\u5047\u6a23\u672c\u4e4b\u9593\u5728\u591a\u500b\u96dc\u8a0a\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u914d\u8a55\u5206\u3002\u8207\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u985e\u4f3c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u652f\u63f4\u5f9e\u982d\u958b\u59cb\u8a13\u7df4 (SMT) \u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u9810\u5148\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u64f4\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u84b8\u993e\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7a31\u4e4b\u70ba\u6df7\u5408\u8a55\u5206\u84b8\u993e (SMD)\u3002\u5b83\u6613\u65bc\u5be6\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8d85\u53c3\u6578\u8abf\u6574\uff0c\u4e26\u78ba\u4fdd\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u548c ImageNet 64x64 \u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u986f\u793a\uff0cSMT/SMD \u5177\u6709\u7af6\u722d\u529b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Tejas Jayashankar et.al.", "authors": "Tejas Jayashankar, J.

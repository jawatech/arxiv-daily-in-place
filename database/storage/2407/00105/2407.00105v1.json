As the use of medications continues to rise, so does the\nimportance of understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with\nthem. At present, researchers have turned to data-driven methods to predict\ndrug-side effects. Drug-side effect prediction is a link prediction problem,\nand the related data can be described from various perspectives. To process\nthese kinds of data, a multi-view method, called Multiple Kronecker RLS\nfusion-based link propagation (MKronRLSF-LP), is proposed. MKronRLSF-LP extends\nthe Kron-RLS by finding the consensus partitions and multiple graph Laplacian\nconstraints in the multi-view setting. Both of these multi-view settings\ncontribute to a higher quality result. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on drug-side effect datasets, and our empirical results provide\nevidence that our approach is effective and robust.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u85e5\u7269\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u9810\u6e2c\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u85e5\u7406\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u9ede\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u85e5\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u7e8c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u6e1b\u8f15\u8207\u85e5\u7269\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6f5b\u5728\u98a8\u96aa\u4e5f\u8b8a\u5f97\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5df2\u8f49\u5411\u8cc7\u6599\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c\u85e5\u7269\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u85e5\u7269\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u9810\u6e2c\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u9023\u7d50\u9810\u6e2c\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u6599\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f86\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8655\u7406\u9019\u4e9b\u985e\u578b\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a31\u70ba\u591a\u91cd Kronecker RLS \u878d\u5408\u5f0f\u9023\u7d50\u50b3\u64ad (MKronRLSF-LP) \u7684\u591a\u8996\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002MKronRLSF-LP \u900f\u904e\u5728\u591a\u8996\u89d2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u5171\u8b58\u5206\u5272\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u5716\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7d04\u675f\uff0c\u4f86\u5ef6\u4f38 Kron-RLS\u3002\u9019\u5169\u500b\u591a\u8996\u89d2\u8a2d\u5b9a\u90fd\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63d0\u5347\u7d50\u679c\u54c1\u8cea\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5df2\u5728\u85e5\u7269\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u8b49\u7d50\u679c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5f37\u5065\u3002", "author": "Yuqing Qian et.al.", "authors": "Yuqing Qian, Ziyu Zheng, Prayag Tiwari, Yijie Ding, Quan Zou", "id": "2407.00105v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00105v1", "repo": "null"}}

A key challenge is developing intuitive\ninterfaces for easy communication. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\nGPT-4 has enhanced robot capabilities, allowing for real-time interaction and\ndecision-making. This integration improves robots' adaptability and\nfunctionality. This project focuses on merging LLMs with databases to improve\ndecision-making and enable knowledge acquisition for request interpretation\nproblems.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\u65bc\u5de5\u696d\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u8b77\u7406\u4e4b\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u5354\u52a9\u54e1\u5de5\u3002\u4e00\u9805\u95dc\u9375\u6311\u6230\u662f\u958b\u767c\u76f4\u89ba\u5f0f\u4ecb\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8f15\u9b06\u6e9d\u901a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM)\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 GPT-4\uff0c\u589e\u5f37\u4e86\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5141\u8a31\u5373\u6642\u4e92\u52d5\u548c\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002\u6b64\u6574\u5408\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5c08\u6848\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5c07 LLM \u8207\u8cc7\u6599\u5eab\u5408\u4f75\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u8b93\u77e5\u8b58\u64f7\u53d6\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u8acb\u6c42\u8a6e\u91cb\u554f\u984c\u3002", "author": "Stanislau Stankevich et.al.", "authors": "Stanislau Stankevich, Wojciech Dudek", "id": "2407.21512v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21512v1", "repo": "null"}}

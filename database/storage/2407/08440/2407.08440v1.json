This demands the possession of rule-following capability of LLMs.\nHowever, few works have made a clear evaluation of the rule-following\ncapability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the rule-following\ncapability of LLMs fail to distinguish the rule-following scenarios from the\ninstruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first makes a\nclarification of the concept of rule-following, and curates a comprehensive\nbenchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of rule-following\nabilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are\nstill limited in following rules. Our further analysis provides insights into\nthe improvements for LLMs toward a better rule-following intelligent agent.

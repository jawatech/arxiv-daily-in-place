However, its potential is not fully\nexploited because the widely-used joint training strategy, which has a uniform\nobjective for all modalities, leads to imbalanced and under-optimized uni-modal\nrepresentations. Specifically, we point out that there often exists modality\nwith more discriminative information, e.g., vision of playing football and\nsound of blowing wind. They could dominate the joint training process,\nresulting in other modalities being significantly under-optimized. To alleviate\nthis problem, we first analyze the under-optimized phenomenon from both the\nfeed-forward and the back-propagation stages during optimization. Then,\nOn-the-fly Prediction Modulation (OPM) and On-the-fly Gradient Modulation (OGM)\nstrategies are proposed to modulate the optimization of each modality, by\nmonitoring the discriminative discrepancy between modalities during training.\nConcretely, OPM weakens the influence of the dominant modality by dropping its\nfeature with dynamical probability in the feed-forward stage, while OGM\nmitigates its gradient in the back-propagation stage. In experiments, our\nmethods demonstrate considerable improvement across a variety of multimodal\ntasks. These simple yet effective strategies not only enhance performance in\nvanilla and task-oriented multimodal models, but also in more complex\nmultimodal tasks, showcasing their effectiveness and flexibility.

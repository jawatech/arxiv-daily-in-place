We examine whether and how writers want to preserve their\nauthentic voice when co-writing with AI tools and whether personalization of AI\nwriting support could help achieve this goal. We conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with 19 professional writers, during which they co-wrote with both\npersonalized and non-personalized AI writing-support tools. We supplemented\nwriters' perspectives with opinions from 30 avid readers about the written work\nco-produced with AI collected through an online survey. Our findings illuminate\nconceptions of authenticity in human-AI co-creation, which focus more on the\nprocess and experience of constructing creators' authentic selves. While\nwriters reacted positively to personalized AI writing tools, they believed the\nform of personalization needs to target writers' growth and go beyond the phase\nof text production. Overall, readers' responses showed less concern about\nhuman-AI co-writing. Readers could not distinguish AI-assisted work,\npersonalized or not, from writers' solo-written work and showed positive\nattitudes toward writers experimenting with new technology for creative\nwriting.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457 AI \u5beb\u4f5c\u8f14\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u591a\u6a23\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u8b80\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u90fd\u64d4\u5fc3\u9019\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u5c0d\u5beb\u4f5c\u4f5c\u54c1\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u5728\u8207 AI \u5de5\u5177\u5171\u540c\u5beb\u4f5c\u6642\uff0c\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u60f3\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u8072\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca AI \u5beb\u4f5c\u652f\u63f4\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u5316\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5be6\u73fe\u9019\u4e00\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d 19 \u4f4d\u5c08\u696d\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u534a\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u8a2a\u8ac7\uff0c\u5728\u8a2a\u8ac7\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u8207\u500b\u6027\u5316\u548c\u975e\u500b\u6027\u5316\u7684 AI \u5beb\u4f5c\u652f\u63f4\u5de5\u5177\u5171\u540c\u5beb\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u901a\u904e\u4e00\u9805\u7dda\u4e0a\u8abf\u67e5\uff0c\u7528 30 \u4f4d\u71b1\u5fc3\u8b80\u8005\u5c0d\u8207 AI \u5171\u540c\u5275\u4f5c\u7684\u66f8\u9762\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u610f\u898b\uff0c\u88dc\u5145\u4e86\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u89c0\u9ede\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u95e1\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u6a5f\u5171\u540c\u5275\u4f5c\u4e2d\u771f\u5be6\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5176\u66f4\u5074\u91cd\u65bc\u69cb\u5efa\u5275\u4f5c\u8005\u771f\u5be6\u81ea\u6211\u7684\u904e\u7a0b\u548c\u9ad4\u9a57\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u5c0d\u500b\u6027\u5316\u7684 AI \u5beb\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u53cd\u61c9\u7a4d\u6975\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5011\u8a8d\u70ba\u500b\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u9700\u8981\u91dd\u5c0d\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u6210\u9577\uff0c\u4e26\u8d85\u8d8a\u6587\u672c\u7522\u751f\u7684\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u7e3d\u9ad4\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8b80\u8005\u7684\u56de\u61c9\u5c0d\u4eba\u6a5f\u5171\u540c\u5beb\u4f5c\u7684\u95dc\u6ce8\u8f03\u5c11\u3002\u8b80\u8005\u7121\u6cd5\u5340\u5206 AI \u5354\u52a9\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff08\u7121\u8ad6\u662f\u5426\u500b\u6027\u5316\uff09\u548c\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u55ae\u7368\u5beb\u4f5c\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u5beb\u4f5c\u8005\u5617\u8a66\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u9032\u884c\u5275\u610f\u5beb\u4f5c\u8868\u73fe\u51fa\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u614b\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Angel Hsing-Chi Hwang et.al.", "authors": "Angel Hsing-Chi Hwang, Q.

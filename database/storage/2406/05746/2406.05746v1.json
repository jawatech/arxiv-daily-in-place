Existing deep\nlearning models lack explainability and mainly focus on image analysis. The\nrecently developed Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph (DUCG) approach is\ncausality-driven, explainable, and invariant across different application\nscenarios, without problems of data collection, labeling, fitting, privacy,\nbias, generalization, high cost and high energy consumption. Through close\ncollaboration between clinical experts and DUCG technicians, 46 DUCG models\ncovering 54 chief complaints were constructed. Over 1,000 diseases can be\ndiagnosed without triage. Before being applied in real-world, the 46 DUCG\nmodels were retrospectively verified by third-party hospitals. The verified\ndiagnostic precisions were no less than 95%, in which the diagnostic precision\nfor every disease including uncommon ones was no less than 80%. After\nverifications, the 46 DUCG models were applied in the real-world in China. Over\none million real diagnosis cases have been performed, with only 17 incorrect\ndiagnoses identified. Due to DUCG's transparency, the mistakes causing the\nincorrect diagnoses were found and corrected. The diagnostic abilities of the\nclinicians who applied DUCG frequently were improved significantly. Following\nthe introduction to the earlier presented DUCG methodology, the recommendation\nalgorithm for potential medical checks is presented and the key idea of DUCG is\nextracted.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u91ab\u7642\u7167\u8b77\u4e2d\u9700\u8981 AI \u8f14\u52a9\u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u8a3a\u65b7\u3002\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u958b\u767c\u7684\u52d5\u614b\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u95dc\u4fc2\u5716 (DUCG) \u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u8b8a\u7684\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u8cc7\u6599\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6a19\u8a18\u3001\u64ec\u5408\u3001\u96b1\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u898b\u3001\u6982\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u901a\u904e\u81e8\u5e8a\u5c08\u5bb6\u548c DUCG \u6280\u8853\u4eba\u54e1\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5bc6\u5207\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u69cb\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u84cb 54 \u500b\u4e3b\u8a34\u7684 46 \u500b DUCG \u6a21\u578b\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6c92\u6709\u5206\u6d41\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u8a3a\u65b7\u51fa 1,000 \u591a\u7a2e\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u5728\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5be6\u969b\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c46 \u500b DUCG \u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7531\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u91ab\u9662\u56de\u6eaf\u6027\u9a57\u8b49\u3002\u9a57\u8b49\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f4e\u65bc 95%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u7f55\u898b\u75be\u75c5\u5728\u5167\u7684\u6bcf\u7a2e\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f4e\u65bc 80%\u3002\u9a57\u8b49\u5f8c\uff0c46 \u500b DUCG \u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5728\u4e2d\u570b\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u3002\u5df2\u7d93\u57f7\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u904e\u4e00\u767e\u842c\u500b\u771f\u5be6\u8a3a\u65b7\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u50c5\u767c\u73fe 17 \u500b\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u3002\u7531\u65bc DUCG \u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u4e26\u7cfe\u6b63\u4e86\u5c0e\u81f4\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\u8a3a\u65b7\u7684\u932f\u8aa4\u3002\u983b\u7e41\u61c9\u7528 DUCG \u7684\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u751f\u7684\u8a3a\u65b7\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u986f\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u5728\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u524d\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 DUCG \u65b9\u6cd5\u8ad6\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f5b\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u6aa2\u67e5\u7684\u63a8\u85a6\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86 DUCG \u7684\u95dc\u9375\u601d\u60f3\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Zhan Zhang et.al.", "authors": "Zhan Zhang, Qin Zhang, Yang Jiao, Lin Lu, Lin Ma, Aihua Liu, Xiao Liu, Juan Zhao, Yajun Xue, Bing Wei, Mingxia Zhang, Ru Gao, Hong Zhao, Jie Lu, Fan Li, Yang Zhang, Yiming Wang, Lei Zhang, Fengwei Tian, Jie Hu, Xin Gou", "id": "2406.05746v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05746v1", "repo": "null"}}

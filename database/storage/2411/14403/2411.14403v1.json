{"2411.14403": {"publish_time": "2024-11-21", "title": "Landing Trajectory Prediction for UAS Based on Generative Adversarial Network", "paper_summary": "Models for trajectory prediction are an essential component of many advanced\nair mobility studies. These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan\navoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems\n(UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this\npaper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network\nthat has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved\nmany state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one\nneural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the\nlearning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to\nunderstand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the\nprevious trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight.\nAccording to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more\naccurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To\nevaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that\nincludes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u822a\u8de1\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u8a31\u591a\u5148\u9032\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d41\u52d5\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u98db\u6a5f\u5075\u6e2c\u885d\u7a81\u4e26\u898f\u5283\u907f\u8b93\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u7cfb\u7d71\uff08UAS\uff09\u8457\u9678\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5782\u76f4\u8d77\u964d\u6a5f\u5834\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u58c5\u585e\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u751f\u6210\u5c0d\u6297\u7db2\u8def\uff08GAN\uff09\u7684 UAS \u8457\u9678\u822a\u8de1\u9810\u6e2c\u6a21\u578b\u3002GAN \u662f\u4e00\u500b\u4e45\u8ca0\u76db\u540d\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u5df2\u7d93\u767c\u5c55\u591a\u5e74\u3002\u5728\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cGAN \u5728\u8a31\u591a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8a31\u591a\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002GAN \u5305\u542b\u4e00\u500b\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7522\u751f\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u5224\u5225\u5668\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7522\u751f\u5668\u80fd\u5920\u4e86\u89e3\u6a23\u672c\u822a\u8de1\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u7522\u751f\u5668\u5c07\u5148\u524d\u7684\u822a\u8de1\u4f5c\u70ba\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u4e26\u8f38\u51fa\u98db\u884c\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u96a8\u6a5f\u72c0\u614b\u3002\u6839\u64da\u7d93\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u8f38\u51fa\u6bd4\u57fa\u7dda\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GMR\uff09\u66f4\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u8a55\u4f30\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u771f\u5be6\u7684\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u8457\u9678\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u904e 2600 \u689d\u7531\u771f\u5be6\u98db\u884c\u54e1\u624b\u52d5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7121\u4eba\u6a5f\u822a\u8de1\u3002", "author": "Jun Xiang et.al.", "authors": "Jun Xiang, Drake Essick, Luiz Gonzalez Bautista, Junfei Xie, Jun Chen", "id": "2411.14403v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14403v1", "repo": "null"}}

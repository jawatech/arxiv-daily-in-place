Basically, we classify the\nhypothesis into three labels(entailment, neutrality and contradiction) given\nthe premise. NLI was well studied by the previous researchers. A number of\nmodels, especially the transformer based ones, have achieved significant\nimprovement on these tasks. However, it is reported that these models are\nsuffering when they are dealing with hard datasets. Particularly, they perform\nmuch worse when dealing with unseen out-of-distribution premise and hypothesis.\nThey may not understand the semantic content but learn the spurious\ncorrelations. In this work, we propose the data augmentation and preprocessing\nmethods to solve the word overlap, numerical reasoning and length mismatch\nproblems. These methods are general methods that do not rely on the\ndistribution of the testing data and they help improve the robustness of the\nmodels.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u63a8\u7406 (NLI) \u662f\u4e00\u9805\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u63a8\u65b7\u5047\u8a2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7531\u7d66\u5b9a\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u8b49\u660e\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6839\u64da\u524d\u63d0\u5c07\u5047\u8a2d\u5206\u985e\u70ba\u4e09\u7a2e\u985e\u5225\uff08\u860a\u542b\u3001\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u77db\u76fe\uff09\u3002NLI \u5df2\u88ab\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u54e1\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8a31\u591a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u8f49\u63db\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u9019\u4e9b\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u9032\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u64da\u5831\u5c0e\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8655\u7406\u56f0\u96e3\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u6642\u6703\u9047\u5230\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u7576\u8655\u7406\u672a\u898b\u904e\u3001\u5206\u4f48\u4e0d\u5747\u52fb\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u548c\u5047\u8a2d\u6642\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6703\u5dee\u5f88\u591a\u3002\u5b83\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u7121\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u8a9e\u7fa9\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u6703\u5b78\u7fd2\u865b\u5047\u7684\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u8cc7\u6599\u64f4\u5145\u548c\u9810\u8655\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5b57\u8a5e\u91cd\u758a\u3001\u6578\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9577\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u6e2c\u8a66\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002", "author": "Zijiang Yang et.al.", "authors": "Zijiang Yang", "id": "2412.07108v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07108v1", "repo": "null"}}

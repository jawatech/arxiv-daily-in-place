This research work primary uses transfer\nlearning models such as ResNet, ImageNet, and VNet to extract high-level\nfeatures from medical image data. Thereafter, these pre-trained models were\nfine-tuned for Alzheimer's related subtle patterns such that the model is\ncapable of robust feature extraction over varying data sources. Further, the\nfederated learning approaches were incorporated to tackle a few other\nchallenges related to classification, aimed to provide better prediction\nperformance and protect data privacy. The proposed model was built using\nfederated learning without sharing sensitive patient data. This way, the\ndecentralized model benefits from the large and diversified dataset that it is\ntrained upon while ensuring confidentiality. The cipher-based encryption\nmechanism is added that allows us to secure the transportation of data and\nfurther ensure the privacy and integrity of patient information throughout\ntraining and classification. The results of the experiments not only help to\nimprove the accuracy of the classification of Alzheimer's but at the same time\nprovides a framework for secure and collaborative analysis of health care data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u65b0\u7684\u963f\u8332\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u5206\u985e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8a72\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d50\u5408\u4e86\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6578\u64da\u8655\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528 ResNet\u3001ImageNet \u548c VNet \u7b49\u9077\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u5f9e\u91ab\u5b78\u5f71\u50cf\u6578\u64da\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7d1a\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u96a8\u5f8c\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u9810\u8a13\u7df4\u6a21\u578b\u91dd\u5c0d\u963f\u8332\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u7d30\u5fae\u6a21\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u8abf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5920\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u6578\u64da\u6e90\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u9032\u884c\u7a69\u5065\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u7d0d\u5165\u4ee5\u61c9\u5c0d\u8207\u5206\u985e\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u5e7e\u500b\u5176\u4ed6\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4fdd\u8b77\u6578\u64da\u96b1\u79c1\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u806f\u90a6\u5b78\u7fd2\u69cb\u5efa\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u654f\u611f\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u6578\u64da\u3002\u9019\u6a23\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e\u5176\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u5927\u578b\u4e14\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u78ba\u4fdd\u6a5f\u5bc6\u6027\u3002\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u57fa\u65bc\u5bc6\u78bc\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u78ba\u4fdd\u6578\u64da\u50b3\u8f38\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u78ba\u4fdd\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6574\u500b\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u5206\u985e\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u96b1\u79c1\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u4e0d\u50c5\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u63d0\u9ad8\u963f\u8332\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u5206\u985e\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u9084\u70ba\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u6578\u64da\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5354\u4f5c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "author": "Rishit Kapoor et.al.", "authors": "Rishit Kapoor, Jesher Joshua, Muralidharan Vijayarangan, Natarajan B", "id": "2411.12756v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12756v1", "repo": "null"}}

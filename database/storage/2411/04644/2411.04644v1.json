Existing approaches to\nthis problem have typically used deep learning models designed and trained to\noperate on one or more specific input signals. However, the datasets used to\ndevelop these models often do not contain the same sets of input signals. Some\nsignals, particularly PPG, are much less prevalent than others, and this has\npreviously been addressed with techniques such as transfer learning.\nAdditionally, only training on one or more fixed modalities precludes\ncross-modal information transfer from other sources, which has proved valuable\nin other problem domains. To address this, we introduce wav2sleep, a unified\nmodel designed to operate on variable sets of input signals during training and\ninference. After jointly training on over 10,000 overnight recordings from six\npublicly available polysomnography datasets, including SHHS and MESA, wav2sleep\noutperforms existing sleep stage classification models across test-time input\ncombinations including ECG, PPG, and respiratory signals.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u900f\u904e\u8f03\u4e0d\u5177\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u611f\u6e2c\u5668\u91cf\u6e2c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5fc3\u96fb\u5716 (ECG) \u6216\u5149\u96fb\u5bb9\u7a4d\u63cf\u8a18\u5100 (PPG)\uff0c\u6e96\u78ba\u5206\u985e\u7761\u7720\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u80fd\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7761\u7720\u91ab\u5b78\u4e2d\u3002\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u8a13\u7df4\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8655\u7406\u4e00\u500b\u6216\u591a\u500b\u7279\u5b9a\u8f38\u5165\u8a0a\u865f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u958b\u767c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u8a0a\u865f\u7d44\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u8a0a\u865f\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f PPG\uff0c\u9060\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8a0a\u865f\u4e0d\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u5148\u524d\u5df2\u900f\u904e\u8f49\u79fb\u5b78\u7fd2\u7b49\u6280\u8853\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u50c5\u8a13\u7df4\u4e00\u7a2e\u6216\u591a\u7a2e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6703\u6392\u9664\u4f86\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u4f86\u6e90\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8cc7\u8a0a\u50b3\u8f38\uff0c\u9019\u5df2\u8b49\u660e\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u554f\u984c\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u5f88\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 wav2sleep\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7d71\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8a2d\u8a08\u7528\u65bc\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u63a8\u8ad6\u671f\u9593\u8655\u7406\u8b8a\u6578\u7d44\u7684\u8f38\u5165\u8a0a\u865f\u3002\u5728\u5c0d\u4f86\u81ea\u516d\u500b\u516c\u958b\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u7761\u7720\u751f\u7406\u6aa2\u67e5\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec SHHS \u548c MESA\uff09\u7684 10,000 \u591a\u500b\u904e\u591c\u8a18\u9304\u9032\u884c\u806f\u5408\u8a13\u7df4\u5f8c\uff0cwav2sleep \u5728\u6e2c\u8a66\u6642\u9593\u8f38\u5165\u7d44\u5408\uff08\u5305\u62ec ECG\u3001PPG \u548c\u547c\u5438\u8a0a\u865f\uff09\u4e2d\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u7761\u7720\u968e\u6bb5\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "author": "Jonathan F.

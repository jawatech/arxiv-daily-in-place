Left unaddressed, this\ncondition can yield substantial negative consequences, impacting social\ninteractions and performance. Further understanding its diverse physical and\nemotional symptoms becomes pivotal for comprehensive diagnosis and tailored\ntherapeutic interventions.

By employing a novel approach, the research utilizes\nBART-based multi-label zero-shot classification to identify and measure symptom\nprevalence and significance in the form of probability score for each symptom\nunder consideration. Results uncover distinctive patterns: \"Trembling\" emerges\nas a prevalent physical symptom, while emotional symptoms like \"Fear of being\njudged negatively\" exhibit high frequencies. These findings offer insights into\nthe multifaceted nature of social anxiety, aiding clinical practices and\ninterventions tailored to its diverse expressions.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Muhammad Rizwan et.al.", "authors": "Muhammad Rizwan,Jure Dem\u0161ar", "id": "2404.17183v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17183v1", "repo": "null"}}

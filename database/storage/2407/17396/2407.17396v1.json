We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work on\nreasoning with GNNs has shown that such models tend to fail when presented with\ntest examples that require longer inference chains than those seen during\ntraining. This suggests that GNNs lack the ability to generalize from training\nexamples in a systematic way, which would fundamentally limit their reasoning\nabilities. A common solution is to instead rely on neuro-symbolic methods,\nwhich are capable of reasoning in a systematic way by design. Unfortunately,\nthe scalability of such methods is often limited and they tend to rely on\noverly strong assumptions, e.g.\\ that queries can be answered by inspecting a\nsingle relational path. In this paper, we revisit the idea of reasoning with\nGNNs, showing that systematic generalization is possible as long as the right\ninductive bias is provided. In particular, we argue that node embeddings should\nbe treated as epistemic states and that GNN should be parameterised\naccordingly. We propose a simple GNN architecture which is based on this view\nand show that it is capable of achieving state-of-the-art results. We\nfurthermore introduce a benchmark which requires models to aggregate evidence\nfrom multiple relational paths. We show that existing neuro-symbolic approaches\nfail on this benchmark, whereas our considered GNN model learns to reason\naccurately.", "paper_summary_zh": "<paragraph>\u958b\u767c\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u7684\u56f0\u96e3\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u95dc\u4fc2\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5716\u5f62\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (GNN) \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u81ea\u7136\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u95dc\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528 GNN \u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u7576\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u8a13\u7df4\u671f\u9593\u6240\u898b\u66f4\u9577\u63a8\u8ad6\u93c8\u7684\u6e2c\u8a66\u7bc4\u4f8b\u6642\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u6703\u5931\u6557\u3002\u9019\u8868\u660e GNN \u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7d71\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f9e\u8a13\u7df4\u7bc4\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6982\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u5f9e\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e00\u500b\u5e38\u898b\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u6539\u800c\u4f9d\u8cf4\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e0a\u80fd\u5920\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7d71\u65b9\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6b64\u985e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u64f4\u5145\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b83\u5011\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8cf4\u65bc\u904e\u65bc\u5f37\u70c8\u7684\u5047\u8a2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u67e5\u8a62\u53ef\u4ee5\u900f\u904e\u6aa2\u67e5\u55ae\u4e00\u95dc\u4fc2\u8def\u5f91\u4f86\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u91cd\u65b0\u63a2\u8a0e\u4f7f\u7528 GNN \u63a8\u7406\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u53ea\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b63\u78ba\u7684\u6b78\u7d0d\u504f\u8aa4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7d71\u6982\u5316\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e3b\u5f35\u7bc0\u9ede\u5d4c\u5165\u61c9\u8996\u70ba\u8a8d\u8b58\u72c0\u614b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14 GNN \u61c9\u76f8\u61c9\u5730\u53c3\u6578\u5316\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u6b64\u89c0\u9ede\u7684\u7c21\u55ae GNN \u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4e26\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u80fd\u5920\u5be6\u73fe\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5f9e\u591a\u500b\u95dc\u4fc2\u8def\u5f91\u532f\u7e3d\u8b49\u64da\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8868\u660e\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7d93\u7b26\u865f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u6e96\u4e0a\u5931\u6557\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u5011\u8003\u616e\u7684 GNN \u6a21\u578b\u5247\u5b78\u6703\u6e96\u78ba\u63a8\u7406\u3002</paragraph>", "author": "Irtaza Khalid et.al.", "authors": "Irtaza Khalid, Steven Schockaert", "id": "2407.17396v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17396v1", "repo": "null"}}

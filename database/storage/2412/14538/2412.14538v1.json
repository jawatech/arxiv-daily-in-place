This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and\ncommunication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles,\ninherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a\nretrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models,\nunderscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication\ntechnologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the\nenvisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three\nprogressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on\nemploying AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance\nuser service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the\nrole of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents\nkey enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic\ncommunication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that\nfuture 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support\napplication scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial\nrobots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers\nto the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In\naddition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the\nstandardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key\nmilestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research\nopportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and\ncommunication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation\ncommunication infrastructure.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u96a8\u8457\u5c0d\u7121\u7e2b\u9023\u63a5\u548c\u667a\u6167\u901a\u8a0a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167 (AI) \u548c\u7b2c\u516d\u4ee3 (6G) \u7db2\u8def\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6b63\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u9805\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u548c 6G \u7db2\u8def\u7684\u901a\u8a0a\uff0c\u5f37\u8abf\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3001\u5167\u5728\u6311\u6230\u548c\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u56de\u9867\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f14\u9032\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u5f37\u8abf\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u5851\u9020\u7576\u4ee3\u901a\u8a0a\u6280\u8853\u4e2d\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u63a5\u8457\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8f49\u800c\u8a73\u7d30\u95e1\u8ff0\u5728 6G \u7db2\u8def\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u9858\u666f\uff0c\u4e26\u8aaa\u660e\u4e09\u500b\u6f38\u9032\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u904b\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u7db2\u8def\u6548\u80fd\u3001\u6700\u4f73\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u670d\u52d9\u9ad4\u9a57\u3002\u5f8c\u7e8c\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u5f37\u8abf\u7db2\u8def\u5728\u4fc3\u9032\u548c\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u904b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u51fa\u95dc\u9375\u7684\u4fc3\u6210\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u7684\u6578\u4f4d\u96d9\u80de\u80ce\u548c\u8a9e\u610f\u901a\u8a0a\u3002\u5728\u6700\u5f8c\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5373\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u9810\u8a08\u672a\u4f86 6G \u7db2\u8def\u5c07\u5929\u751f\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u70ba\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u4e26\u652f\u63f4\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u901a\u8a0a\u548c\u667a\u6167\u7522\u696d\u6a5f\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u61c9\u7528\u5834\u666f\u3002\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u670d\u52d9\u54c1\u8cea\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u6307\u7db2\u8def\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u670d\u52d9\u7684\u91cf\u6e2c\u67b6\u69cb\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u5c55\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5fb9\u5e95\u6aa2\u8996\u4e86\u8207\u7db2\u8def\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u91cd\u9ede\u8aaa\u660e\u95dc\u9375\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u548c\u6b63\u5728\u9032\u884c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52d5\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u548c 6G \u901a\u8a0a\u6f14\u9032\u548c\u7cbe\u9032\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u5c07\u5b83\u5011\u5b9a\u4f4d\u70ba\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u8a0a\u57fa\u790e\u67b6\u69cb\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u3002", "author": "Qimei Cui et.al.", "authors": "Qimei Cui, Xiaohu You, Ni Wei, Guoshun Nan, Xuefei Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Xinchen Lyu, Ming Ai, Xiaofeng Tao, Zhiyong Feng, Ping Zhang, Qingqing Wu, Meixia Tao, Yongming Huang, Chongwen Huang, Guangyi Liu, Chenghui Peng, Zhiwen Pan, Tao Sun, Dusit Niyato, Tao Chen, Muhammad Khurram Khan, Abbas Jamalipour, Mohsen Guizani, Chau Yuen", "id": "2412.14538v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14538v1", "repo": "null"}}

We test the ability of a typical pipeline to capture the style known\ncolloquially as \"gay voice\" and notice a homogenisation effect: synthesised\nspeech is rated as sounding significantly \"less gay\" (by LGBTQ+ participants)\nthan its corresponding ground-truth for speakers with \"gay voice\", but ratings\nactually increase for control speakers. Loss of \"gay voice\" has implications\nfor accessibility. We also find that for speakers with \"gay voice\", loss of\n\"gay voice\" corresponds to lower similarity ratings.\n  However, we caution that improving the ability of such models to synthesise\n``gay voice'' comes with a great number of risks. We use this pipeline as a\nstarting point for a discussion on the ethics of modelling queer voices more\nbroadly. Collecting \"clean\" queer data has safety and fairness ramifications,\nand the resulting technology may cause harms from mockery to death.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u8072\u97f3\u8907\u88fd\u6a21\u578b\u8072\u7a31\u80fd\u5920\u6355\u6349\u5404\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8072\u97f3\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6e2c\u8a66\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5178\u578b\u7ba1\u9053\u6355\u6349\u53e3\u8a9e\u4e2d\u7a31\u70ba\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u7684\u98a8\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e26\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u540c\u8cea\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u8a9e\u97f3\u88ab\u8a55\u70ba\u807d\u8d77\u4f86\u660e\u986f\u300c\u4e0d\u90a3\u9ebc\u540c\u5fd7\u300d\uff08\u7531 LGBTQ+ \u53c3\u8207\u8005\u8a55\u5206\uff09\u6bd4\u5176\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e8b\u5be6\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0d\u7167\u7d44\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u7684\u8a55\u5206\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5931\u53bb\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u5c0d\u7121\u969c\u7919\u6027\u6709\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6211\u5011\u9084\u767c\u73fe\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u8aaa\u8a71\u8005\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5931\u53bb\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u5c0d\u61c9\u8457\u8f03\u4f4e\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8a55\u5206\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b64\u985e\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u300c\u540c\u5fd7\u8154\u300d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u8a31\u591a\u98a8\u96aa\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u9019\u500b\u7ba1\u9053\u4f5c\u70ba\u8a0e\u8ad6\u6a21\u64ec\u9177\u5152\u8072\u97f3\u66f4\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u502b\u7406\u7684\u8d77\u9ede\u3002\u6536\u96c6\u300c\u4e7e\u6de8\u300d\u7684\u9177\u5152\u6578\u64da\u5177\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u800c\u7531\u6b64\u7522\u751f\u7684\u6280\u8853\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u9020\u6210\u5f9e\u5632\u7b11\u5230\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u50b7\u5bb3\u3002", "author": "Atli Sigurgeirsson et.al.", "authors": "Atli Sigurgeirsson, Eddie L.

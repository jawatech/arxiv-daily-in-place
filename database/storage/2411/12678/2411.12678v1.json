Methods to measure depth often are invasive and less specific. This\npaper introduces a novel method that is non-invasive with deep learning\ntechniques using classifying of skin layers that helps in measurement of wound\ndepth through heatmap analysis. A set of approximately 200 labeled images of\nskin allows five classes to be distinguished: scars, wounds, and healthy skin,\namong others. Each image has annotated key layers, namely the stratum cornetum,\nthe epidermis, and the dermis, in the software Roboflow. In the preliminary\nstage, the Heatmap generator VGG16 was used to enhance the visibility of tissue\nlayers, based upon which their annotated images were used to train ResNet18\nwith early stopping techniques. It ended up at a very high accuracy rate of\n97.67%. To do this, the comparison of the models ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121,\nand EfficientNet has been done where both EfficientNet and ResNet18 have\nattained accuracy rates of almost 95.35%. For further hyperparameter tuning,\nEfficientNet and ResNet18 were trained at six different learning rates to\ndetermine the best model configuration. It has been noted that the accuracy has\nhuge variations with different learning rates. In the case of EfficientNet, the\nmaximum achievable accuracy was 95.35% at the rate of 0.0001. The same was true\nfor ResNet18, which also attained its peak value of 95.35% at the same rate.\nThese facts indicate that the model can be applied and utilized in actual-time,\nnon-invasive wound assessment, which holds a great promise to improve clinical\ndiagnosis and treatment planning.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e86\u89e3\u50b7\u53e3\u90e8\u4f4d\u9069\u7576\u7684\u76ae\u819a\u5c64\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u52d5\u50b7\u53e3\u7652\u5408\u5be6\u52d9\u548c\u6cbb\u7642\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6e2c\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u5920\u5177\u9ad4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e00\u7a2e\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6280\u8853\u5c0d\u76ae\u819a\u5c64\u9032\u884c\u5206\u985e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u900f\u904e\u71b1\u5716\u5206\u6790\u6e2c\u91cf\u50b7\u53e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u4e00\u7d44\u7d04 200 \u5f35\u6a19\u8a18\u7684\u76ae\u819a\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u53ef\u5340\u5206\u70ba\u4e94\u985e\uff1a\u75a4\u75d5\u3001\u50b7\u53e3\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u76ae\u819a\u7b49\u3002\u6bcf\u5f35\u5f71\u50cf\u5728 Roboflow \u8edf\u9ad4\u4e2d\u90fd\u6a19\u8a3b\u4e86\u95dc\u9375\u5c64\uff0c\u5373\u89d2\u8cea\u5c64\u3001\u8868\u76ae\u548c\u771f\u76ae\u3002\u5728\u521d\u6b65\u968e\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u71b1\u5716\u7522\u751f\u5668 VGG16 \u4f86\u589e\u5f37\u7d44\u7e54\u5c64\u7684\u53ef\u898b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u5176\u6a19\u8a3b\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u7528\u65bc\u8a13\u7df4 ResNet18\uff0c\u4e26\u63a1\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u9054\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u7387 97.67%\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\uff0c\u5c0d ResNet18\u3001VGG16\u3001DenseNet121 \u548c EfficientNet \u9032\u884c\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f03\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d EfficientNet \u548c ResNet18 \u90fd\u9054\u5230\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1 95.35% \u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u8abf\u6574\u8d85\u53c3\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u516d\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u7387\u8a13\u7df4 EfficientNet \u548c ResNet18\uff0c\u4ee5\u78ba\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u5df2\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u6703\u96a8\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u7387\u800c\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u5728 EfficientNet \u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728 0.0001 \u7684\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u9054\u5230\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6e96\u78ba\u7387\u70ba 95.35%\u3002ResNet18 \u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u4e5f\u9054\u5230\u4e86 95.35% \u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u4e8b\u5be6\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8a72\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u5be6\u969b\u6642\u9593\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u50b7\u53e3\u8a55\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u6539\u5584\u81e8\u5e8a\u8a3a\u65b7\u548c\u6cbb\u7642\u8a08\u756b\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002", "author": "Devakumar GR et.al.", "authors": "Devakumar GR, JB Kaarthikeyan, Dominic Immanuel T, Sheena Christabel Pravin", "id": "2411.12678v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12678v1", "repo": "null"}}

This study\nproposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working\nmemory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is\nparticularly efficient, into language models. The proposed method introduces a\nmechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of\ntraining and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as\nlearning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed\nmethod outperforms conventional models without memory constraints or with\nstatic memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for\ndesigning data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence\nsupporting the underlying mechanisms of the critical period hypothesis in human\nlanguage acquisition.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73fe\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8207\u4eba\u985e\u6709\u986f\u8457\u7684\u5dee\u7570\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c07\u5de5\u4f5c\u8a18\u61b6\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u671f\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u7279\u5fb5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u95dc\u9375\u671f\u662f\u4eba\u985e\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u7279\u5225\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u968e\u6bb5\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u6a5f\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5728\u8a13\u7df4\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u968e\u6bb5\u9650\u5236\u5de5\u4f5c\u8a18\u61b6\uff0c\u4e26\u96a8\u8457\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u4ee5\u6307\u6578\u65b9\u5f0f\u9010\u6f38\u653e\u5bec\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6709\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u8a55\u4f30\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u512a\u65bc\u6c92\u6709\u8a18\u61b6\u9650\u5236\u6216\u5177\u6709\u975c\u614b\u8a18\u61b6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u767c\u73fe\u4e0d\u50c5\u70ba\u8a2d\u8a08\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e5f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u985e\u8a9e\u8a00\u7fd2\u5f97\u4e2d\u95dc\u9375\u671f\u5047\u8a2d\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u6a5f\u5236\u7684\u9593\u63a5\u8b49\u64da\u3002", "author": "Masato Mita et.al.", "authors": "Masato Mita, Ryo Yoshida, Yohei Oseki", "id": "2502.04795v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04795v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, integration into routine clinical practice has\nbeen slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory\nhurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and\nthe lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA\ninitiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's\nachievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the\npathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry.\nIn close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards,\nrecommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability\nmethods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and\nsuccessfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different\nvendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized\ninterface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real\nclinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia.\nIn addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders\nto share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial,\nclinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source\ninterfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and\nstreamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and\nbroadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a\nsustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International,\nhas been established to continue standardization and support broad\nimplementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Norman Zerbe et.al.", "authors": "Norman Zerbe,Lars Ole Schwen,Christian Gei\u00dfler,Katja Wiesemann,Tom Bisson,Peter Boor,Rita Carvalho,Michael Franz,Christoph Jansen,Tim-Rasmus Kiehl,Bj\u00f6rn Lindequist,Nora Charlotte Pohlan,Sarah Schmell,Klaus Strohmenger,Falk Zakrzewski,Markus Plass,Michael Takla,Tobias K\u00fcster,Andr\u00e9 Homeyer,Peter Hufnagl", "id": "2401.09450v2", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09450v2", "repo": "null"}}

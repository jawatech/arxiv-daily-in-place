In this work, we characterize the relative merits of\ndifferent merging methods by evaluating them in a shared experimental setting\nand precisely identifying the practical requirements of each method.\nSpecifically, our setting focuses on using merging for compositional\ngeneralization of capabilities in image classification, image generation, and\nnatural language processing. Additionally, we measure the computational costs\nof different merging methods as well as how they perform when scaling the\nnumber of models being merged. Taken together, our results clarify the state of\nthe field of model merging and provide a comprehensive and rigorous\nexperimental setup to test new methods.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5408\u4f75\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u7a2e\u5ee3\u6cdb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u500b\u5225\u6a21\u578b\u5ec9\u50f9\u5730\u5408\u4f75\u6210\u55ae\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7e7c\u627f\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u4e26\u7372\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\n\u9019\u7a2e\u666e\u53ca\u6027\u523a\u6fc0\u4e86\u8a31\u591a\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u4f75\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7d93\u5e38\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u69cb\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u904b\u7b97\u9810\u7b97\u6240\u505a\u7684\u5047\u8a2d\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u900f\u904e\u5728\u5171\u7528\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u8a55\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5408\u4f75\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e26\u7cbe\u78ba\u8b58\u5225\u6bcf\u7a2e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5be6\u969b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f86\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u76f8\u5c0d\u512a\u9ede\u3002\n\u5177\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u8457\u91cd\u65bc\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u4f75\u4f86\u9032\u884c\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u6982\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6e2c\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u4f75\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u5728\u64f4\u5145\u5408\u4f75\u6a21\u578b\u6578\u91cf\u6642\u7684\u57f7\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7d9c\u5408\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u91d0\u6e05\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u4f75\u9818\u57df\u7684\u73fe\u6cc1\uff0c\u4e26\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u56b4\u8b39\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4f86\u6e2c\u8a66\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "author": "Derek Tam et.al.", "authors": "Derek Tam, Yash Kant, Brian Lester, Igor Gilitschenski, Colin Raffel", "id": "2409.18314v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18314v1", "repo": "null"}}

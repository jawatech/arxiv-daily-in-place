We focus on two fundamental problems between speech\nand text: the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency. We\npropose Soundwave, which utilizes an efficient training strategy and a novel\narchitecture to address these issues. Results show that Soundwave outperforms\nthe advanced Qwen2-Audio in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks,\nusing only one-fiftieth of the training data. Further analysis shows that\nSoundwave still retains its intelligence during conversation.

In this paper,\nwe analyze the state-of-the-art with a particular focus on European and African\nlanguages. We show how the majority of the work in this field concentrates on\nfew languages, and that there is potential for future research to cover also\nthe less investigated languages to contribute to more diversity in the research\nfield.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6aa2\u6e2c\u548c\u7de9\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a5f\u5668\u7ffb\u8b6f\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u6cc1\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u95dc\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7d71\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u53cd\u6620\u6216\u5f37\u5316\u793e\u6703\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u9032\u7684\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u95dc\u6ce8\u6b50\u6d32\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8a72\u9818\u57df\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5de5\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6578\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u672a\u4f86\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u6db5\u84cb\u7814\u7a76\u8f03\u5c11\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u9032\u7814\u7a76\u9818\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6a23\u6027\u3002", "author": "Catherine Ikae et.al.", "authors": "Catherine Ikae, Mascha Kurpicz-Briki", "id": "2410.21126v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21126v1", "repo": "null"}}

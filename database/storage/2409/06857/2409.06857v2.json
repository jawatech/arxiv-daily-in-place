{"2409.06857": {"publish_time": "2024-09-10", "title": "What is the Role of Small Models in the LLM Era: A Survey", "paper_summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing\nartificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of\nincreasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up\nmodel sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy\nconsumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and\nbusinesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are\nfrequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently\nunderestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models\nin the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior\nresearch. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs\nand SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this\nsurvey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper\nunderstanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient\nuse of computational resources.

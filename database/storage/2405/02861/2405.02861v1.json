Unlike prior\nstudies, it is the first work to propose a framework from the comparative\nperspective to model the general semantic phrase (i.e., lexical collocation)\nand three fine-grained semantic phrases, including idiomatic expression, noun\ncompound, and verbal construction. Thanks to \\ourbenchmark, we assess the\nperformance of 15 LMs across model architectures and parameter scales in\nclassification, extraction, and interpretation tasks. Through the experiments,\nwe first validate the scaling law and find that, as expected, large models\nexcel better than the smaller ones in most tasks. Second, we investigate\nfurther through the scaling semantic relation categorization and find that\nfew-shot LMs still lag behind vanilla fine-tuned models in the task. Third,\nthrough human evaluation, we find that the performance of strong models is\ncomparable to the human level regarding semantic phrase processing. Our\nbenchmarking findings can serve future research aiming to improve the generic\ncapability of LMs on semantic phrase comprehension.

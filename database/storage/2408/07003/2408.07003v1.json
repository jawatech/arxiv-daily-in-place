This paper proposes\nto assess the reliability of three LLMs, namely flan, GPT-4o, and GPT-4 mini\nfor topic labelling. Drawing on previous research leveraging BERTopic, we\ngenerate topics from a dataset of all the scientific articles (n=34,797)\nauthored by all biology professors in Switzerland (n=465) between 2008 and\n2020, as recorded in the Web of Science database. We assess the output of the\nthree models both quantitatively and qualitatively and find that, first, both\nGPT models are capable of accurately and precisely label topics from the\nmodels' output keywords. Second, 3-word labels are preferable to grasp the\ncomplexity of research topics.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u4e3b\u984c\u5efa\u6a21\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u79d1\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u986f\u8457\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5141\u8a31\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u89e3\u91cb\u7814\u7a76\u8da8\u52e2\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u88ab\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u70ba\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52d5\u89e3\u91cb\u624d\u80fd\u6a19\u7c64\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8a55\u4f30\u4e09\u500b LLM \u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5373 flan\u3001GPT-4o \u548c GPT-4 mini\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u4e3b\u984c\u6a19\u7c64\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5229\u7528 BERTopic \u7684\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f9e\u6240\u6709\u751f\u7269\u5b78\u6559\u6388\u5728\u745e\u58eb\uff08n=465\uff09\u65bc 2008 \u5e74\u81f3 2020 \u5e74\u9593\u64b0\u5beb\u7684\u6240\u6709\u79d1\u5b78\u6587\u7ae0\uff08n=34,797\uff09\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u984c\uff0c\u5982 Web of Science \u6578\u64da\u5eab\u4e2d\u6240\u8a18\u9304\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u9019\u4e09\u500b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f38\u51fa\u9032\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u767c\u73fe\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5169\u500b GPT \u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u6e96\u78ba\u4e14\u7cbe\u78ba\u5730\u6a19\u8a18\u6a21\u578b\u8f38\u51fa\u95dc\u9375\u5b57\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c3 \u5b57\u6a19\u7c64\u66f4\u9069\u5408\u638c\u63e1\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u984c\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u3002", "author": "Diego Kozlowski et.al.", "authors": "Diego Kozlowski, Carolina Pradier, Pierre Benz", "id": "2408.07003v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07003v1", "repo": "null"}}

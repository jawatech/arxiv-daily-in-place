Simulations in which an LLM was asked to answer subjective\nquestions were conducted more than 1 million times. Comparison of the responses\nfrom different LLMs with real data from the European Social Survey (ESS)\nsuggests that the effect of prompts on bias and variability is fundamental,\nhighlighting major cultural, age, and gender biases. Methods for measuring the\ndifference between LLMs and survey data are discussed, such as calculating\nweighted means and a new proposed measure inspired by Jaccard similarity. We\nconclude that it is important to analyze the robustness and variability of\nprompts before using LLMs to model individual decisions or collective behavior,\nas their imitation abilities are approximate at best.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u662f\u5426\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u89c0\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u50be\u5411\uff1f\u6211\u5011\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u904e 100 \u842c\u6b21\u7684\u6a21\u64ec\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u64ec\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8981\u6c42 LLM \u56de\u7b54\u4e3b\u89c0\u554f\u984c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e0d\u540c LLM \u7684\u56de\u61c9\u8207\u6b50\u6d32\u793e\u6703\u8abf\u67e5 (ESS) \u7684\u771f\u5be6\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u5c0d\u504f\u898b\u548c\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7a81\u986f\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u6587\u5316\u3001\u5e74\u9f61\u548c\u6027\u5225\u504f\u898b\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a0e\u8ad6\u4e86\u8861\u91cf LLM \u548c\u8abf\u67e5\u8cc7\u6599\u4e4b\u9593\u5dee\u7570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8a08\u7b97\u52a0\u6b0a\u5e73\u5747\u6578\u548c\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u8b70\u6e2c\u91cf\uff0c\u9748\u611f\u4f86\u81ea Jaccard \u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f97\u51fa\u7d50\u8ad6\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528 LLM \u4f86\u5efa\u6a21\u500b\u4eba\u6c7a\u7b56\u6216\u96c6\u9ad4\u884c\u70ba\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u548c\u8b8a\u7570\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u80fd\u529b\u5145\u5176\u91cf\u53ea\u662f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\u3002", "author": "Mingmeng Geng et.al.", "authors": "Mingmeng Geng, Sihong He, Roberto Trotta", "id": "2405.19323v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19323v1", "repo": "null"}}

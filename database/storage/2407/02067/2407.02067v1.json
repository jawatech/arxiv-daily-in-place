We first\nintroduce Dalle Street, a large-scale dataset generated by DALL-E 3 and\nvalidated by humans, containing 9,935 images of 67 countries and 10 concept\nclasses. We reveal disparities in cultural understanding at the sub-region\nlevel with both open-weight (LLaVA) and closed-source (GPT-4V) models on Dalle\nStreet and other existing benchmarks. Next, we assess models' deeper culture\nunderstanding by an artifact extraction task and identify over 18,000 artifacts\nassociated with different countries. Finally, we propose a highly composable\npipeline, CultureAdapt, to adapt images from culture to culture. Our findings\nreveal a nuanced picture of the cultural competence of LMMs, highlighting the\nneed to develop culture-aware systems.

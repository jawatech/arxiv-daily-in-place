However, current ultrasound robots lack the intelligence to\nunderstand human intentions and instructions, hindering autonomous ultrasound\nscanning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Ultrasound Embodied\nIntelligence system that equips ultrasound robots with the large language model\n(LLM) and domain knowledge, thereby improving the efficiency of ultrasound\nrobots. Specifically, we first design an ultrasound operation knowledge\ndatabase to add expertise in ultrasound scanning to the LLM, enabling the LLM\nto perform precise motion planning. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic ultrasound\nscanning strategy based on a \\textit{think-observe-execute} prompt engineering,\nallowing LLMs to dynamically adjust motion planning strategies during the\nscanning procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nsignificantly improves ultrasound scan efficiency and quality from verbal\ncommands. This advancement in autonomous medical scanning technology\ncontributes to non-invasive diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Huan Xu et.al.", "authors": "Huan Xu,Jinlin Wu,Guanglin Cao,Zhen Lei,Zhen Chen,Hongbin Liu", "id": "2405.00461v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00461v1", "repo": "null"}}

However, it is challenging to achieve accurate\nsegmentation due to low contrast and blood flow noises presented in the images.\nIn addition, the algorithm should be light-weight to be deployed for practical\nclinical applications. Therefore, it is desired to design a light-weight\nnetwork with high performance for retinal layer segmentation. In this paper, we\npropose LightReSeg for retinal layer segmentation which can be applied to OCT\nimages. Specifically, our approach follows an encoder-decoder structure, where\nthe encoder part employs multi-scale feature extraction and a Transformer block\nfor fully exploiting the semantic information of feature maps at all scales and\nmaking the features have better global reasoning capabilities, while the\ndecoder part, we design a multi-scale asymmetric attention (MAA) module for\npreserving the semantic information at each encoder scale. The experiments show\nthat our approach achieves a better segmentation performance compared to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art method TransUnet with 105.7M parameters on both our\ncollected dataset and two other public datasets, with only 3.3M parameters.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Xiang He et.al.", "authors": "Xiang He,Weiye Song,Yiming Wang,Fabio Poiesi,Ji Yi,Manishi Desai,Quanqing Xu,Kongzheng Yang,Yi Wan", "id": "2404.16346v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16346v1", "repo": "null"}}

The experiments were performed on a version of TwiSty\ndataset including tweets written by the users of six different languages:\nPortuguese, French, Dutch, English, German, and Italian. Logistic regression\n(LR), and feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) with back-propagation were used\nto build models in two different settings: Inter-Lingual (IL) and Cross-Lingual\n(CL). In the IL setting, the training and testing were performed on the same\nlanguage whereas in the CL, Italian and German datasets were set aside and only\nused as test sets and the rest were combined to compose training and\ndevelopment sets. In the IL, the highest accuracy score belongs to LR whereas\nin the CL, FFNN with three hidden layers yields the highest score. The results\nshow that neural network based models underperform traditional models when the\nsize of the training set is small; however, they beat traditional models by a\nnon-trivial margin, when they are fed with large enough data. Finally, the\nfeature analysis confirms that men and women have different writing styles\nindependent of their language.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7d44\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u7528\u4f86\u9810\u6e2c Twitter \u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u6027\u5225\uff0c\u57fa\u790e\u662f\u5f9e\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63a8\u6587\u6587\u5b57\u4e2d\u8403\u53d6\u51fa\u7684\u8207\u8a9e\u8a00\u7121\u95dc\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\u3002\u9019\u4e9b\u5be6\u9a57\u662f\u5728 TwiSty \u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u516d\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u6240\u5beb\u7684\u63a8\u6587\uff1a\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8a9e\u3001\u6cd5\u8a9e\u3001\u8377\u862d\u8a9e\u3001\u82f1\u8a9e\u3001\u5fb7\u8a9e\u548c\u7fa9\u5927\u5229\u8a9e\u3002\u908f\u8f2f\u8ff4\u6b78 (LR) \u548c\u5e36\u53cd\u5411\u50b3\u64ad\u7684\u994b\u9001\u524d\u5411\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (FFNN) \u7528\u65bc\u5728\u5169\u7a2e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u8a9e\u8a00\u9593 (IL) \u548c\u8de8\u8a9e\u8a00 (CL)\u3002\u5728 IL \u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u6e2c\u8a66\u662f\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a9e\u8a00\u4e0a\u57f7\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5728 CL \u4e2d\uff0c\u7fa9\u5927\u5229\u8a9e\u548c\u5fb7\u8a9e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u50c5\u7528\u4f5c\u6e2c\u8a66\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u9918\u7684\u5247\u5408\u4f75\u7528\u65bc\u7d44\u6210\u8a13\u7df4\u548c\u958b\u767c\u96c6\u3002\u5728 IL \u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u5206\u6578\u5c6c\u65bc LR\uff0c\u800c\u5728 CL \u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e09\u500b\u96b1\u85cf\u5c64\u7684 FFNN \u7522\u751f\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u6578\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u7576\u8a13\u7df4\u96c6\u8f03\u5c0f\u6642\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u5982\u50b3\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7576\u5b83\u5011\u88ab\u8f38\u5165\u8db3\u5920\u5927\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u6642\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u6703\u4ee5\u975e\u986f\u8457\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u8d85\u8d8a\u50b3\u7d71\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u7279\u5fb5\u5206\u6790\u8b49\u5be6\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5beb\u4f5c\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u8207\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00\u7121\u95dc\u3002", "author": "Reyhaneh Hashempour et.al.", "authors": "Reyhaneh Hashempour, Barbara Plank, Aline Villavicencio, Renato Cordeiro de Amorim", "id": "2411.19733v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19733v1", "repo": "null"}}

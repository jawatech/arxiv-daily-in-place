##### **Region-specific Risk Quantification for Interpretable Prognosis of COVID-19**
2405.02815v1 by Zhusi Zhong, Jie Li, Zhuoqi Ma, Scott Collins, Harrison Bai, Paul Zhang, Terrance Healey, Xinbo Gao, Michael K. Atalay, Zhicheng Jiao

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global public health, necessitating
accurate diagnosis and intervention to control disease spread and reduce
mortality rates. This paper introduces an interpretable deep survival
prediction model designed specifically for improved understanding and trust in
COVID-19 prognosis using chest X-ray (CXR) images. By integrating a large-scale
pretrained image encoder, Risk-specific Grad-CAM, and anatomical region
detection techniques, our approach produces regional interpretable outcomes
that effectively capture essential disease features while focusing on rare but
critical abnormal regions. Our model's predictive results provide enhanced
clarity and transparency through risk area localization, enabling clinicians to
make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis with better understanding
of prognostic insights. We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-center
survival dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness via quantitative and
qualitative assessments, achieving superior C-indexes (0.764 and 0.727) and
time-dependent AUCs (0.799 and 0.691). These results suggest that our
explainable deep survival prediction model surpasses traditional survival
analysis methods in risk prediction, improving interpretability for clinical
decision making and enhancing AI system trustworthiness.

##### **M3H: Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare**
2404.18975v1 by Dimitris Bertsimas, Yu Ma

Recent breakthroughs in AI are poised to fundamentally enhance our study and
understanding of healthcare. The development of an integrated many-to-many
framework that leverages multiple data modality inputs for the analytical
modeling of multiple medical tasks, is critical for a unified understanding of
modern medicine. In this work, we introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal
Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning
from diverse multimodal inputs across a broad spectrum of medical task
categories and machine learning problem classes. The modular design of the
framework ensures its generalizable data processing, task definition, and rapid
model prototyping, applicable to both clinical and operational healthcare
settings. We evaluate the M3H framework by validating models trained from four
modalities (tabular, time-series, language, and vision) on 41 medical tasks
across 4 machine learning problem classes. Our results demonstrate that M3H
consistently produces multitask models that outperform canonical single-task
models (by 1.1- 37.2%) across 37 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments,
three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task: spanning
ML problem classes of supervised binary classification, multiclass
classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally, the framework
introduces a novel attention mechanism to balance self-exploitation (focus on
learning source task), and cross-exploration (encourage learning from other
tasks). Furthermore, M3H provides explainability insights on how joint learning
of additional tasks impacts the learning of source task using a proposed TIM
score, shedding light into the dynamics of task interdependencies. Its
adaptable architecture facilitates the customization and integration,
establishing it as a robust and scalable candidate solution for future
AI-driven healthcare systems.

##### **Advancing Healthcare Automation: Multi-Agent Systems for Medical Necessity Justification**
2404.17977v1 by Himanshu Pandey, Akhil Amod, Shivang

This paper explores the application of Swarm-Structured Multi-Agent Systems
(MAS) to establish medical necessity, a process that involves a systematic
review of patient-specific medical structured and unstructured data against
clinical guidelines. We addressed this complex task by decomposing it into
smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is handled by a specialized
AI agent. We conduct a systematic study of the impact of various prompting
strategies on these agents and benchmark different Large Language Models (LLMs)
to determine their accuracy in completing these tasks. Additionally, we
investigate how these agents can provide explainability, thereby enhancing
trust and transparency within the system.

##### **Rad4XCNN: a new agnostic method for post-hoc global explanation of CNN-derived features by means of radiomics**
2405.02334v1 by Francesco Prinzi, Carmelo Militello, Calogero Zarcaro, Tommaso Vincenzo Bartolotta, Salvatore Gaglio, Salvatore Vitabile

In the last years, artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical decision support
systems (CDSS) played a key role in harnessing machine learning and deep
learning architectures. Despite their promising capabilities, the lack of
transparency and explainability of AI models poses significant challenges,
particularly in medical contexts where reliability is a mandatory aspect.
Achieving transparency without compromising predictive accuracy remains a key
challenge. This paper presents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the
predictive power of CNN-derived features with the interpretability inherent in
radiomic features. Rad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on
saliency map, by associating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by
means of Radiomics, offering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond
visualization maps. Using a breast cancer classification task as a case study,
we evaluated Rad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online
dataset and two in-house datasets for internal and external validation. Some
key results are: i) CNN-derived features guarantee more robust accuracy when
compared against ViT-derived and radiomic features; ii) conventional
visualization map methods for explanation present several pitfalls; iii)
Rad4XCNN does not sacrifice model accuracy for their explainability; iv)
Rad4XCNN provides global explanation insights enabling the physician to analyze
the model outputs and findings. In addition, we highlight the importance of
integrating interpretability into AI models for enhanced trust and adoption in
clinical practice, emphasizing how our method can mitigate some concerns
related to explainable AI methods.

##### **Attributing Responsibility in AI-Induced Incidents: A Computational Reflective Equilibrium Framework for Accountability**
2404.16957v1 by Yunfei Ge, Quanyan Zhu

The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced
complex challenges in the responsibility and accountability in the event of
incidents involving AI-enabled systems. The interconnectivity of these systems,
ethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI
technology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional
responsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a
Computational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and
ethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders.
The computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the
limitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted
scenarios, showcasing the framework's explainability, coherence, and adaptivity
properties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal
role of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium
computation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case
study, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse
responsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into
accountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a
sustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and
reflection.

##### **Explainable AI for Fair Sepsis Mortality Predictive Model**
2404.13139v1 by Chia-Hsuan Chang, Xiaoyang Wang, Christopher C. Yang

Artificial intelligence supports healthcare professionals with predictive
modeling, greatly transforming clinical decision-making. This study addresses
the crucial need for fairness and explainability in AI applications within
healthcare to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient demographics. By
focusing on the predictive modeling of sepsis-related mortality, we propose a
method that learns a performance-optimized predictive model and then employs
the transfer learning process to produce a model with better fairness. Our
method also introduces a novel permutation-based feature importance algorithm
aiming at elucidating the contribution of each feature in enhancing fairness on
predictions. Unlike existing explainability methods concentrating on explaining
feature contribution to predictive performance, our proposed method uniquely
bridges the gap in understanding how each feature contributes to fairness. This
advancement is pivotal, given sepsis's significant mortality rate and its role
in one-third of hospital deaths. Our method not only aids in identifying and
mitigating biases within the predictive model but also fosters trust among
healthcare stakeholders by improving the transparency and fairness of model
predictions, thereby contributing to more equitable and trustworthy healthcare
delivery.

##### **Multi Class Depression Detection Through Tweets using Artificial Intelligence**
2404.13104v1 by Muhammad Osama Nusrat, Waseem Shahzad, Saad Ahmed Jamal

Depression is a significant issue nowadays. As per the World Health
Organization (WHO), in 2023, over 280 million individuals are grappling with
depression. This is a huge number; if not taken seriously, these numbers will
increase rapidly. About 4.89 billion individuals are social media users. People
express their feelings and emotions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook,
Reddit, Instagram, etc. These platforms contain valuable information which can
be used for research purposes. Considerable research has been conducted across
various social media platforms. However, certain limitations persist in these
endeavors. Particularly, previous studies were only focused on detecting
depression and the intensity of depression in tweets. Also, there existed
inaccuracies in dataset labeling. In this research work, five types of
depression (Bipolar, major, psychotic, atypical, and postpartum) were predicted
using tweets from the Twitter database based on lexicon labeling. Explainable
AI was used to provide reasoning by highlighting the parts of tweets that
represent type of depression. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) was used for feature extraction and training. Machine
learning and deep learning methodologies were used to train the model. The BERT
model presented the most promising results, achieving an overall accuracy of
0.96.

##### **COIN: Counterfactual inpainting for weakly supervised semantic segmentation for medical images**
2404.12832v1 by Dmytro Shvetsov, Joonas Ariva, Marharyta Domnich, Raul Vicente, Dmytro Fishman

Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and
radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images,
including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of
deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by
the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the
capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through
the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations.
The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting
approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to
normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an
input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the
generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the
classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce
precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing
segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are
substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and
actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in
Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established
attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an
alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al. This
evidence suggests that COIN is a promising approach for semantic segmentation
of tumors in CT images, and presents a step forward in making deep learning
applications more accessible and effective in healthcare, where annotated data
is scarce.

##### **Advancements in Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis**
2404.07239v1 by Milad Yousefi, Shadi Farabi Maleki, Ali Jafarizadeh, Mahya Ahmadpour Youshanlui, Aida Jafari, Siamak Pedrammehr, Roohallah Alizadehsani, Ryszard Tadeusiewicz, Pawel Plawiak

Thyroid cancer is an increasing global health concern that requires advanced
diagnostic methods. The application of AI and radiomics to thyroid cancer
diagnosis is examined in this review. A review of multiple databases was
conducted in compliance with PRISMA guidelines until October 2023. A
combination of keywords led to the discovery of an English academic publication
on thyroid cancer and related subjects. 267 papers were returned from the
original search after 109 duplicates were removed. Relevant studies were
selected according to predetermined criteria after 124 articles were eliminated
based on an examination of their abstract and title. After the comprehensive
analysis, an additional six studies were excluded. Among the 28 included
studies, radiomics analysis, which incorporates ultrasound (US) images,
demonstrated its effectiveness in diagnosing thyroid cancer. Various results
were noted, some of the studies presenting new strategies that outperformed the
status quo. The literature has emphasized various challenges faced by AI
models, including interpretability issues, dataset constraints, and operator
dependence. The synthesized findings of the 28 included studies mentioned the
need for standardization efforts and prospective multicenter studies to address
these concerns. Furthermore, approaches to overcome these obstacles were
identified, such as advances in explainable AI technology and personalized
medicine techniques. The review focuses on how AI and radiomics could transform
the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Despite challenges, future
research on multidisciplinary cooperation, clinical applicability validation,
and algorithm improvement holds the potential to improve patient outcomes and
diagnostic precision in the treatment of thyroid cancer.

##### **Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Classification in the Context of Bangladeshi Patients: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach with Explainable AI**
2404.04686v1 by Taminul Islam, Md. Alif Sheakh, Mst. Sazia Tahosin, Most. Hasna Hena, Shopnil Akash, Yousef A. Bin Jardan, Gezahign Fentahun Wondmie, Hiba-Allah Nafidi, Mohammed Bourhia

Breast cancer has rapidly increased in prevalence in recent years, making it
one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Among all cancers, it is by
far the most common. Diagnosing this illness manually requires significant time
and expertise. Since detecting breast cancer is a time-consuming process,
preventing its further spread can be aided by creating machine-based forecasts.
Machine learning and Explainable AI are crucial in classification as they not
only provide accurate predictions but also offer insights into how the model
arrives at its decisions, aiding in the understanding and trustworthiness of
the classification results. In this study, we evaluate and compare the
classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 scores of five different
machine learning methods using a primary dataset (500 patients from Dhaka
Medical College Hospital). Five different supervised machine learning
techniques, including decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, naive
bayes, and XGBoost, have been used to achieve optimal results on our dataset.
Additionally, this study applied SHAP analysis to the XGBoost model to
interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of each feature on
the model's output. We compared the accuracy with which several algorithms
classified the data, as well as contrasted with other literature in this field.
After final evaluation, this study found that XGBoost achieved the best model
accuracy, which is 97%.

##### **Enhancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Mammography: Evaluation and Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks and Explainable AI**
2404.03892v3 by Maryam Ahmed, Tooba Bibi, Rizwan Ahmed Khan, Sidra Nasir

The Deep learning (DL) models for diagnosing breast cancer from mammographic
images often operate as "black boxes", making it difficult for healthcare
professionals to trust and understand their decision-making processes. The
study presents an integrated framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the enhanced diagnosis
of breast cancer using the CBIS-DDSM dataset. The methodology encompasses an
elaborate data preprocessing pipeline and advanced data augmentation techniques
to counteract dataset limitations and transfer learning using pre-trained
networks such as VGG-16, Inception-V3 and ResNet was employed. A focal point of
our study is the evaluation of XAI's effectiveness in interpreting model
predictions, highlighted by utilizing the Hausdorff measure to assess the
alignment between AI-generated explanations and expert annotations
quantitatively. This approach is critical for XAI in promoting trustworthiness
and ethical fairness in AI-assisted diagnostics. The findings from our research
illustrate the effective collaboration between CNNs and XAI in advancing
diagnostic methods for breast cancer, thereby facilitating a more seamless
integration of advanced AI technologies within clinical settings. By enhancing
the interpretability of AI driven decisions, this work lays the groundwork for
improved collaboration between AI systems and medical practitioners, ultimately
enriching patient care. Furthermore, the implications of our research extended
well beyond the current methodologies. It encourages further research into how
to combine multimodal data and improve AI explanations to meet the needs of
clinical practice.

##### **Addressing Social Misattributions of Large Language Models: An HCXAI-based Approach**
2403.17873v1 by Andrea Ferrario, Alberto Termine, Alessandro Facchini

Human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) advocates for the integration of social
aspects into AI explanations. Central to the HCXAI discourse is the Social
Transparency (ST) framework, which aims to make the socio-organizational
context of AI systems accessible to their users. In this work, we suggest
extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in
Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental
health. In fact LLMs, which are remarkably capable of simulating roles and
personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users'
perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and
dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To
address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth
'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by
its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM
capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible
development and use of LLM-based technology.

##### **Clinical Domain Knowledge-Derived Template Improves Post Hoc AI Explanations in Pneumothorax Classification**
2403.18871v1 by Han Yuan, Chuan Hong, Pengtao Jiang, Gangming Zhao, Nguyen Tuan Anh Tran, Xinxing Xu, Yet Yen Yan, Nan Liu

Background: Pneumothorax is an acute thoracic disease caused by abnormal air
collection between the lungs and chest wall. To address the opaqueness often
associated with deep learning (DL) models, explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been introduced to outline regions related to pneumothorax
diagnoses made by DL models. However, these explanations sometimes diverge from
actual lesion areas, highlighting the need for further improvement. Method: We
propose a template-guided approach to incorporate the clinical knowledge of
pneumothorax into model explanations generated by XAI methods, thereby
enhancing the quality of these explanations. Utilizing one lesion delineation
created by radiologists, our approach first generates a template that
represents potential areas of pneumothorax occurrence. This template is then
superimposed on model explanations to filter out extraneous explanations that
fall outside the template's boundaries. To validate its efficacy, we carried
out a comparative analysis of three XAI methods with and without our template
guidance when explaining two DL models in two real-world datasets. Results: The
proposed approach consistently improved baseline XAI methods across twelve
benchmark scenarios built on three XAI methods, two DL models, and two
datasets. The average incremental percentages, calculated by the performance
improvements over the baseline performance, were 97.8% in Intersection over
Union (IoU) and 94.1% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) when comparing model
explanations and ground-truth lesion areas. Conclusions: In the context of
pneumothorax diagnoses, we proposed a template-guided approach for improving AI
explanations. We anticipate that our template guidance will forge a fresh
approach to elucidating AI models by integrating clinical domain expertise.

##### **Enhancing Neural Machine Translation of Low-Resource Languages: Corpus Development, Human Evaluation and Explainable AI Architectures**
2403.01580v1 by Séamus Lankford

In the current machine translation (MT) landscape, the Transformer
architecture stands out as the gold standard, especially for high-resource
language pairs. This research delves into its efficacy for low-resource
language pairs including both the English$\leftrightarrow$Irish and
English$\leftrightarrow$Marathi language pairs. Notably, the study identifies
the optimal hyperparameters and subword model type to significantly improve the
translation quality of Transformer models for low-resource language pairs.
  The scarcity of parallel datasets for low-resource languages can hinder MT
development. To address this, gaHealth was developed, the first bilingual
corpus of health data for the Irish language. Focusing on the health domain,
models developed using this in-domain dataset exhibited very significant
improvements in BLEU score when compared with models from the LoResMT2021
Shared Task. A subsequent human evaluation using the multidimensional quality
metrics error taxonomy showcased the superior performance of the Transformer
system in reducing both accuracy and fluency errors compared to an RNN-based
counterpart.
  Furthermore, this thesis introduces adaptNMT and adaptMLLM, two open-source
applications streamlined for the development, fine-tuning, and deployment of
neural machine translation models. These tools considerably simplify the setup
and evaluation process, making MT more accessible to both developers and
translators. Notably, adaptNMT, grounded in the OpenNMT ecosystem, promotes
eco-friendly natural language processing research by highlighting the
environmental footprint of model development. Fine-tuning of MLLMs by adaptMLLM
demonstrated advancements in translation performance for two low-resource
language pairs: English$\leftrightarrow$Irish and
English$\leftrightarrow$Marathi, compared to baselines from the LoResMT2021
Shared Task.

##### **Artificial Intelligence and Diabetes Mellitus: An Inside Look Through the Retina**
2402.18600v1 by Yasin Sadeghi Bazargani, Majid Mirzaei, Navid Sobhi, Mirsaeed Abdollahi, Ali Jafarizadeh, Siamak Pedrammehr, Roohallah Alizadehsani, Ru San Tan, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam, U. Rajendra Acharya

Diabetes mellitus (DM) predisposes patients to vascular complications.
Retinal images and vasculature reflect the body's micro- and macrovascular
health. They can be used to diagnose DM complications, including diabetic
retinopathy (DR), neuropathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease, as well as forecast the risk of cardiovascular events. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-enabled systems developed for high-throughput detection of DR
using digitized retinal images have become clinically adopted. Beyond DR
screening, AI integration also holds immense potential to address challenges
associated with the holistic care of the patient with DM. In this work, we aim
to comprehensively review the literature for studies on AI applications based
on retinal images related to DM diagnosis, prognostication, and management. We
will describe the findings of holistic AI-assisted diabetes care, including but
not limited to DR screening, and discuss barriers to implementing such systems,
including issues concerning ethics, data privacy, equitable access, and
explainability. With the ability to evaluate the patient's health status vis a
vis DM complication as well as risk prognostication of future cardiovascular
complications, AI-assisted retinal image analysis has the potential to become a
central tool for modern personalized medicine in patients with DM.

##### **Multi-stakeholder Perspective on Responsible Artificial Intelligence and Acceptability in Education**
2402.15027v2 by A. J. Karran, P. Charland, J-T. Martineau, A. Ortiz de Guinea Lopez de Arana, AM. Lesage, S. Senecal, P-M. Leger

This study investigates the acceptability of different artificial
intelligence (AI) applications in education from a multi-stakeholder
perspective, including students, teachers, and parents. Acknowledging the
transformative potential of AI in education, it addresses concerns related to
data privacy, AI agency, transparency, explainability and the ethical
deployment of AI. Through a vignette methodology, participants were presented
with four scenarios where AI's agency, transparency, explainability, and
privacy were manipulated. After each scenario, participants completed a survey
that captured their perceptions of AI's global utility, individual usefulness,
justice, confidence, risk, and intention to use each scenario's AI if
available. The data collection comprising a final sample of 1198
multi-stakeholder participants was distributed through a partner institution
and social media campaigns and focused on individual responses to four AI use
cases. A mediation analysis of the data indicated that acceptance and trust in
AI varies significantly across stakeholder groups. We found that the key
mediators between high and low levels of AI's agency, transparency, and
explainability, as well as the intention to use the different educational AI,
included perceived global utility, justice, and confidence. The study
highlights that the acceptance of AI in education is a nuanced and multifaceted
issue that requires careful consideration of specific AI applications and their
characteristics, in addition to the diverse stakeholders' perceptions.

##### **Deciphering Heartbeat Signatures: A Vision Transformer Approach to Explainable Atrial Fibrillation Detection from ECG Signals**
2402.09474v2 by Aruna Mohan, Danne Elbers, Or Zilbershot, Fatemeh Afghah, David Vorchheimer

Remote patient monitoring based on wearable single-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG) devices has significant potential for enabling the early detection of
heart disease, especially in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)
approaches for automated heart disease detection. There have been prior studies
applying AI approaches based on deep learning for heart disease detection.
However, these models are yet to be widely accepted as a reliable aid for
clinical diagnostics, in part due to the current black-box perception
surrounding many AI algorithms. In particular, there is a need to identify the
key features of the ECG signal that contribute toward making an accurate
diagnosis, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. In the present
study, we develop a vision transformer approach to identify atrial fibrillation
based on single-lead ECG data. A residual network (ResNet) approach is also
developed for comparison with the vision transformer approach. These models are
applied to the Chapman-Shaoxing dataset to classify atrial fibrillation, as
well as another common arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and normal sinus rhythm
heartbeats. The models enable the identification of the key regions of the
heartbeat that determine the resulting classification, and highlight the
importance of P-waves and T-waves, as well as heartbeat duration and signal
amplitude, in distinguishing normal sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and
sinus bradycardia.

##### **Illuminate: A novel approach for depression detection with explainable analysis and proactive therapy using prompt engineering**
2402.05127v1 by Aryan Agrawal

This paper introduces a novel paradigm for depression detection and treatment
using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer
4 (GPT-4), Llama 2 chat, and Gemini. These LLMs are fine-tuned with specialized
prompts to diagnose, explain, and suggest therapeutic interventions for
depression. A unique few-shot prompting method enhances the models' ability to
analyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM-5 criteria. In the
interaction phase, the models engage in empathetic dialogue management, drawing
from resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide,
fostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major
depressive disorders. Additionally, the research introduces the Illuminate
Database, enriched with various CBT modules, aiding in personalized therapy
recommendations. The study evaluates LLM performance using metrics such as F1
scores, Precision, Recall, Cosine similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy
for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) across different test sets, demonstrating their
effectiveness. This comprehensive approach blends cutting-edge AI with
established psychological methods, offering new possibilities in mental health
care and showcasing the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing depression
diagnosis and treatment strategies.

##### **Information That Matters: Exploring Information Needs of People Affected by Algorithmic Decisions**
2401.13324v4 by Timothée Schmude, Laura Koesten, Torsten Möller, Sebastian Tschiatschek

Explanations of AI systems rarely address the information needs of people
affected by algorithmic decision-making (ADM). This gap between conveyed
information and information that matters to affected stakeholders can impede
understanding and adherence to regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. To
address this gap, we present the "XAI Novice Question Bank": A catalog of
affected stakeholders' information needs in two ADM use cases (employment
prediction and health monitoring), covering the categories data, system
context, system usage, and system specifications. Information needs were
gathered in an interview study where participants received explanations in
response to their inquiries. Participants further reported their understanding
and decision confidence, showing that while confidence tended to increase after
receiving explanations, participants also met understanding challenges, such as
being unable to tell why their understanding felt incomplete. Explanations
further influenced participants' perceptions of the systems' risks and
benefits, which they confirmed or changed depending on the use case. When risks
were perceived as high, participants expressed particular interest in
explanations about intention, such as why and to what end a system was put in
place. With this work, we aim to support the inclusion of affected stakeholders
into explainability by contributing an overview of information and challenges
relevant to them when deciding on the adoption of ADM systems. We close by
summarizing our findings in a list of six key implications that inform the
design of future explanations for affected stakeholder audiences.

##### **Evaluating Large Language Models on the GMAT: Implications for the Future of Business Education**
2401.02985v1 by Vahid Ashrafimoghari, Necdet Gürkan, Jordan W. Suchow

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the domain
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, has opened new avenues for
application across various fields, yet its role in business education remains
underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the
performance of seven major LLMs, OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and
GPT-4 Turbo), Google's models (PaLM 2, Gemini 1.0 Pro), and Anthropic's models
(Claude 2 and Claude 2.1), on the GMAT, which is a key exam in the admission
process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs
outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other
models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top
business schools. Through a case study, this research examines GPT-4 Turbo's
ability to explain answers, evaluate responses, identify errors, tailor
instructions, and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions,
GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, and Gemini 1.0 Pro, show marked improvements in
reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors, underscoring their potential
for complex problem-solving. While AI's promise in education, assessment, and
tutoring is clear, challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs'
academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and
application of AI in education. As AI technology advances, it is imperative to
establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction, verify the accuracy of
AI-generated content, ensure worldwide access for diverse learners, and create
an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research
sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich
educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.

##### **XAI for In-hospital Mortality Prediction via Multimodal ICU Data**
2312.17624v1 by Xingqiao Li, Jindong Gu, Zhiyong Wang, Yancheng Yuan, Bo Du, Fengxiang He

Predicting in-hospital mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is
key to final clinical outcomes. AI has shown advantaged accuracy but suffers
from the lack of explainability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an
eXplainable Multimodal Mortality Predictor (X-MMP) approaching an efficient,
explainable AI solution for predicting in-hospital mortality via multimodal ICU
data. We employ multimodal learning in our framework, which can receive
heterogeneous inputs from clinical data and make decisions. Furthermore, we
introduce an explainable method, namely Layer-Wise Propagation to Transformer,
as a proper extension of the LRP method to Transformers, producing explanations
over multimodal inputs and revealing the salient features attributed to
prediction. Moreover, the contribution of each modality to clinical outcomes
can be visualized, assisting clinicians in understanding the reasoning behind
decision-making. We construct a multimodal dataset based on MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve
reasonable interpretation with competitive prediction accuracy. In particular,
our framework can be easily transferred to other clinical tasks, which
facilitates the discovery of crucial factors in healthcare research.

Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) methods in pathology have
advanced substantially. However, integration into routine clinical practice has
been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory
hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and
the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA
initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's
achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the
pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry.
In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards,
recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability
methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and
successfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different
vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized
interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real
clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia.
In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders
to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial,
clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source
interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and
streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and
broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a
sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International,
has been established to continue standardization and support broad
implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.

##### **Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual Explanations**
2312.11747v2 by Mario Alfonso Prado-Romero, Bardh Prenkaj, Giovanni Stilo

Counterfactual Explanation (CE) techniques have garnered attention as a means
to provide insights to the users engaging with AI systems. While extensively
researched in domains such as medical imaging and autonomous vehicles, Graph
Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) methods have been comparatively
under-explored. GCEs generate a new graph similar to the original one, with a
different outcome grounded on the underlying predictive model. Among these GCE
techniques, those rooted in generative mechanisms have received relatively
limited investigation despite demonstrating impressive accomplishments in other
domains, such as artistic styles and natural language modelling. The preference
for generative explainers stems from their capacity to generate counterfactual
instances during inference, leveraging autonomously acquired perturbations of
the input graph. Motivated by the rationales above, our study introduces
RSGG-CE, a novel Robust Stochastic Graph Generator for Counterfactual
Explanations able to produce counterfactual examples from the learned latent
space considering a partially ordered generation sequence. Furthermore, we
undertake quantitative and qualitative analyses to compare RSGG-CE's
performance against SoA generative explainers, highlighting its increased
ability to engendering plausible counterfactual candidates.

##### **Evaluating the Utility of Model Explanations for Model Development**
2312.06032v1 by Shawn Im, Jacob Andreas, Yilun Zhou

One of the motivations for explainable AI is to allow humans to make better
and more informed decisions regarding the use and deployment of AI models. But
careful evaluations are needed to assess whether this expectation has been
fulfilled. Current evaluations mainly focus on algorithmic properties of
explanations, and those that involve human subjects often employ subjective
questions to test human's perception of explanation usefulness, without being
grounded in objective metrics and measurements. In this work, we evaluate
whether explanations can improve human decision-making in practical scenarios
of machine learning model development. We conduct a mixed-methods user study
involving image data to evaluate saliency maps generated by SmoothGrad,
GradCAM, and an oracle explanation on two tasks: model selection and
counterfactual simulation. To our surprise, we did not find evidence of
significant improvement on these tasks when users were provided with any of the
saliency maps, even the synthetic oracle explanation designed to be simple to
understand and highly indicative of the answer. Nonetheless, explanations did
help users more accurately describe the models. These findings suggest caution
regarding the usefulness and potential for misunderstanding in saliency-based
explanations.

##### **Building Trustworthy NeuroSymbolic AI Systems: Consistency, Reliability, Explainability, and Safety**
2312.06798v1 by Manas Gaur, Amit Sheth

Explainability and Safety engender Trust. These require a model to exhibit
consistency and reliability. To achieve these, it is necessary to use and
analyze data and knowledge with statistical and symbolic AI methods relevant to
the AI application - neither alone will do. Consequently, we argue and seek to
demonstrate that the NeuroSymbolic AI approach is better suited for making AI a
trusted AI system. We present the CREST framework that shows how Consistency,
Reliability, user-level Explainability, and Safety are built on NeuroSymbolic
methods that use data and knowledge to support requirements for critical
applications such as health and well-being. This article focuses on Large
Language Models (LLMs) as the chosen AI system within the CREST framework. LLMs
have garnered substantial attention from researchers due to their versatility
in handling a broad array of natural language processing (NLP) scenarios. For
example, ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM have emerged as highly promising
platforms for providing information in general and health-related queries,
respectively. Nevertheless, these models remain black boxes despite
incorporating human feedback and instruction-guided tuning. For instance,
ChatGPT can generate unsafe responses despite instituting safety guardrails.
CREST presents a plausible approach harnessing procedural and graph-based
knowledge within a NeuroSymbolic framework to shed light on the challenges
associated with LLMs.

##### **Deployment of a Robust and Explainable Mortality Prediction Model: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond**
2311.17133v1 by Jacob R. Epifano, Stephen Glass, Ravi P. Ramachandran, Sharad Patel, Aaron J. Masino, Ghulam Rasool

This study investigated the performance, explainability, and robustness of
deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models in predicting mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The first study of its kind, we found that
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and intelligent training techniques allowed our
models to maintain performance amidst significant data shifts. Our results
emphasize the importance of developing robust AI models capable of matching or
surpassing clinician predictions, even under challenging conditions. Our
exploration of model explainability revealed that stochastic models generate
more diverse and personalized explanations thereby highlighting the need for AI
models that provide detailed and individualized insights in real-world clinical
settings. Furthermore, we underscored the importance of quantifying uncertainty
in AI models which enables clinicians to make better-informed decisions based
on reliable predictions. Our study advocates for prioritizing implementation
science in AI research for healthcare and ensuring that AI solutions are
practical, beneficial, and sustainable in real-world clinical environments. By
addressing unique challenges and complexities in healthcare settings,
researchers can develop AI models that effectively improve clinical practice
and patient outcomes.

##### **Variational Autoencoders for Feature Exploration and Malignancy Prediction of Lung Lesions**
2311.15719v1 by Benjamin Keel, Aaron Quyn, David Jayne, Samuel D. Relton

Lung cancer is responsible for 21% of cancer deaths in the UK and five-year
survival rates are heavily influenced by the stage the cancer was identified
at. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of AI methods for accurate
and early diagnosis of lung cancer from routine scans. However, this evidence
has not translated into clinical practice with one barrier being a lack of
interpretable models. This study investigates the application Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions.
Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the
LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced
by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used
in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved
state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows
the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions
based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient
and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard
Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces
the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent
space with disentangled feature representation. Finally, we demonstrate the
potential for latent space traversals corresponding to clinically meaningful
feature changes.

##### **MRxaI: Black-Box Explainability for Image Classifiers in a Medical Setting**
2311.14471v1 by Nathan Blake, Hana Chockler, David A. Kelly, Santiago Calderon Pena, Akchunya Chanchal

Existing tools for explaining the output of image classifiers can be divided
into white-box, which rely on access to the model internals, and black-box,
agnostic to the model. As the usage of AI in the medical domain grows, so too
does the usage of explainability tools. Existing work on medical image
explanations focuses on white-box tools, such as gradcam. However, there are
clear advantages to switching to a black-box tool, including the ability to use
it with any classifier and the wide selection of black-box tools available. On
standard images, black-box tools are as precise as white-box. In this paper we
compare the performance of several black-box methods against gradcam on a brain
cancer MRI dataset. We demonstrate that most black-box tools are not suitable
for explaining medical image classifications and present a detailed analysis of
the reasons for their shortcomings. We also show that one black-box tool, a
causal explainability-based rex, performs as well as \gradcam.

##### **Moderating Model Marketplaces: Platform Governance Puzzles for AI Intermediaries**
2311.12573v2 by Robert Gorwa, Michael Veale

The AI development community is increasingly making use of hosting
intermediaries such as Hugging Face provide easy access to user-uploaded models
and training data. These model marketplaces lower technical deployment barriers
for hundreds of thousands of users, yet can be used in numerous potentially
harmful and illegal ways. In this article, we explain ways in which AI systems,
which can both `contain' content and be open-ended tools, present one of the
trickiest platform governance challenges seen to date. We provide case studies
of several incidents across three illustrative platforms -- Hugging Face,
GitHub and Civitai -- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models.
Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited)
practices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands:
licensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open
policy development. While the policy challenge at hand is a considerable one,
we conclude with some ideas as to how platforms could better mobilize resources
to act as a careful, fair, and proportionate regulatory access point.

##### **Ovarian Cancer Data Analysis using Deep Learning: A Systematic Review from the Perspectives of Key Features of Data Analysis and AI Assurance**
2311.11932v1 by Muta Tah Hira, Mohammad A. Razzaque, Mosharraf Sarker

Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep
Learning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and
cancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data
sets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been
published. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer
(e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features.
However, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these
features and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review
aims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying
important aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key
features and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used
to conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies
published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the
analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were
examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven
ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on
detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention
of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse
population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country.
- Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated
analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a
mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and
diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and -
The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only
2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability.

##### **Representing visual classification as a linear combination of words**
2311.10933v1 by Shobhit Agarwal, Yevgeniy R. Semenov, William Lotter

Explainability is a longstanding challenge in deep learning, especially in
high-stakes domains like healthcare. Common explainability methods highlight
image regions that drive an AI model's decision. Humans, however, heavily rely
on language to convey explanations of not only "where" but "what".
Additionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI
predictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in
general. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing,
and potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in
novel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a
vision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual
classification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between
images and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear
combination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its
alignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two
medical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting
descriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of
domain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the
potential for 'shortcut connections' in the public datasets used. Towards a
functional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we
find that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a
specialized medical task at a non-trivial level. Altogether, our results
emphasize the potential of using multimodal foundational models to deliver
intuitive, language-based explanations of visual tasks.

##### **Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in medical imaging AI**
2311.02115v1 by Emma A. M. Stanley, Raissa Souza, Anthony Winder, Vedant Gulve, Kimberly Amador, Matthias Wilms, Nils D. Forkert

Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical
tasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between
subgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data
are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those
biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at
ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel
analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact
of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this
framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical
imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with
known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by
using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated
bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the
efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the
simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the
CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified
as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we
demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the
manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI
models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of
biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a
novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation
strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of
clinical AI that is robust and responsible.

##### **Predicting recovery following stroke: deep learning, multimodal data and feature selection using explainable AI**
2310.19174v1 by Adam White, Margarita Saranti, Artur d'Avila Garcez, Thomas M. H. Hope, Cathy J. Price, Howard Bowman

Machine learning offers great potential for automated prediction of
post-stroke symptoms and their response to rehabilitation. Major challenges for
this endeavour include the very high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, the
relatively small size of the datasets available for learning, and how to
effectively combine neuroimaging and tabular data (e.g. demographic information
and clinical characteristics). This paper evaluates several solutions based on
two strategies. The first is to use 2D images that summarise MRI scans. The
second is to select key features that improve classification accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce the novel approach of training a convolutional
neural network (CNN) on images that combine regions-of-interest extracted from
MRIs, with symbolic representations of tabular data. We evaluate a series of
CNN architectures (both 2D and a 3D) that are trained on different
representations of MRI and tabular data, to predict whether a composite measure
of post-stroke spoken picture description ability is in the aphasic or
non-aphasic range. MRI and tabular data were acquired from 758 English speaking
stroke survivors who participated in the PLORAS study. The classification
accuracy for a baseline logistic regression was 0.678 for lesion size alone,
rising to 0.757 and 0.813 when initial symptom severity and recovery time were
successively added. The highest classification accuracy 0.854 was observed when
8 regions-of-interest was extracted from each MRI scan and combined with lesion
size, initial severity and recovery time in a 2D Residual Neural Network.Our
findings demonstrate how imaging and tabular data can be combined for high
post-stroke classification accuracy, even when the dataset is small in machine
learning terms. We conclude by proposing how the current models could be
improved to achieve even higher levels of accuracy using images from hospital
scanners.

##### **Trainable Noise Model as an XAI evaluation method: application on Sobol for remote sensing image segmentation**
2310.01828v2 by Hossein Shreim, Abdul Karim Gizzini, Ali J. Ghandour

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as an essential
requirement when dealing with mission-critical applications, ensuring
transparency and interpretability of the employed black box AI models. The
significance of XAI spans various domains, from healthcare to finance, where
understanding the decision-making process of deep learning algorithms is
essential. Most AI-based computer vision models are often black boxes; hence,
providing explainability of deep neural networks in image processing is crucial
for their wide adoption and deployment in medical image analysis, autonomous
driving, and remote sensing applications. Recently, several XAI methods for
image classification tasks have been introduced. On the contrary, image
segmentation has received comparatively less attention in the context of
explainability, although it is a fundamental task in computer vision
applications, especially in remote sensing. Only some research proposes
gradient-based XAI algorithms for image segmentation. This paper adapts the
recent gradient-free Sobol XAI method for semantic segmentation. To measure the
performance of the Sobol method for segmentation, we propose a quantitative XAI
evaluation method based on a learnable noise model. The main objective of this
model is to induce noise on the explanation maps, where higher induced noise
signifies low accuracy and vice versa. A benchmark analysis is conducted to
evaluate and compare performance of three XAI methods, including Seg-Grad-CAM,
Seg-Grad-CAM++ and Seg-Sobol using the proposed noise-based evaluation
technique. This constitutes the first attempt to run and evaluate XAI methods
using high-resolution satellite images.

##### **Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI**
2311.01463v1 by Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, Ilker Yaramis, Taposh Dutta Roy

Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short
period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare
domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and
hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers
have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key
to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these
models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this
paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and
unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare.
Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of
hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future
of LLMs in healthcare may look like.

##### **When to Trust AI: Advances and Challenges for Certification of Neural Networks**
2309.11196v1 by Marta Kwiatkowska, Xiyue Zhang

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been advancing at a fast pace and it is now
poised for deployment in a wide range of applications, such as autonomous
systems, medical diagnosis and natural language processing. Early adoption of
AI technology for real-world applications has not been without problems,
particularly for neural networks, which may be unstable and susceptible to
adversarial examples. In the longer term, appropriate safety assurance
techniques need to be developed to reduce potential harm due to avoidable
system failures and ensure trustworthiness. Focusing on certification and
explainability, this paper provides an overview of techniques that have been
developed to ensure safety of AI decisions and discusses future challenges.

##### **Functional requirements to mitigate the Risk of Harm to Patients from Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**
2309.10424v1 by Juan M. García-Gómez, Vicent Blanes-Selva, José Carlos de Bartolomé Cenzano, Jaime Cebolla-Cornejo, Ascensión Doñate-Martínez

The Directorate General for Parliamentary Research Services of the European
Parliament has prepared a report to the Members of the European Parliament
where they enumerate seven main risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
medicine and healthcare: patient harm due to AI errors, misuse of medical AI
tools, bias in AI and the perpetuation of existing inequities, lack of
transparency, privacy and security issues, gaps in accountability, and
obstacles in implementation.
  In this study, we propose fourteen functional requirements that AI systems
may implement to reduce the risks associated with their medical purpose: AI
passport, User management, Regulation check, Academic use only disclaimer, data
quality assessment, Clinicians double check, Continuous performance evaluation,
Audit trail, Continuous usability test, Review of retrospective/simulated
cases, Bias check, eXplainable AI, Encryption and use of field-tested
libraries, and Semantic interoperability.
  Our intention here is to provide specific high-level specifications of
technical solutions to ensure continuous good performance and use of AI systems
to benefit patients in compliance with the future EU regulatory framework.

##### **QXAI: Explainable AI Framework for Quantitative Analysis in Patient Monitoring Systems**
2309.10293v3 by Thanveer Shaik, Xiaohui Tao, Haoran Xie, Lin Li, Juan D. Velasquez, Niall Higgins

Artificial Intelligence techniques can be used to classify a patient's
physical activities and predict vital signs for remote patient monitoring.
Regression analysis based on non-linear models like deep learning models has
limited explainability due to its black-box nature. This can require
decision-makers to make blind leaps of faith based on non-linear model results,
especially in healthcare applications. In non-invasive monitoring, patient data
from tracking sensors and their predisposing clinical attributes act as input
features for predicting future vital signs. Explaining the contributions of
various features to the overall output of the monitoring application is
critical for a clinician's decision-making. In this study, an Explainable AI
for Quantitative analysis (QXAI) framework is proposed with post-hoc model
explainability and intrinsic explainability for regression and classification
tasks in a supervised learning approach. This was achieved by utilizing the
Shapley values concept and incorporating attention mechanisms in deep learning
models. We adopted the artificial neural networks (ANN) and attention-based
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models for the prediction of heart rate and
classification of physical activities based on sensor data. The deep learning
models achieved state-of-the-art results in both prediction and classification
tasks. Global explanation and local explanation were conducted on input data to
understand the feature contribution of various patient data. The proposed QXAI
framework was evaluated using PPG-DaLiA data to predict heart rate and mobile
health (MHEALTH) data to classify physical activities based on sensor data.
Monte Carlo approximation was applied to the framework to overcome the time
complexity and high computation power requirements required for Shapley value
calculations.

##### **Evaluation of Human-Understandability of Global Model Explanations using Decision Tree**
2309.09917v1 by Adarsa Sivaprasad, Ehud Reiter, Nava Tintarev, Nir Oren

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) research, the predominant focus
has been on interpreting models for experts and practitioners. Model agnostic
and local explanation approaches are deemed interpretable and sufficient in
many applications. However, in domains like healthcare, where end users are
patients without AI or domain expertise, there is an urgent need for model
explanations that are more comprehensible and instil trust in the model's
operations. We hypothesise that generating model explanations that are
narrative, patient-specific and global(holistic of the model) would enable
better understandability and enable decision-making. We test this using a
decision tree model to generate both local and global explanations for patients
identified as having a high risk of coronary heart disease. These explanations
are presented to non-expert users. We find a strong individual preference for a
specific type of explanation. The majority of participants prefer global
explanations, while a smaller group prefers local explanations. A task based
evaluation of mental models of these participants provide valuable feedback to
enhance narrative global explanations. This, in turn, guides the design of
health informatics systems that are both trustworthy and actionable.

##### **An explainable three dimension framework to uncover learning patterns: A unified look in variable sulci recognition**
2309.00903v2 by Michail Mamalakis, Heloise de Vareilles, Atheer AI-Manea, Samantha C. Mitchell, Ingrid Arartz, Lynn Egeland Morch-Johnsen, Jane Garrison, Jon Simons, Pietro Lio, John Suckling, Graham Murray

Explainable AI is crucial in medical imaging. In the challenging field of
neuroscience, visual topics present a high level of complexity, particularly
within three-dimensional space. The application of neuroscience, which involves
identifying brain sulcal features from MRI, faces significant hurdles due to
varying annotation protocols among experts and the intricate three-dimension
functionality of the brain. Consequently, traditional explainability approaches
fall short in effectively validating and evaluating these networks. To address
this, we first present a mathematical formulation delineating various
categories of explanation needs across diverse computer vision tasks,
categorized into self-explanatory, semi-explanatory, non-explanatory, and
new-pattern learning applications based on the reliability of the validation
protocol. With respect to this mathematical formulation, we propose a 3D
explainability framework aimed at validating the outputs of deep learning
networks in detecting the paracingulate sulcus an essential brain anatomical
feature. The framework integrates local 3D explanations, global explanations
through dimensionality reduction, concatenated global explanations, and
statistical shape features, unveiling new insights into pattern learning. We
trained and tested two advanced 3D deep learning networks on the challenging
TOP-OSLO dataset, significantly improving sulcus detection accuracy,
particularly on the left hemisphere. During evaluation with diverse annotation
protocols for this dataset, we highlighted the crucial role of an unbiased
annotation process in achieving precise predictions and effective pattern
learning within our proposed 3D framework. The proposed framework not only
annotates the variable sulcus but also uncovers hidden AI knowledge, promising
to advance our understanding of brain anatomy and function.

##### **Leveraging A Medical Knowledge Graph into Large Language Models for Diagnosis Prediction**
2308.14321v1 by Yanjun Gao, Ruizhe Li, John Caskey, Dmitriy Dligach, Timothy Miller, Matthew M. Churpek, Majid Afshar

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and routine documentation practices play a
vital role in patients' daily care, providing a holistic record of health,
diagnoses, and treatment. However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload
healthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their
application in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of
diagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline
an innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of
automated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical
knowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: Dr.Knows, inspired by the
clinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National
Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust
repository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for
pre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in
the interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using
real-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the
accuracy of automated diagnosis generation. More importantly, our approach
offers an explainable diagnostic pathway, edging us closer to the realization
of AI-augmented diagnostic decision support systems.

##### **Deciphering knee osteoarthritis diagnostic features with explainable artificial intelligence: A systematic review**
2308.09380v1 by Yun Xin Teoh, Alice Othmani, Siew Li Goh, Juliana Usman, Khin Wee Lai

Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnosing knee
osteoarthritis (OA) have faced criticism for their lack of transparency and
interpretability, despite achieving medical-expert-like performance. This
opacity makes them challenging to trust in clinical practice. Recently,
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a specialized
technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by revealing
how the prediction is derived, thus promoting the use of AI systems in
healthcare. This paper presents the first survey of XAI techniques used for
knee OA diagnosis. The XAI techniques are discussed from two perspectives: data
interpretability and model interpretability. The aim of this paper is to
provide valuable insights into XAI's potential towards a more reliable knee OA
diagnosis approach and encourage its adoption in clinical practice.

##### **Explainable AI for clinical risk prediction: a survey of concepts, methods, and modalities**
2308.08407v1 by Munib Mesinovic, Peter Watkinson, Tingting Zhu

Recent advancements in AI applications to healthcare have shown incredible
promise in surpassing human performance in diagnosis and disease prognosis.
With the increasing complexity of AI models, however, concerns regarding their
opacity, potential biases, and the need for interpretability. To ensure trust
and reliability in AI systems, especially in clinical risk prediction models,
explainability becomes crucial. Explainability is usually referred to as an AI
system's ability to provide a robust interpretation of its decision-making
logic or the decisions themselves to human stakeholders. In clinical risk
prediction, other aspects of explainability like fairness, bias, trust, and
transparency also represent important concepts beyond just interpretability. In
this review, we address the relationship between these concepts as they are
often used together or interchangeably. This review also discusses recent
progress in developing explainable models for clinical risk prediction,
highlighting the importance of quantitative and clinical evaluation and
validation across multiple common modalities in clinical practice. It
emphasizes the need for external validation and the combination of diverse
interpretability methods to enhance trust and fairness. Adopting rigorous
testing, such as using synthetic datasets with known generative factors, can
further improve the reliability of explainability methods. Open access and
code-sharing resources are essential for transparency and reproducibility,
enabling the growth and trustworthiness of explainable research. While
challenges exist, an end-to-end approach to explainability in clinical risk
prediction, incorporating stakeholders from clinicians to developers, is
essential for success.

Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for medicine and
healthcare, the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in
real-world clinical practice. In recent years, concerns have been raised about
the technical, clinical, ethical and legal risks associated with medical AI. To
increase real world adoption, it is essential that medical AI tools are trusted
and accepted by patients, clinicians, health organisations and authorities.
This work describes the FUTURE-AI guideline as the first international
consensus framework for guiding the development and deployment of trustworthy
AI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI consortium was founded in 2021 and
currently comprises 118 inter-disciplinary experts from 51 countries
representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinicians, ethicists,
and social scientists. Over a two-year period, the consortium defined guiding
principles and best practices for trustworthy AI through an iterative process
comprising an in-depth literature review, a modified Delphi survey, and online
consensus meetings. The FUTURE-AI framework was established based on 6 guiding
principles for trustworthy AI in healthcare, i.e. Fairness, Universality,
Traceability, Usability, Robustness and Explainability. Through consensus, a
set of 28 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, legal
and socio-ethical dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of
medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment,
and monitoring. FUTURE-AI is a risk-informed, assumption-free guideline which
provides a structured approach for constructing medical AI tools that will be
trusted, deployed and adopted in real-world practice. Researchers are
encouraged to take the recommendations into account in proof-of-concept stages
to facilitate future translation towards clinical practice of medical AI.

##### **Explainable AI applications in the Medical Domain: a systematic review**
2308.05411v1 by Nicoletta Prentzas, Antonis Kakas, Constantinos S. Pattichis

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine has made significant progress with
emerging applications in medical imaging, patient care, and other areas. While
these applications have proven successful in retrospective studies, very few of
them were applied in practice.The field of Medical AI faces various challenges,
in terms of building user trust, complying with regulations, using data
ethically.Explainable AI (XAI) aims to enable humans understand AI and trust
its results. This paper presents a literature review on the recent developments
of XAI solutions for medical decision support, based on a representative sample
of 198 articles published in recent years. The systematic synthesis of the
relevant articles resulted in several findings. (1) model-agnostic XAI
techniques were mostly employed in these solutions, (2) deep learning models
are utilized more than other types of machine learning models, (3)
explainability was applied to promote trust, but very few works reported the
physicians participation in the loop, (4) visual and interactive user interface
is more useful in understanding the explanation and the recommendation of the
system. More research is needed in collaboration between medical and AI
experts, that could guide the development of suitable frameworks for the
design, implementation, and evaluation of XAI solutions in medicine.

##### **Exploring the Role of Explainability in AI-Assisted Embryo Selection**
2308.02534v1 by Lucia Urcelay, Daniel Hinjos, Pablo A. Martin-Torres, Marta Gonzalez, Marta Mendez, Salva Cívico, Sergio Álvarez-Napagao, Dario Garcia-Gasulla

In Vitro Fertilization is among the most widespread treatments for
infertility. One of its main challenges is the evaluation and selection of
embryo for implantation, a process with large inter- and intra-clinician
variability. Deep learning based methods are gaining attention, but their
opaque nature compromises their acceptance in the clinical context, where
transparency in the decision making is key. In this paper we analyze the
current work in the explainability of AI-assisted embryo analysis models,
identifying the limitations. We also discuss how these models could be
integrated in the clinical context as decision support systems, considering the
needs of clinicians and patients. Finally, we propose guidelines for the sake
of increasing interpretability and trustworthiness, pushing this technology
forward towards established clinical practice.

##### **A New Perspective on Evaluation Methods for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**
2307.14246v1 by Timo Speith, Markus Langer

Within the field of Requirements Engineering (RE), the increasing
significance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in aligning
AI-supported systems with user needs, societal expectations, and regulatory
standards has garnered recognition. In general, explainability has emerged as
an important non-functional requirement that impacts system quality. However,
the supposed trade-off between explainability and performance challenges the
presumed positive influence of explainability. If meeting the requirement of
explainability entails a reduction in system performance, then careful
consideration must be given to which of these quality aspects takes precedence
and how to compromise between them. In this paper, we critically examine the
alleged trade-off. We argue that it is best approached in a nuanced way that
incorporates resource availability, domain characteristics, and considerations
of risk. By providing a foundation for future research and best practices, this
work aims to advance the field of RE for AI.

##### **Acceptable risks in Europe's proposed AI Act: Reasonableness and other principles for deciding how much risk management is enough**
2308.02047v1 by Henry Fraser, Jose-Miguel Bello y Villarino

This paper critically evaluates the European Commission's proposed AI Act's
approach to risk management and risk acceptability for high-risk AI systems
that pose risks to fundamental rights and safety. The Act aims to promote
"trustworthy" AI with a proportionate regulatory burden. Its provisions on risk
acceptability require residual risks from high-risk systems to be reduced or
eliminated "as far as possible", having regard to the "state of the art". This
criterion, especially if interpreted narrowly, is unworkable and promotes
neither proportionate regulatory burden, nor trustworthiness. By contrast the
Parliament's most recent draft amendments to the risk management provisions
introduce "reasonableness", cost-benefit analysis, and are more transparent
about the value-laden and contextual nature of risk acceptability judgements.
This paper argues that the Parliament's approach is more workable, and better
balances the goals of proportionality and trustworthiness. It explains what
reasonableness in risk acceptability judgments would entail, drawing on
principles from negligence law and European medical devices regulation. And it
contends that the approach to risk acceptability judgments need a firm
foundation of civic legitimacy: including detailed guidance or involvement from
regulators, and meaningful input from affected stakeholders.

##### **eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in aging clock models**
2307.13704v3 by Alena Kalyakulina, Igor Yusipov, Alexey Moskalev, Claudio Franceschi, Mikhail Ivanchenko

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a rapidly progressing field of
machine learning, aiming to unravel the predictions of complex models. XAI is
especially required in sensitive applications, e.g. in health care, when
diagnosis, recommendations and treatment choices might rely on the decisions
made by artificial intelligence systems. AI approaches have become widely used
in aging research as well, in particular, in developing biological clock models
and identifying biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases. However, the
potential of XAI here awaits to be fully appreciated. We discuss the
application of XAI for developing the "aging clocks" and present a
comprehensive analysis of the literature categorized by the focus on particular
physiological systems.

##### **Interpreting and Correcting Medical Image Classification with PIP-Net**
2307.10404v2 by Meike Nauta, Johannes H. Hegeman, Jeroen Geerdink, Jörg Schlötterer, Maurice van Keulen, Christin Seifert

Part-prototype models are explainable-by-design image classifiers, and a
promising alternative to black box AI. This paper explores the applicability
and potential of interpretable machine learning, in particular PIP-Net, for
automated diagnosis support on real-world medical imaging data. PIP-Net learns
human-understandable prototypical image parts and we evaluate its accuracy and
interpretability for fracture detection and skin cancer diagnosis. We find that
PIP-Net's decision making process is in line with medical classification
standards, while only provided with image-level class labels. Because of
PIP-Net's unsupervised pretraining of prototypes, data quality problems such as
undesired text in an X-ray or labelling errors can be easily identified.
Additionally, we are the first to show that humans can manually correct the
reasoning of PIP-Net by directly disabling undesired prototypes. We conclude
that part-prototype models are promising for medical applications due to their
interpretability and potential for advanced model debugging.

##### **Explaining and visualizing black-box models through counterfactual paths**
2307.07764v3 by Bastian Pfeifer, Mateusz Krzyzinski, Hubert Baniecki, Anna Saranti, Andreas Holzinger, Przemyslaw Biecek

Explainable AI (XAI) is an increasingly important area of machine learning
research, which aims to make black-box models transparent and interpretable. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach to XAI that uses the so-called
counterfactual paths generated by conditional permutations of features. The
algorithm measures feature importance by identifying sequential permutations of
features that most influence changes in model predictions. It is particularly
suitable for generating explanations based on counterfactual paths in knowledge
graphs incorporating domain knowledge. Counterfactual paths introduce an
additional graph dimension to current XAI methods in both explaining and
visualizing black-box models. Experiments with synthetic and medical data
demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach.

##### **Beyond Known Reality: Exploiting Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Research**
2307.02131v5 by Toygar Tanyel, Serkan Ayvaz, Bilgin Keserci

The field of explainability in artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a
growing number of studies and increasing scholarly interest. However, the lack
of human-friendly and individual interpretations in explaining the outcomes of
machine learning algorithms has significantly hindered the acceptance of these
methods by clinicians in their research and clinical practice. To address this
issue, our study uses counterfactual explanations to explore the applicability
of "what if?" scenarios in medical research. Our aim is to expand our
understanding of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features used for diagnosing
pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors beyond existing boundaries. In our case
study, the proposed concept provides a novel way to examine alternative
decision-making scenarios that offer personalized and context-specific
insights, enabling the validation of predictions and clarification of
variations under diverse circumstances. Additionally, we explore the potential
use of counterfactuals for data augmentation and evaluate their feasibility as
an alternative approach in our medical research case. The results demonstrate
the promising potential of using counterfactual explanations to enhance
acceptance of AI-driven methods in clinical research.

##### **AI and Non AI Assessments for Dementia**
2307.01210v1 by Mahboobeh Parsapoor, Hamed Ghodrati, Vincenzo Dentamaro, Christopher R. Madan, Ioulietta Lazarou, Spiros Nikolopoulos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris

Current progress in the artificial intelligence domain has led to the
development of various types of AI-powered dementia assessments, which can be
employed to identify patients at the early stage of dementia. It can
revolutionize the dementia care settings. It is essential that the medical
community be aware of various AI assessments and choose them considering their
degrees of validity, efficiency, practicality, reliability, and accuracy
concerning the early identification of patients with dementia (PwD). On the
other hand, AI developers should be informed about various non-AI assessments
as well as recently developed AI assessments. Thus, this paper, which can be
readable by both clinicians and AI engineers, fills the gap in the literature
in explaining the existing solutions for the recognition of dementia to
clinicians, as well as the techniques used and the most widespread dementia
datasets to AI engineers. It follows a review of papers on AI and non-AI
assessments for dementia to provide valuable information about various dementia
assessments for both the AI and medical communities. The discussion and
conclusion highlight the most prominent research directions and the maturity of
existing solutions.

##### **Active Globally Explainable Learning for Medical Images via Class Association Embedding and Cyclic Adversarial Generation**
2306.07306v1 by Ruitao Xie, Jingbang Chen, Limai Jiang, Rui Xiao, Yi Pan, Yunpeng Cai

Explainability poses a major challenge to artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques. Current studies on explainable AI (XAI) lack the efficiency of
extracting global knowledge about the learning task, thus suffer deficiencies
such as imprecise saliency, context-aware absence and vague meaning. In this
paper, we propose the class association embedding (CAE) approach to address
these issues. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture to embed sample
features and separate them into class-related and individual-related style
vectors simultaneously. Recombining the individual-style code of a given sample
with the class-style code of another leads to a synthetic sample with preserved
individual characters but changed class assignment, following a cyclic
adversarial learning strategy. Class association embedding distills the global
class-related features of all instances into a unified domain with well
separation between classes. The transition rules between different classes can
be then extracted and further employed to individual instances. We then propose
an active XAI framework which manipulates the class-style vector of a certain
sample along guided paths towards the counter-classes, resulting in a series of
counter-example synthetic samples with identical individual characters.
Comparing these counterfactual samples with the original ones provides a
global, intuitive illustration to the nature of the classification tasks. We
adopt the framework on medical image classification tasks, which show that more
precise saliency maps with powerful context-aware representation can be
achieved compared with existing methods. Moreover, the disease pathology can be
directly visualized via traversing the paths in the class-style space.

Providing high quality explanations for AI predictions based on machine
learning is a challenging and complex task. To work well it requires, among
other factors: selecting a proper level of generality/specificity of the
explanation; considering assumptions about the familiarity of the explanation
beneficiary with the AI task under consideration; referring to specific
elements that have contributed to the decision; making use of additional
knowledge (e.g. expert evidence) which might not be part of the prediction
process; and providing evidence supporting negative hypothesis. Finally, the
system needs to formulate the explanation in a clearly interpretable, and
possibly convincing, way. Given these considerations, ANTIDOTE fosters an
integrated vision of explainable AI, where low-level characteristics of the
deep learning process are combined with higher level schemes proper of the
human argumentation capacity. ANTIDOTE will exploit cross-disciplinary
competences in deep learning and argumentation to support a broader and
innovative view of explainable AI, where the need for high-quality explanations
for clinical cases deliberation is critical. As a first result of the project,
we publish the Antidote CasiMedicos dataset to facilitate research on
explainable AI in general, and argumentation in the medical domain in
particular.

##### **XInsight: Revealing Model Insights for GNNs with Flow-based Explanations**
2306.04791v1 by Eli Laird, Ayesh Madushanka, Elfi Kraka, Corey Clark

Progress in graph neural networks has grown rapidly in recent years, with
many new developments in drug discovery, medical diagnosis, and recommender
systems. While this progress is significant, many networks are `black boxes'
with little understanding of the `what' exactly the network is learning. Many
high-stakes applications, such as drug discovery, require human-intelligible
explanations from the models so that users can recognize errors and discover
new knowledge. Therefore, the development of explainable AI algorithms is
essential for us to reap the benefits of AI.
  We propose an explainability algorithm for GNNs called eXplainable Insight
(XInsight) that generates a distribution of model explanations using GFlowNets.
Since GFlowNets generate objects with probabilities proportional to a reward,
XInsight can generate a diverse set of explanations, compared to previous
methods that only learn the maximum reward sample. We demonstrate XInsight by
generating explanations for GNNs trained on two graph classification tasks:
classifying mutagenic compounds with the MUTAG dataset and classifying acyclic
graphs with a synthetic dataset that we have open-sourced. We show the utility
of XInsight's explanations by analyzing the generated compounds using QSAR
modeling, and we find that XInsight generates compounds that cluster by
lipophilicity, a known correlate of mutagenicity. Our results show that
XInsight generates a distribution of explanations that uncovers the underlying
relationships demonstrated by the model. They also highlight the importance of
generating a diverse set of explanations, as it enables us to discover hidden
relationships in the model and provides valuable guidance for further analysis.

##### **Explainable AI using expressive Boolean formulas**
2306.03976v1 by Gili Rosenberg, J. Kyle Brubaker, Martin J. A. Schuetz, Grant Salton, Zhihuai Zhu, Elton Yechao Zhu, Serdar Kadıoğlu, Sima E. Borujeni, Helmut G. Katzgraber

We propose and implement an interpretable machine learning classification
model for Explainable AI (XAI) based on expressive Boolean formulas. Potential
applications include credit scoring and diagnosis of medical conditions. The
Boolean formula defines a rule with tunable complexity (or interpretability),
according to which input data are classified. Such a formula can include any
operator that can be applied to one or more Boolean variables, thus providing
higher expressivity compared to more rigid rule-based and tree-based
approaches. The classifier is trained using native local optimization
techniques, efficiently searching the space of feasible formulas. Shallow rules
can be determined by fast Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers, potentially powered by
special purpose hardware or quantum devices. We combine the expressivity and
efficiency of the native local optimizer with the fast operation of these
devices by executing non-local moves that optimize over subtrees of the full
Boolean formula. We provide extensive numerical benchmarking results featuring
several baselines on well-known public datasets. Based on the results, we find
that the native local rule classifier is generally competitive with the other
classifiers. The addition of non-local moves achieves similar results with
fewer iterations, and therefore using specialized or quantum hardware could
lead to a speedup by fast proposal of non-local moves.

##### **Utterance Classification with Logical Neural Network: Explainable AI for Mental Disorder Diagnosis**
2306.03902v1 by Yeldar Toleubay, Don Joven Agravante, Daiki Kimura, Baihan Lin, Djallel Bouneffouf, Michiaki Tatsubori

In response to the global challenge of mental health problems, we proposes a
Logical Neural Network (LNN) based Neuro-Symbolic AI method for the diagnosis
of mental disorders. Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental
disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with
the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and
may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network
architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with
the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system
uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder
class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve
scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction
method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses
the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more
trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.

##### **A Novel real-time arrhythmia detection model using YOLOv8**
2305.16727v3 by Guang Jun Nicholas Ang, Aritejh Kr Goil, Henryk Chan, Jieyi Jeric Lew, Xin Chun Lee, Raihan Bin Ahmad Mustaffa, Timotius Jason, Ze Ting Woon, Bingquan Shen

In a landscape characterized by heightened connectivity and mobility, coupled
with a surge in cardiovascular ailments, the imperative to curtail healthcare
expenses through remote monitoring of cardiovascular health has become more
pronounced. The accurate detection and classification of cardiac arrhythmias
are pivotal for diagnosing individuals with heart irregularities. This study
underscores the feasibility of employing electrocardiograms (ECG) measurements
in the home environment for real-time arrhythmia detection. Presenting a fresh
application for arrhythmia detection, this paper leverages the cutting-edge
You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v8 algorithm to categorize single-lead ECG signals. We
introduce a novel loss-modified YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned on the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia dataset, enabling real-time continuous monitoring. The obtained
results substantiate the efficacy of our approach, with the model attaining an
average accuracy of 99.5% and 0.992 mAP@50, and a rapid detection time of 0.002
seconds on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. Our investigation exemplifies the potential of
real-time arrhythmia detection, enabling users to visually interpret the model
output within the comfort of their homes. Furthermore, this study lays the
groundwork for an extension into a real-time explainable AI (XAI) model capable
of deployment in the healthcare sector, thereby significantly advancing the
realm of healthcare solutions.

##### **Breast Cancer Segmentation using Attention-based Convolutional Network and Explainable AI**
2305.14389v2 by Jai Vardhan, Taraka Satya Krishna Teja Malisetti

Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant health threat, with no long-term
cure currently available. Early detection is crucial, yet mammography
interpretation is hindered by high false positives and negatives. With BC
incidence projected to surpass lung cancer, improving early detection methods
is vital. Thermography, using high-resolution infrared cameras, offers promise,
especially when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). This work presents
an attention-based convolutional neural network for segmentation, providing
increased speed and precision in BC detection and classification. The system
enhances images and performs cancer segmentation with explainable AI. We
propose a transformer-attention-based convolutional architecture (UNet) for
fault identification and employ Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM) to analyze areas of bias and weakness in the UNet architecture with
IRT images. The superiority of our proposed framework is confirmed when
compared with existing deep learning frameworks.

##### **What Symptoms and How Long? An Interpretable AI Approach for Depression Detection in Social Media**
2305.13127v2 by Junwei Kuang, Jiaheng Xie, Zhijun Yan

Depression is the most prevalent and serious mental illness, which induces
grave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for
early intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision
inherently necessitates interpretability. Although a few depression detection
studies attempt to explain the decision based on the importance score or
attention weights, these explanations misalign with the clinical depression
diagnosis criterion that is based on depressive symptoms. To fill this gap, we
follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel Multi-Scale
Temporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet innovatively detects and
interprets depressive symptoms as well as how long they last. Extensive
empirical analyses using a large-scale dataset show that MSTPNet outperforms
state-of-the-art depression detection methods with an F1-score of 0.851. This
result also reveals new symptoms that are unnoted in the survey approach, such
as sharing admiration for a different life. We further conduct a user study to
demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study
contributes to IS literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for
depression detection in social media. In practice, our proposed method can be
implemented in social media platforms to provide personalized online resources
for detected depressed patients.

##### **Echoes of Biases: How Stigmatizing Language Affects AI Performance**
2305.10201v4 by Yizhi Liu, Weiguang Wang, Guodong Gordon Gao, Ritu Agarwal

Electronic health records (EHRs) serve as an essential data source for the
envisioned artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation in healthcare.
However, clinician biases reflected in EHR notes can lead to AI models
inheriting and amplifying these biases, perpetuating health disparities. This
study investigates the impact of stigmatizing language (SL) in EHR notes on
mortality prediction using a Transformer-based deep learning model and
explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our findings demonstrate that SL written by
clinicians adversely affects AI performance, particularly so for black
patients, highlighting SL as a source of racial disparity in AI model
development. To explore an operationally efficient way to mitigate SL's impact,
we investigate patterns in the generation of SL through a clinicians'
collaborative network, identifying central clinicians as having a stronger
impact on racial disparity in the AI model. We find that removing SL written by
central clinicians is a more efficient bias reduction strategy than eliminating
all SL in the entire corpus of data. This study provides actionable insights
for responsible AI development and contributes to understanding clinician
behavior and EHR note writing in healthcare.

##### **Explaining the ghosts: Feminist intersectional XAI and cartography as methods to account for invisible labour**
2305.03376v1 by Goda Klumbyte, Hannah Piehl, Claude Draude

Contemporary automation through AI entails a substantial amount of
behind-the-scenes human labour, which is often both invisibilised and
underpaid. Since invisible labour, including labelling and maintenance work, is
an integral part of contemporary AI systems, it remains important to sensitise
users to its role. We suggest that this could be done through explainable AI
(XAI) design, particularly feminist intersectional XAI. We propose the method
of cartography, which stems from feminist intersectional research, to draw out
a systemic perspective of AI and include dimensions of AI that pertain to
invisible labour.

##### **Towards Explainable and Safe Conversational Agents for Mental Health: A Survey**
2304.13191v1 by Surjodeep Sarkar, Manas Gaur, L. Chen, Muskan Garg, Biplav Srivastava, Bhaktee Dongaonkar

Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) are seeing continual advancements to
support the overburdened global healthcare system that gets 60 million primary
care visits, and 6 million Emergency Room (ER) visits annually. These systems
are built by clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) researchers for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). At present, the role
of VMHAs is to provide emotional support through information, focusing less on
developing a reflective conversation with the patient. A more comprehensive,
safe and explainable approach is required to build responsible VMHAs to ask
follow-up questions or provide a well-informed response. This survey offers a
systematic critical review of the existing conversational agents in mental
health, followed by new insights into the improvements of VMHAs with contextual
knowledge, datasets, and their emerging role in clinical decision support. We
also provide new directions toward enriching the user experience of VMHAs with
explainability, safety, and wholesome trustworthiness. Finally, we provide
evaluation metrics and practical considerations for VMHAs beyond the current
literature to build trust between VMHAs and patients in active communications.

XAI refers to the techniques and methods for building AI applications which
assist end users to interpret output and predictions of AI models. Black box AI
applications in high-stakes decision-making situations, such as medical domain
have increased the demand for transparency and explainability since wrong
predictions may have severe consequences. Model explainability and
interpretability are vital successful deployment of AI models in healthcare
practices. AI applications' underlying reasoning needs to be transparent to
clinicians in order to gain their trust. This paper presents a systematic
review of XAI aspects and challenges in the healthcare domain. The primary
goals of this study are to review various XAI methods, their challenges, and
related machine learning models in healthcare. The methods are discussed under
six categories: Features-oriented methods, global methods, concept models,
surrogate models, local pixel-based methods, and human-centric methods. Most
importantly, the paper explores XAI role in healthcare problems to clarify its
necessity in safety-critical applications. The paper intends to establish a
comprehensive understanding of XAI-related applications in the healthcare field
by reviewing the related experimental results. To facilitate future research
for filling research gaps, the importance of XAI models from different
viewpoints and their limitations are investigated.

2303.12641v2 by Frederik Pahde, Maximilian Dreyer, Wojciech Samek, Sebastian Lapuschkin

State-of-the-art machine learning models often learn spurious correlations
embedded in the training data. This poses risks when deploying these models for
high-stake decision-making, such as in medical applications like skin cancer
detection. To tackle this problem, we propose Reveal to Revise (R2R), a
framework entailing the entire eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) life
cycle, enabling practitioners to iteratively identify, mitigate, and
(re-)evaluate spurious model behavior with a minimal amount of human
interaction. In the first step (1), R2R reveals model weaknesses by finding
outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by
the model. Secondly (2), the responsible artifacts are detected and spatially
localized in the input data, which is then leveraged to (3) revise the model
behavior. Concretely, we apply the methods of RRR, CDEP and ClArC for model
correction, and (4) (re-)evaluate the model's performance and remaining
sensitivity towards the artifact. Using two medical benchmark datasets for
Melanoma detection and bone age estimation, we apply our R2R framework to VGG,
ResNet and EfficientNet architectures and thereby reveal and correct real
dataset-intrinsic artifacts, as well as synthetic variants in a controlled
setting. Completing the XAI life cycle, we demonstrate multiple R2R iterations
to mitigate different biases. Code is available on

##### **Explainable AI for Time Series via Virtual Inspection Layers**
2303.06365v1 by Johanna Vielhaben, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Grégoire Montavon, Wojciech Samek

The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has greatly advanced
in recent years, but progress has mainly been made in computer vision and
natural language processing. For time series, where the input is often not
interpretable, only limited research on XAI is available. In this work, we put
forward a virtual inspection layer, that transforms the time series to an
interpretable representation and allows to propagate relevance attributions to
this representation via local XAI methods like layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP). In this way, we extend the applicability of a family of XAI methods to
domains (e.g. speech) where the input is only interpretable after a
transformation. Here, we focus on the Fourier transformation which is
prominently applied in the interpretation of time series and LRP and refer to
our method as DFT-LRP. We demonstrate the usefulness of DFT-LRP in various time
series classification settings like audio and electronic health records. We
showcase how DFT-LRP reveals differences in the classification strategies of
models trained in different domains (e.g., time vs. frequency domain) or helps
to discover how models act on spurious correlations in the data.

##### **Towards Trust of Explainable AI in Thyroid Nodule Diagnosis**
2303.04731v1 by Truong Thanh Hung Nguyen, Van Binh Truong, Vo Thanh Khang Nguyen, Quoc Hung Cao, Quoc Khanh Nguyen

The ability to explain the prediction of deep learning models to end-users is
an important feature to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for
the medical decision-making process, which is usually considered
non-transparent and challenging to comprehend. In this paper, we apply
state-of-the-art eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to explain
the prediction of the black-box AI models in the thyroid nodule diagnosis
application. We propose new statistic-based XAI methods, namely Kernel Density
Estimation and Density map, to explain the case of no nodule detected. XAI
methods' performances are considered under a qualitative and quantitative
comparison as feedback to improve the data quality and the model performance.
Finally, we survey to assess doctors' and patients' trust in XAI explanations
of the model's decisions on thyroid nodule images.

##### **Cybersecurity of AI medical devices: risks, legislation, and challenges**
2303.03140v1 by Elisabetta Biasin, Erik Kamenjasevic, Kaspar Rosager Ludvigsen

Medical devices and artificial intelligence systems rapidly transform
healthcare provisions. At the same time, due to their nature, AI in or as
medical devices might get exposed to cyberattacks, leading to patient safety
and security risks. This book chapter is divided into three parts. The first
part starts by setting the scene where we explain the role of cybersecurity in
healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI that
is considered a medical device by itself or supports one. To illustrate the
risks such medical devices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of
datasets, social engineering, and data or source code extraction. In the second
part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union's regulatory
framework relevant for ensuring the cybersecurity of AI as or in medical
devices (MDR, NIS Directive, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, the AI Act proposal and
the NIS 2 Directive proposal). Finally, the third part of the paper examines
possible challenges stemming from the EU regulatory framework. In particular,
we look toward the challenges deriving from the two legislative proposals and
their interaction with the existing legislation concerning AI medical devices'
cybersecurity. They are structured as answers to the following questions: (1)
how will the AI Act interact with the MDR regarding the cybersecurity and
safety requirements?; (2) how should we interpret incident notification
requirements from the NIS 2 Directive proposal and MDR?; and (3) what are the
consequences of the evolving term of critical infrastructures?

##### **LAVA: Granular Neuron-Level Explainable AI for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment from Fundus Images**
2302.03008v2 by Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Charlie Tran, Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora, Jinghua Chen, Ruogu Fang, My T. Thai

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the
leading cause of dementia. Early diagnosis is critical for patients to benefit
from potential intervention and treatment. The retina has been hypothesized as
a diagnostic site for AD detection owing to its anatomical connection with the
brain. Developed AI models for this purpose have yet to provide a rational
explanation about the decision and neither infer the stage of disease's
progression. Along this direction, we propose a novel model-agnostic
explainable-AI framework, called Granular Neuron-level Explainer (LAVA), an
interpretation prototype that probes into intermediate layers of the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to assess the AD continuum directly
from the retinal imaging without longitudinal or clinical evaluation. This
method is applied to validate the retinal vasculature as a biomarker and
diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) evaluation. UK Biobank
cognitive tests and vascular morphological features suggest LAVA shows strong
promise and effectiveness in identifying AD stages across the progression
continuum.

##### **Diagrammatization: Rationalizing with diagrammatic AI explanations for abductive-deductive reasoning on hypotheses**
2302.01241v2 by Brian Y. Lim, Joseph P. Cahaly, Chester Y. F. Sng, Adam Chew

Many visualizations have been developed for explainable AI (XAI), but they
often require further reasoning by users to interpret. We argue that XAI should
support diagrammatic and abductive reasoning for the AI to perform hypothesis
generation and evaluation to reduce the interpretability gap. We propose
Diagrammatization to i) perform Peircean abductive-deductive reasoning, ii)
follow domain conventions, and iii) explain with diagrams visually or verbally.
We implemented DiagramNet for a clinical application to predict cardiac
diagnoses from heart auscultation, and explain with shape-based murmur
diagrams. In modeling studies, we found that DiagramNet not only provides
faithful murmur shape explanations, but also has better prediction performance
than baseline models. We further demonstrate the interpretability and
trustworthiness of diagrammatic explanations in a qualitative user study with
medical students, showing that clinically-relevant, diagrammatic explanations
are preferred over technical saliency map explanations. This work contributes
insights into providing domain-conventional abductive explanations for
user-centric XAI.

##### **LesionAid: Vision Transformers-based Skin Lesion Generation and Classification**
2302.01104v1 by Ghanta Sai Krishna, Kundrapu Supriya, Mallikharjuna Rao K, Meetiksha Sorgile

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of human cancer. It is
recognized mainly visually, beginning with clinical screening and continuing
with the dermoscopic examination, histological assessment, and specimen
collection. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform highly segregated
and potentially universal tasks against a classified finegrained object. This
research proposes a novel multi-class prediction framework that classifies skin
lesions based on ViT and ViTGAN. Vision transformers-based GANs (Generative
Adversarial Networks) are utilized to tackle the class imbalance. The framework
consists of four main phases: ViTGANs, Image processing, and explainable AI.
Phase 1 consists of generating synthetic images to balance all the classes in
the dataset. Phase 2 consists of applying different data augmentation
techniques and morphological operations to increase the size of the data.
Phases 3 & 4 involve developing a ViT model for edge computing systems that can
identify patterns and categorize skin lesions from the user's skin visible in
the image. In phase 3, after classifying the lesions into the desired class
with ViT, we will use explainable AI (XAI) that leads to more explainable
results (using activation maps, etc.) while ensuring high predictive accuracy.
Real-time images of skin diseases can capture by a doctor or a patient using
the camera of a mobile application to perform an early examination and
determine the cause of the skin lesion. The whole framework is compared with
the existing frameworks for skin lesion detection.

##### **SkinCon: A skin disease dataset densely annotated by domain experts for fine-grained model debugging and analysis**
2302.00785v1 by Roxana Daneshjou, Mert Yuksekgonul, Zhuo Ran Cai, Roberto Novoa, James Zou

For the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in high-risk settings,
such as healthcare, methods that provide interpretability/explainability or
allow fine-grained error analysis are critical. Many recent methods for
interpretability/explainability and fine-grained error analysis use concepts,
which are meta-labels that are semantically meaningful to humans. However,
there are only a few datasets that include concept-level meta-labels and most
of these meta-labels are relevant for natural images that do not require domain
expertise. Densely annotated datasets in medicine focused on meta-labels that
are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease
is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to
describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset
densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple
disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely
annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick
17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at
least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two
dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin
lesions. Examples include "plaque", "scale", and "erosion". The same concepts
were also used to label 656 skin disease images from the Diverse Dermatology
Images dataset, providing an additional external dataset with diverse skin tone
representations. We review the potential applications for the SkinCon dataset,
such as probing models, concept-based explanations, and concept bottlenecks.
Furthermore, we use SkinCon to demonstrate two of these use cases: debugging
mistakes of an existing dermatology AI model with concepts and developing
interpretable models with post-hoc concept bottleneck models.

##### **Decision-Focused Evaluation: Analyzing Performance of Deployed Restless Multi-Arm Bandits**
2301.07835v1 by Paritosh Verma, Shresth Verma, Aditya Mate, Aparna Taneja, Milind Tambe

Restless multi-arm bandits (RMABs) is a popular decision-theoretic framework
that has been used to model real-world sequential decision making problems in
public health, wildlife conservation, communication systems, and beyond.
Deployed RMAB systems typically operate in two stages: the first predicts the
unknown parameters defining the RMAB instance, and the second employs an
optimization algorithm to solve the constructed RMAB instance.
  In this work we provide and analyze the results from a first-of-its-kind
deployment of an RMAB system in public health domain, aimed at improving
maternal and child health. Our analysis is focused towards understanding the
relationship between prediction accuracy and overall performance of deployed
RMAB systems. This is crucial for determining the value of investing in
improving predictive accuracy towards improving the final system performance,
and is useful for diagnosing, monitoring deployed RMAB systems.
  Using real-world data from our deployed RMAB system, we demonstrate that an
improvement in overall prediction accuracy may even be accompanied by a
degradation in the performance of RMAB system -- a broad investment of
resources to improve overall prediction accuracy may not yield expected
results. Following this, we develop decision-focused evaluation metrics to
evaluate the predictive component and show that it is better at explaining
(both empirically and theoretically) the overall performance of a deployed RMAB
system.

##### **Exemplars and Counterexemplars Explanations for Image Classifiers, Targeting Skin Lesion Labeling**
2302.03033v1 by Carlo Metta, Riccardo Guidotti, Yuan Yin, Patrick Gallinari, Salvatore Rinzivillo

Explainable AI consists in developing mechanisms allowing for an interaction
between decision systems and humans by making the decisions of the formers
understandable. This is particularly important in sensitive contexts like in
the medical domain. We propose a use case study, for skin lesion diagnosis,
illustrating how it is possible to provide the practitioner with explanations
on the decisions of a state of the art deep neural network classifier trained
to characterize skin lesions from examples. Our framework consists of a trained
classifier onto which an explanation module operates. The latter is able to
offer the practitioner exemplars and counterexemplars for the classification
diagnosis thus allowing the physician to interact with the automatic diagnosis
system. The exemplars are generated via an adversarial autoencoder. We
illustrate the behavior of the system on representative examples.

##### **Monotonicity for AI ethics and society: An empirical study of the monotonic neural additive model in criminology, education, health care, and finance**
2301.07060v1 by Dangxing Chen, Luyao Zhang

Algorithm fairness in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is
essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,
fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)
community has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity,
especially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses
another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a
vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide
human decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first
systematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive
models (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both
individual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics
and society. We have found, through a hybrid method of theoretical reasoning,
simulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity
axioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,
health care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary
research at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and
human-computer interactions (HCIs). By evidencing the catastrophic consequences
if monotonicity is not met, we address the significance of monotonicity
requirements in AI applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MNAMs are an
effective fairness-aware ML approach by imposing monotonicity restrictions
integrating human intelligence.

##### **Rationalizing Predictions by Adversarial Information Calibration**
2301.06009v1 by Lei Sha, Oana-Maria Camburu, Thomas Lukasiewicz

Explaining the predictions of AI models is paramount in safety-critical
applications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for
a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an
instance that lead the model to give its prediction on that instance. For
example, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive
rationale for the prediction of ``Theft''. Previous works on generating
extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects
the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that
makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One
disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select
features comes from the comparison of the answers given by the predictor to the
ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from
the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train
two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand
in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor
model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first
model is used as a guide for the second model. We use an adversarial technique
to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the
difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected
features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose a
language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent
rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task, a hate speech
recognition task as well as on three tasks from the legal domain show the
effectiveness of our approach to rationale extraction.

##### **Semantic match: Debugging feature attribution methods in XAI for healthcare**
2301.02080v3 by Giovanni Cinà, Tabea E. Röber, Rob Goedhart, Ş. İlker Birbil

The recent spike in certified Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for
healthcare has renewed the debate around adoption of this technology. One
thread of such debate concerns Explainable AI (XAI) and its promise to render
AI devices more transparent and trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical
AI space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI
techniques and especially feature attribution methods, questioning their use
and inclusion in guidelines and standards. Despite valid concerns, we argue
that existing criticism on the viability of post-hoc local explainability
methods throws away the baby with the bathwater by generalizing a problem that
is specific to image data. We begin by characterizing the problem as a lack of
semantic match between explanations and human understanding. To understand when
feature importance can be used reliably, we introduce a distinction between
feature importance of low- and high-level features. We argue that for data
types where low-level features come endowed with a clear semantics, such as
tabular data like Electronic Health Records (EHRs), semantic match can be
obtained, and thus feature attribution methods can still be employed in a
meaningful and useful way. Finally, we sketch a procedure to test whether
semantic match has been achieved.

##### **Context-dependent Explainability and Contestability for Trustworthy Medical Artificial Intelligence: Misclassification Identification of Morbidity Recognition Models in Preterm Infants**
2212.08821v1 by Isil Guzey, Ozlem Ucar, Nukhet Aladag Ciftdemir, Betul Acunas

Although machine learning (ML) models of AI achieve high performances in
medicine, they are not free of errors. Empowering clinicians to identify
incorrect model recommendations is crucial for engendering trust in medical AI.
Explainable AI (XAI) aims to address this requirement by clarifying AI
reasoning to support the end users. Several studies on biomedical imaging
achieved promising results recently. Nevertheless, solutions for models using
tabular data are not sufficient to meet the requirements of clinicians yet.
This paper proposes a methodology to support clinicians in identifying failures
of ML models trained with tabular data. We built our methodology on three main
pillars: decomposing the feature set by leveraging clinical context latent
space, assessing the clinical association of global explanations, and Latent
Space Similarity (LSS) based local explanations. We demonstrated our
methodology on ML-based recognition of preterm infant morbidities caused by
infection. The risk of mortality, lifelong disability, and antibiotic
resistance due to model failures was an open research question in this domain.
We achieved to identify misclassification cases of two models with our
approach. By contextualizing local explanations, our solution provides
clinicians with actionable insights to support their autonomy for informed
final decisions.

##### **It is not "accuracy vs. explainability" -- we need both for trustworthy AI systems**
2212.11136v2 by D. Petkovic

We are witnessing the emergence of an AI economy and society where AI
technologies are increasingly impacting health care, business, transportation
and many aspects of everyday life. Many successes have been reported where AI
systems even surpassed the accuracy of human experts. However, AI systems may
produce errors, can exhibit bias, may be sensitive to noise in the data, and
often lack technical and judicial transparency resulting in reduction in trust
and challenges in their adoption. These recent shortcomings and concerns have
been documented in scientific but also in general press such as accidents with
self driving cars, biases in healthcare, hiring and face recognition systems
for people of color, seemingly correct medical decisions later found to be made
due to wrong reasons etc. This resulted in emergence of many government and
regulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy
and robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight,
elimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in
delivery of trustworthy AI systems motivated intense research on explainable AI
systems (XAI). Aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how
AI systems make their decisions. In this paper we first briefly summarize
current XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments of accuracy vs.
explainability for being mutually exclusive and being focused only on deep
learning. We then present our recommendations for the use of XAI in full
lifecycle of high stakes trustworthy AI systems delivery, e.g. development,
validation and certification, and trustworthy production and maintenance.

##### **SimpleMind adds thinking to deep neural networks**
2212.00951v1 by Youngwon Choi, M. Wasil Wahi-Anwar, Matthew S. Brown

Deep neural networks (DNNs) detect patterns in data and have shown
versatility and strong performance in many computer vision applications.
However, DNNs alone are susceptible to obvious mistakes that violate simple,
common sense concepts and are limited in their ability to use explicit
knowledge to guide their search and decision making. While overall DNN
performance metrics may be good, these obvious errors, coupled with a lack of
explainability, have prevented widespread adoption for crucial tasks such as
medical image analysis. The purpose of this paper is to introduce SimpleMind,
an open-source software framework for Cognitive AI focused on medical image
understanding. It allows creation of a knowledge base that describes expected
characteristics and relationships between image objects in an intuitive
human-readable form. The SimpleMind framework brings thinking to DNNs by: (1)
providing methods for reasoning with the knowledge base about image content,
such as spatial inferencing and conditional reasoning to check DNN outputs; (2)
applying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents,
that are chained together to accomplish image preprocessing, DNN prediction,
and result post-processing, and (3) performing automatic co-optimization of all
knowledge base parameters to adapt agents to specific problems. SimpleMind
enables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing
cross checking between DNN outputs. This machine reasoning improves the
reliability and trustworthiness of DNNs through an interpretable model and
explainable decisions. Example applications are provided that demonstrate how
SimpleMind supports and improves deep neural networks by embedding them within
a Cognitive AI framework.

##### **Attribution-based XAI Methods in Computer Vision: A Review**
2211.14736v1 by Kumar Abhishek, Deeksha Kamath

The advancements in deep learning-based methods for visual perception tasks
have seen astounding growth in the last decade, with widespread adoption in a
plethora of application areas from autonomous driving to clinical decision
support systems. Despite their impressive performance, these deep
learning-based models remain fairly opaque in their decision-making process,
making their deployment in human-critical tasks a risky endeavor. This in turn
makes understanding the decisions made by these models crucial for their
reliable deployment. Explainable AI (XAI) methods attempt to address this by
offering explanations for such black-box deep learning methods. In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive survey of attribution-based XAI methods in computer
vision and review the existing literature for gradient-based,
perturbation-based, and contrastive methods for XAI, and provide insights on
the key challenges in developing and evaluating robust XAI methods.

##### **Privacy Meets Explainability: A Comprehensive Impact Benchmark**
2211.04110v1 by Saifullah Saifullah, Dominique Mercier, Adriano Lucieri, Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed

Since the mid-10s, the era of Deep Learning (DL) has continued to this day,
bringing forth new superlatives and innovations each year. Nevertheless, the
speed with which these innovations translate into real applications lags behind
this fast pace. Safety-critical applications, in particular, underlie strict
regulatory and ethical requirements which need to be taken care of and are
still active areas of debate. eXplainable AI (XAI) and privacy-preserving
machine learning (PPML) are both crucial research fields, aiming at mitigating
some of the drawbacks of prevailing data-hungry black-box models in DL. Despite
brisk research activity in the respective fields, no attention has yet been
paid to their interaction. This work is the first to investigate the impact of
private learning techniques on generated explanations for DL-based models. In
an extensive experimental analysis covering various image and time series
datasets from multiple domains, as well as varying privacy techniques, XAI
methods, and model architectures, the effects of private training on generated
explanations are studied. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in
explanations through the introduction of privacy. Apart from reporting
individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for
the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the
interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this work is a first step
towards overcoming the remaining hurdles for practically applicable AI in
safety-critical domains.

##### **Predicting Treatment Adherence of Tuberculosis Patients at Scale**
2211.02943v2 by Mihir Kulkarni, Satvik Golechha, Rishi Raj, Jithin Sreedharan, Ankit Bhardwaj, Santanu Rathod, Bhavin Vadera, Jayakrishna Kurada, Sanjay Mattoo, Rajendra Joshi, Kirankumar Rade, Alpan Raval

Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause of
death, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new
cases reported globally in $2020$. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the
medication regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus,
proactively identifying patients at risk of dropping off their medication
regimen enables corrective measures to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy
measure of extreme non-adherence and a dataset of nearly $700,000$ patients
from four states in India, we formulate and solve the machine learning (ML)
problem of early prediction of non-adherence based on a custom rank-based
metric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines, achieving a $\sim
100\%$ lift over rule-based baselines and $\sim 214\%$ over a random
classifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We
deal with various issues in the process, including data quality,
high-cardinality categorical data, low target prevalence, distribution shift,
variation across cohorts, algorithmic fairness, and the need for robustness and
explainability. Our findings indicate that risk stratification of non-adherent
patients is a viable, deployable-at-scale ML solution. As the official AI
partner of India's Central TB Division, we are working on multiple city and
state-level pilots with the goal of pan-India deployment.

##### **Explainable AI over the Internet of Things (IoT): Overview, State-of-the-Art and Future Directions**
2211.01036v2 by Senthil Kumar Jagatheesaperumal, Quoc-Viet Pham, Rukhsana Ruby, Zhaohui Yang, Chunmei Xu, Zhaoyang Zhang

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is transforming the field of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enhancing the trust of end-users in machines.
As the number of connected devices keeps on growing, the Internet of Things
(IoT) market needs to be trustworthy for the end-users. However, existing
literature still lacks a systematic and comprehensive survey work on the use of
XAI for IoT. To bridge this lacking, in this paper, we address the XAI
frameworks with a focus on their characteristics and support for IoT. We
illustrate the widely-used XAI services for IoT applications, such as security
enhancement, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and
Internet of City Things (IoCT). We also suggest the implementation choice of
XAI models over IoT systems in these applications with appropriate examples and
summarize the key inferences for future works. Moreover, we present the
cutting-edge development in edge XAI structures and the support of
sixth-generation (6G) communication services for IoT applications, along with
key inferences. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic
compilation on the development of XAI-based frameworks tailored for the demands
of future IoT use cases.

##### **Human-centered XAI for Burn Depth Characterization**
2210.13535v2 by Maxwell J. Jacobson, Daniela Chanci Arrubla, Maria Romeo Tricas, Gayle Gordillo, Yexiang Xue, Chandan Sen, Juan Wachs

Approximately 1.25 million people in the United States are treated each year
for burn injuries. Precise burn injury classification is an important aspect of
the medical AI field. In this work, we propose an explainable human-in-the-loop
framework for improving burn ultrasound classification models. Our framework
leverages an explanation system based on the LIME classification explainer to
corroborate and integrate a burn expert's knowledge -- suggesting new features
and ensuring the validity of the model. Using this framework, we discover that
B-mode ultrasound classifiers can be enhanced by supplying textural features.
More specifically, we confirm that texture features based on the Gray Level
Co-occurance Matrix (GLCM) of ultrasound frames can increase the accuracy of
transfer learned burn depth classifiers. We test our hypothesis on real data
from porcine subjects. We show improvements in the accuracy of burn depth
classification -- from ~88% to ~94% -- once modified according to our
framework.

##### **What Do End-Users Really Want? Investigation of Human-Centered XAI for Mobile Health Apps**
2210.03506v1 by Katharina Weitz, Alexander Zellner, Elisabeth André

In healthcare, AI systems support clinicians and patients in diagnosis,
treatment, and monitoring, but many systems' poor explainability remains
challenging for practical application. Overcoming this barrier is the goal of
explainable AI (XAI). However, an explanation can be perceived differently and,
thus, not solve the black-box problem for everyone. The domain of
Human-Centered AI deals with this problem by adapting AI to users. We present a
user-centered persona concept to evaluate XAI and use it to investigate
end-users preferences for various explanation styles and contents in a mobile
health stress monitoring application. The results of our online survey show
that users' demographics and personality, as well as the type of explanation,
impact explanation preferences, indicating that these are essential features
for XAI design. We subsumed the results in three prototypical user personas:
power-, casual-, and privacy-oriented users. Our insights bring an interactive,
human-centered XAI closer to practical application.

##### **Explainable AI based Glaucoma Detection using Transfer Learning and LIME**
2210.03332v1 by Touhidul Islam Chayan, Anita Islam, Eftykhar Rahman, Md. Tanzim Reza, Tasnim Sakib Apon, MD. Golam Rabiul Alam

Glaucoma is the second driving reason for partial or complete blindness among
all the visual deficiencies which mainly occurs because of excessive pressure
in the eye due to anxiety or depression which damages the optic nerve and
creates complications in vision. Traditional glaucoma screening is a
time-consuming process that necessitates the medical professionals' constant
attention, and even so time to time due to the time constrains and pressure
they fail to classify correctly that leads to wrong treatment. Numerous efforts
have been made to automate the entire glaucoma classification procedure
however, these existing models in general have a black box characteristics that
prevents users from understanding the key reasons behind the prediction and
thus medical practitioners generally can not rely on these system. In this
article after comparing with various pre-trained models, we propose a transfer
learning model that is able to classify Glaucoma with 94.71\% accuracy. In
addition, we have utilized Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanations(LIME) that introduces explainability in our system. This
improvement enables medical professionals obtain important and comprehensive
information that aid them in making judgments. It also lessen the opacity and
fragility of the traditional deep learning models.

classifying images, ensuring a great promise for analyzing medical imaging.
Translating the success of deep learning to medical imaging, in which doctors
need to understand the underlying process, requires the capability to interpret
and explain the prediction of neural networks. Interpretability of deep neural
networks often relies on estimating the importance of input features (e.g.,
pixels) with respect to the outcome (e.g., class probability). However, a
number of importance estimators (also known as saliency maps) have been
developed and it is unclear which ones are more relevant for medical imaging
applications. In the present work, we investigated the performance of several
importance estimators in explaining the classification of computed tomography
(CT) images by a convolutional deep network, using three distinct evaluation
metrics. First, the model-centric fidelity measures a decrease in the model
accuracy when certain inputs are perturbed. Second, concordance between
importance scores and the expert-defined segmentation masks is measured on a
pixel level by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Third, we
measure a region-wise overlap between a XRAI-based map and the segmentation
mask by Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC). Overall, two versions of SmoothGrad
topped the fidelity and ROC rankings, whereas both Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad excelled in DSC evaluation. Interestingly, there was a critical
discrepancy between model-centric (fidelity) and human-centric (ROC and DSC)
evaluation. Expert expectation and intuition embedded in segmentation maps does
not necessarily align with how the model arrived at its prediction.
Understanding this difference in interpretability would help harnessing the
power of deep learning in medicine.

##### **An Interactive Interpretability System for Breast Cancer Screening with Deep Learning**
2210.08979v1 by Yuzhe Lu, Adam Perer

Deep learning methods, in particular convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as a powerful tool in medical image computing tasks. While these
complex models provide excellent performance, their black-box nature may hinder
real-world adoption in high-stakes decision-making. In this paper, we propose
an interactive system to take advantage of state-of-the-art interpretability
techniques to assist radiologists with breast cancer screening. Our system
integrates a deep learning model into the radiologists' workflow and provides
novel interactions to promote understanding of the model's decision-making
process. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system can take advantage of user
interactions progressively to provide finer-grained explainability reports with
little labeling overhead. Due to the generic nature of the adopted
interpretability technique, our system is domain-agnostic and can be used for
many different medical image computing tasks, presenting a novel perspective on
how we can leverage visual analytics to transform originally static
interpretability techniques to augment human decision making and promote the
adoption of medical AI.

##### **Explainable AI for clinical and remote health applications: a survey on tabular and time series data**
2209.06528v1 by Flavio Di Martino, Franca Delmastro

Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of
healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI
systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions
and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive
and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same
attention across different research areas and data types, especially in
healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are
based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly
analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI
methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the
healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5
years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided
to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical
validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality
evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure
effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main
research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI
methods.

Objectives: The present study evaluated the impact of a commercially
available explainable AI algorithm in augmenting the ability of clinicians to
identify lung cancer on chest X-rays (CXR).
  Design: This retrospective study evaluated the performance of 11 clinicians
for detecting lung cancer from chest radiographs, with and without assistance
from a commercially available AI algorithm (red dot, Behold.ai) that predicts
suspected lung cancer from CXRs. Clinician performance was evaluated against
clinically confirmed diagnoses.
  Setting: The study analysed anonymised patient data from an NHS hospital; the
dataset consisted of 400 chest radiographs from adult patients (18 years and
above) who had a CXR performed in 2020, with corresponding clinical text
reports.
  Participants: A panel of readers consisting of 11 clinicians (consultant
radiologists, radiologist trainees and reporting radiographers) participated in
this study.
  Main outcome measures: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and
precision for detecting lung cancer on CXRs by clinicians, with and without AI
input. Agreement rates between clinicians and performance standard deviation
were also evaluated, with and without AI input.
  Results: The use of the AI algorithm by clinicians led to an improved overall
performance for lung tumour detection, achieving an overall increase of 17.4%
of lung cancers being identified on CXRs which would have otherwise been
missed, an overall increase in detection of smaller tumours, a 24% and 13%
increased detection of stage 1 and stage 2 lung cancers respectively, and
standardisation of clinician performance.
  Conclusions: This study showed great promise in the clinical utility of AI
algorithms in improving early lung cancer diagnosis and promoting health equity
through overall improvement in reader performances, without impacting
downstream imaging resources.

##### **GAN-based generative modelling for dermatological applications -- comparative study**
2208.11702v1 by Sandra Carrasco Limeros, Sylwia Majchrowska, Mohamad Khir Zoubi, Anna Rosén, Juulia Suvilehto, Lisa Sjöblom, Magnus Kjellberg

The lack of sufficiently large open medical databases is one of the biggest
challenges in AI-powered healthcare. Synthetic data created using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) appears to be a good solution to mitigate the
issues with privacy policies. The other type of cure is decentralized protocol
across multiple medical institutions without exchanging local data samples. In
this paper, we explored unconditional and conditional GANs in centralized and
decentralized settings. The centralized setting imitates studies on large but
highly unbalanced skin lesion dataset, while the decentralized one simulates a
more realistic hospital scenario with three institutions. We evaluated models'
performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, speed of training, and predictive
ability of classifiers trained on the generated synthetic data. In addition we
provided explainability through exploration of latent space and embeddings
projection focused both on global and local explanations. Calculated distance
between real images and their projections in the latent space proved the
authenticity and generalization of trained GANs, which is one of the main
concerns in this type of applications. The open source code for conducted
studies is publicly available at

##### **Planning and Scheduling in Digital Health with Answer Set Programming**
2208.03099v1 by Marco Mochi

In the hospital world there are several complex combinatory problems, and
solving these problems is important to increase the degree of patients'
satisfaction and the quality of care offered. The problems in the healthcare
are complex since to solve them several constraints and different type of
resources should be taken into account. Moreover, the solutions must be
evaluated in a small amount of time to ensure the usability in real scenarios.
We plan to propose solutions to these kind of problems both expanding already
tested solutions and by modelling solutions for new problems, taking into
account the literature and by using real data when available. Solving these
kind of problems is important but, since the European Commission established
with the General Data Protection Regulation that each person has the right to
ask for explanation of the decision taken by an AI, without developing
Explainability methodologies the usage of AI based solvers e.g. those based on
Answer Set programming will be limited. Thus, another part of the research will
be devoted to study and propose new methodologies for explaining the solutions
obtained.

##### **AI Approaches in Processing and Using Data in Personalized Medicine**
2208.04698v1 by Mirjana Ivanovic, Serge Autexier, Miltiadis Kokkonidis

In modern dynamic constantly developing society, more and more people suffer
from chronic and serious diseases and doctors and patients need special and
sophisticated medical and health support. Accordingly, prominent health
stakeholders have recognized the importance of development of such services to
make patients life easier. Such support requires the collection of huge amount
of patients complex data like clinical, environmental, nutritional, daily
activities, variety of data from smart wearable devices, data from clothing
equipped with sensors etc. Holistic patients data must be properly aggregated,
processed, analyzed, and presented to the doctors and caregivers to recommend
adequate treatment and actions to improve patients health related parameters
and general wellbeing. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques offer the
opportunity to analyze such big data, consume them, and derive new knowledge to
support personalized medical decisions. New approaches like those based on
advanced machine learning, federated learning, transfer learning, explainable
artificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of health and
medical data in future. In this paper, we will present some crucial aspects and
characteristic examples in the area of application of a range of artificial
intelligence approaches in personalized medical decisions.

##### **TRUST-LAPSE: An Explainable and Actionable Mistrust Scoring Framework for Model Monitoring**
2207.11290v2 by Nandita Bhaskhar, Daniel L. Rubin, Christopher Lee-Messer

Continuous monitoring of trained ML models to determine when their
predictions should and should not be trusted is essential for their safe
deployment. Such a framework ought to be high-performing, explainable, post-hoc
and actionable. We propose TRUST-LAPSE, a "mistrust" scoring framework for
continuous model monitoring. We assess the trustworthiness of each input
sample's model prediction using a sequence of latent-space embeddings.
Specifically, (a) our latent-space mistrust score estimates mistrust using
distance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity metrics (cosine
similarity) in the latent-space and (b) our sequential mistrust score
determines deviations in correlations over the sequence of past input
representations in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm for
actionable continuous monitoring. We evaluate TRUST-LAPSE via two downstream
tasks: (1) distributionally shifted input detection, and (2) data drift
detection. We evaluate across diverse domains - audio and vision using public
datasets and further benchmark our approach on challenging, real-world
electroencephalograms (EEG) datasets for seizure detection. Our latent-space
mistrust scores achieve state-of-the-art results with AUROCs of 84.1 (vision),
73.9 (audio), and 77.1 (clinical EEGs), outperforming baselines by over 10
points. We expose critical failures in popular baselines that remain
insensitive to input semantic content, rendering them unfit for real-world
model monitoring. We show that our sequential mistrust scores achieve high
drift detection rates; over 90% of the streams show < 20% error for all
domains. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show
that our mistrust scores are more robust and provide explainability for easy
adoption into practice.

##### **Revealing Unfair Models by Mining Interpretable Evidence**
2207.05811v1 by Mohit Bajaj, Lingyang Chu, Vittorio Romaniello, Gursimran Singh, Jian Pei, Zirui Zhou, Lanjun Wang, Yong Zhang

The popularity of machine learning has increased the risk of unfair models
getting deployed in high-stake applications, such as justice system,
drug/vaccination design, and medical diagnosis. Although there are effective
methods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and
explain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing
unfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical
step towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle
the novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence
(RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data
instances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable,
we also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules
that characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from
the other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on
many real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid
evidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it
is much more scalable than all of the baseline methods.

##### **From Correlation to Causation: Formalizing Interpretable Machine Learning as a Statistical Process**
2207.04969v1 by Lukas Klein, Mennatallah El-Assady, Paul F. Jäger

Explainable AI (XAI) is a necessity in safety-critical systems such as in
clinical diagnostics due to a high risk for fatal decisions. Currently,
however, XAI resembles a loose collection of methods rather than a well-defined
process. In this work, we elaborate on conceptual similarities between the
largest subgroup of XAI, interpretable machine learning (IML), and classical
statistics. Based on these similarities, we present a formalization of IML
along the lines of a statistical process. Adopting this statistical view allows
us to interpret machine learning models and IML methods as sophisticated
statistical tools. Based on this interpretation, we infer three key questions,
which we identify as crucial for the success and adoption of IML in
safety-critical settings. By formulating these questions, we further aim to
spark a discussion about what distinguishes IML from classical statistics and
what our perspective implies for the future of the field.

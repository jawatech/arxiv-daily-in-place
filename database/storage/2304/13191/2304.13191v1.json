These systems\nare built by clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) researchers for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). At present, the role\nof VMHAs is to provide emotional support through information, focusing less on\ndeveloping a reflective conversation with the patient. A more comprehensive,\nsafe and explainable approach is required to build responsible VMHAs to ask\nfollow-up questions or provide a well-informed response. This survey offers a\nsystematic critical review of the existing conversational agents in mental\nhealth, followed by new insights into the improvements of VMHAs with contextual\nknowledge, datasets, and their emerging role in clinical decision support. We\nalso provide new directions toward enriching the user experience of VMHAs with\nexplainability, safety, and wholesome trustworthiness. Finally, we provide\nevaluation metrics and practical considerations for VMHAs beyond the current\nliterature to build trust between VMHAs and patients in active communications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Surjodeep Sarkar et.al.", "authors": "Surjodeep Sarkar,Manas Gaur,L.

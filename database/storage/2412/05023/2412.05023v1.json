By utilizing a\nMixture of Experts (MoE) Model, along with analogical prompting, we are able to\nshow improved model performance when compared to the baseline on standard LLMs.\nWe also survey the limits of these prompting techniques and the effects they\nhave on model performance. Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a\nprompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage\nAnalogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a\nlack of specialist training data.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5c0f\u6a23\u672c\u548c\u9023\u7e8c\u601d\u8003\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u7269\u7406\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u7b54\u4efb\u52d9\u6642\u5df2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u65bc LLM \u5167\u5efa\u7684\u6578\u5b78\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73fe\u5e7b\u89ba\u3002\u900f\u904e\u5229\u7528\u5c08\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408 (MoE) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u985e\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u8207\u6a19\u6e96 LLM \u57fa\u6e96\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u8abf\u67e5\u4e86\u9019\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u985e\u6bd4 CoT \u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8b93\u8f03\u5c0f\u7684\u958b\u653e\u539f\u59cb\u78bc\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u904b\u7528\u985e\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9019\u9ede\u662f\u5b83\u5011\u4e00\u76f4\u96e3\u4ee5\u505a\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c08\u9580\u7684\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u3002", "author": "Krishnasai Addala et.al.", "authors": "Krishnasai Addala, Kabir Dev Paul Baghel, Chhavi Kirtani, Avinash Anand, Rajiv Ratn Shah", "id": "2412.05023v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05023v1", "repo": "null"}}

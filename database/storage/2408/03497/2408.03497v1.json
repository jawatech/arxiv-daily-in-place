In the past, screening applicants'applicants' conditions often\nrequired a significant amount of manual labor, which was time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive. Although the accuracy and reliability of previously used ML\nmodels have been continuously improving, the pursuit of more reliable and\npowerful AI intelligent models is undoubtedly the unremitting pursuit by major\nbanks in the financial industry. In this study, we used a dataset of over\n40,000 records provided by a commercial bank as the research object. We\ncompared various dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and T-SNE for\npreprocessing high-dimensional datasets and performed in-depth adaptation and\ntuning of distributed models such as LightGBM and XGBoost, as well as deep\nmodels like Tabnet. After a series of research and processing, we obtained\nexcellent research results by combining SMOTEENN with these techniques. The\nexperiments demonstrated that LightGBM combined with PCA and SMOTEENN\ntechniques can assist banks in accurately predicting potential high-quality\ncustomers, showing relatively outstanding performance compared to other models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u9280\u884c\u4fe1\u8cb8\u98a8\u96aa\u662f\u73fe\u4ee3\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u5728\u773e\u591a\u7533\u8acb\u4eba\u4e2d\u8b58\u5225\u51fa\u5408\u683c\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u5c0d\u65bc\u9280\u884c\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u696d\u52d9\u7372\u5229\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u7be9\u9078\u7533\u8acb\u4eba\u7684\u689d\u4ef6\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u52de\u52d5\uff0c\u9019\u65e2\u8017\u6642\u53c8\u8cbb\u529b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5148\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684 ML \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e96\u78ba\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6301\u7e8c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5f37\u5927\u7684 AI \u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7121\u7591\u662f\u91d1\u878d\u7522\u696d\u4e2d\u5404\u5927\u9280\u884c\u7684\u4e0d\u61c8\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u5bb6\u5546\u696d\u9280\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8d85\u904e 40,000 \u7b46\u8a18\u9304\u7684\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4f5c\u70ba\u7814\u7a76\u5c0d\u8c61\u3002\u6211\u5011\u6bd4\u8f03\u4e86 PCA \u548c T-SNE \u7b49\u5404\u7a2e\u964d\u7dad\u6280\u8853\u4ee5\u9810\u8655\u7406\u9ad8\u7dad\u5ea6\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d LightGBM \u548c XGBoost \u7b49\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca Tabnet \u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9032\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8abf\u6574\u548c\u5fae\u8abf\u3002\u7d93\u904e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8655\u7406\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7d50\u5408 SMOTEENN \u8207\u9019\u4e9b\u6280\u8853\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u512a\u7570\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u3002\u5be6\u9a57\u8b49\u660e\uff0cLightGBM \u7d50\u5408 PCA \u548c SMOTEENN \u6280\u8853\u53ef\u4ee5\u5354\u52a9\u9280\u884c\u6e96\u78ba\u9810\u6e2c\u6f5b\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u5ba2\u6236\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73fe\u76f8\u5c0d\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "author": "Chang Yu et.al.", "authors": "Chang Yu, Yixin Jin, Qianwen Xing, Ye Zhang, Shaobo Guo, Shuchen Meng", "id": "2408.03497v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03497v1", "repo": "null"}}

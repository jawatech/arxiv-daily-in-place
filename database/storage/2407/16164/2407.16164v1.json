However, it is still opaque in which\ncircumstances and conditions the model becomes privacy-vulnerable, leading to a\nchallenge for ML models to maintain both performance and privacy. In this\npaper, we first explore the disparity between member and non-member data in the\nrepresentation of models under common training frameworks. We identify how the\nrepresentation magnitude disparity correlates with privacy vulnerability and\naddress how this correlation impacts privacy vulnerability. Based on the\nobservations, we propose Saturn Ring Classifier Module (SRCM), a plug-in\nmodel-level solution to mitigate membership privacy leakage. Through a confined\nyet effective representation space, our approach ameliorates models' privacy\nvulnerability while maintaining generalizability.

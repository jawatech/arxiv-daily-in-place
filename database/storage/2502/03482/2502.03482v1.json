A Case Study on AI-Assisted Prostate Cancer MRI Diagnosis", "paper_summary": "Despite the growing interest in human-AI decision making, experimental\nstudies with domain experts remain rare, largely due to the complexity of\nworking with domain experts and the challenges in setting up realistic\nexperiments. In this work, we conduct an in-depth collaboration with\nradiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI images. Building on\nexisting tools for teaching prostate cancer diagnosis, we develop an interface\nand conduct two experiments to study how AI assistance and performance feedback\nshape the decision making of domain experts. In Study 1, clinicians were asked\nto provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and\nsubsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a\nmemory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated\nperformance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the\nAI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed\nthe AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial\ndiagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools\nmight be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where\ndoctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance\nfeedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform\nhumans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to\nprior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback\ndid not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although\nshowing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we\nobserve that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting\npromising directions for human-AI collaboration.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u4eba\u5011\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u8207 AI \u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u611f\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u4f46\u8207\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u5c11\u898b\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u8207\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u8907\u96dc\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5be6\u969b\u5be6\u9a57\u6642\u9762\u81e8\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5728\u9019\u9805\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u8207\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u91ab\u5e2b\u9032\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u65bc MRI \u5f71\u50cf\u8a3a\u65b7\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u7528\u65bc\u6559\u6388\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u8a3a\u65b7\u7684\u73fe\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u4ecb\u9762\u4e26\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u5169\u9805\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76 AI \u5354\u52a9\u548c\u6548\u80fd\u56de\u994b\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u9818\u57df\u5c08\u5bb6\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002\u5728\u7814\u7a76 1 \u4e2d\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u5e2b\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u6b65\u8a3a\u65b7\uff08\u4eba\u985e\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u6aa2\u8996 AI \u7684\u9810\u6e2c\uff0c\u4e26\u96a8\u5f8c\u78ba\u5b9a\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\uff08\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5718\u968a\uff09\u3002\u5728\u7814\u7a76 2\uff08\u7d93\u904e\u4e00\u6bb5\u8a18\u61b6\u6e05\u9664\u671f\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c3\u8207\u8005\u9996\u5148\u6536\u5230\u7814\u7a76 1 \u7684\u5f59\u7e3d\u6548\u80fd\u7d71\u8a08\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u4ed6\u5011\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3001AI \u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5718\u968a\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5728\u505a\u51fa\u8a3a\u65b7\u524d\u76f4\u63a5\u6aa2\u8996 AI \u7684\u9810\u6e2c\uff08\u5373\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u7368\u7acb\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8a3a\u65b7\uff09\u3002\u9019\u5169\u500b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u81e8\u5e8a AI \u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u500b\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u64ec\u4e86\u91ab\u751f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u64da\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u56de\u994b\u8abf\u6574\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d AI \u7684\u4f9d\u8cf4\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u986f\u793a\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5718\u968a\u59cb\u7d42\u512a\u65bc\u55ae\u7368\u7684\u4eba\u985e\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u4f9d\u8cf4\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u5982 AI\uff0c\u9019\u8207\u4e4b\u524d\u91dd\u5c0d\u7fa4\u773e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u985e\u4f3c\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u4e8b\u5148\u986f\u793a AI \u6c7a\u7b56\u6703\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4eba\u5011\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u9075\u5faa AI\uff0c\u4f46\u5411\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u5e2b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6548\u80fd\u56de\u994b\u4e26\u672a\u986f\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5718\u968a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u89c0\u5bdf\u5230\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5718\u968a\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u512a\u65bc\u55ae\u7368\u7684 AI\uff0c\u9019\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u985e-AI \u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002", "author": "Chacha Chen et.al.", "authors": "Chacha Chen, Han Liu, Jiamin Yang, Benjamin M.

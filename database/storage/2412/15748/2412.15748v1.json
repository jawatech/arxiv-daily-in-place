We emphasise the importance of understanding\nreasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is\nequivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving\nXAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact\nacross the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of\nreasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise\nand discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning\nbehaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can\nempower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight\ninto the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models.\nConclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine\nlearning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the\nintegration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the\nhealthcare system as a whole", "paper_summary_zh": "\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u5118\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u76ee\u524d\u5728\u91ab\u7642\u9818\u57df\u7121\u6240\u4e0d\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8a1d\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u63a2\u8a0e\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u537b\u76f8\u7576\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u70ba\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u5c64\u7d1a\u7684\u9810\u6e2c\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5728\u9019\u7a2e\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u9019\u7b49\u540c\u65bc\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb AI (XAI)\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u81e8\u5e8a\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u91ab\u7642 LLM \u4e2d\u5be6\u73fe XAI\uff0c\u5c07\u5c0d\u6574\u500b\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u7522\u696d\u7522\u751f\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5728\u91ab\u7642 LLM \u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u63a5\u8457\u6211\u5011\u5206\u985e\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u7576\u524d\u8a55\u4f30\u91ab\u7642 LLM \u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u70ba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8ad6\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u8b93\u91ab\u7642\u5c08\u696d\u4eba\u54e1\u6216\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\u5f97\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u9019\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u5c64\u7d1a\u63a8\u7406\u904b\u7b97\u3002\u7d50\u8ad6\uff1a\u81e8\u5e8a\u91ab\u751f\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u5c0d\u91ab\u7642\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u96a8\u4e4b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c07\u52a0\u901f\u91ab\u7642 AI \u5728\u6574\u500b\u91ab\u7642\u4fdd\u5065\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3001\u61c9\u7528\u548c\u9032\u4e00\u6b65\u767c\u5c55\u3002", "author": "Shamus Sim et.al.", "authors": "Shamus Sim, Tyrone Chen", "id": "2412.15748v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15748v1", "repo": "null"}}

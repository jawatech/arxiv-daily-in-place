Thus, it is essential to gain a better\nunderstanding of their capabilities and limitations, among others in terms of\nnonmonotonic reasoning. This paper proposes a benchmark that corresponds to\nvarious defeasible rule-based reasoning patterns. We modified an existing\nbenchmark for defeasible logic reasoners by translating defeasible rules into\ntext suitable for LLMs. We conducted preliminary experiments on nonmonotonic\nrule-based reasoning using ChatGPT and compared it with reasoning patterns\ndefined by defeasible logic.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LLM) \u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u9818\u57df\u4e2d\u7372\u5f97\u986f\u8457\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u5177\u6709\u5091\u51fa\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5c0d\u5b83\u5011\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9650\u5236\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u55ae\u8abf\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c0d\u61c9\u65bc\u5404\u7a2e\u53ef\u63a8\u7ffb\u898f\u5247\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u6e96\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u73fe\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u7ffb\u908f\u8f2f\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u6e96\uff0c\u5c07\u53ef\u63a8\u7ffb\u898f\u5247\u8f49\u63db\u70ba\u9069\u5408 LLM \u7684\u6587\u5b57\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c0d\u4f7f\u7528 ChatGPT \u7684\u975e\u55ae\u8abf\u898f\u5247\u63a8\u7406\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u5be6\u9a57\uff0c\u4e26\u5c07\u5176\u8207\u53ef\u63a8\u7ffb\u908f\u8f2f\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002", "author": "Ilias Tachmazidis et.al.", "authors": "Ilias Tachmazidis, Sotiris Batsakis, Grigoris Antoniou", "id": "2410.12509v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12509v1", "repo": "null"}}

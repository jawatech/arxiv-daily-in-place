It is also crucial in\ntasks such as loop closure detection and global localization within SLAM.\nPrevious methods utilize mundane point cloud representations as input and deep\nlearning-based LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) approaches employing\ndifferent point cloud image inputs with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or\ntransformer architectures. However, the recently proposed Mamba deep learning\nmodel, combined with state space models (SSMs), holds great potential for long\nsequence modeling. Therefore, we developed OverlapMamba, a novel network for\nplace recognition, which represents input range views (RVs) as sequences. In a\nnovel way, we employ a stochastic reconstruction approach to build shift state\nspace models, compressing the visual representation. Evaluated on three\ndifferent public datasets, our method effectively detects loop closures,\nshowing robustness even when traversing previously visited locations from\ndifferent directions. Relying on raw range view inputs, it outperforms typical\nLiDAR and multi-view combination methods in time complexity and speed,\nindicating strong place recognition capabilities and real-time efficiency.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5834\u666f\u8fa8\u8b58\u662f\u8b93\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7d71\u80fd\u7368\u7acb\u6c7a\u7b56\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u904b\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u3002\u5b83\u5728 SLAM \u4e2d\u7684\u8ff4\u8def\u9589\u5408\u5075\u6e2c\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u4efb\u52d9\u4e2d\u4e5f\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6703\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u9ede\u96f2\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u70ba\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a1\u7528\u5377\u7a4d\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def (CNN) \u6216Transformer\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ede\u96f2\u5f71\u50cf\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5f0f\u96f7\u5c04\u96f7\u9054\u5834\u666f\u8fa8\u8b58 (LPR) \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 Mamba \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u578b\u7d50\u5408\u72c0\u614b\u7a7a\u9593\u6a21\u578b (SSM)\uff0c\u5728\u9577\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u64c1\u6709\u6975\u4f73\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u958b\u767c\u4e86 OverlapMamba\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7528\u65bc\u5834\u666f\u8fa8\u8b58\u7684\u65b0\u7a4e\u7db2\u8def\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u8f38\u5165\u7bc4\u570d\u8996\u5716 (RV) \u8868\u793a\u70ba\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6211\u5011\u63a1\u7528\u4e00\u7a2e\u96a8\u6a5f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u8f49\u79fb\u72c0\u614b\u7a7a\u9593\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u58d3\u7e2e\u8996\u89ba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7a4e\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u500b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u516c\u958b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5075\u6e2c\u5230\u8ff4\u8def\u9589\u5408\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7a7f\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u9020\u8a2a\u904e\u7684\u5730\u9ede\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u4f9d\u8cf4\u672a\u8655\u7406\u7684\u7bc4\u570d\u8996\u5716\u8f38\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u6642\u9593\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u512a\u65bc\u5178\u578b\u7684 LiDAR \u548c\u591a\u8996\u5716\u7d44\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u986f\u793a\u51fa\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u5834\u666f\u8fa8\u8b58\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5373\u6642\u6548\u7387\u3002", "author": "Qiuchi Xiang et.al.", "authors": "Qiuchi Xiang, Jintao Cheng, Jiehao Luo, Jin Wu, Rui Fan, Xieyuanli Chen, Xiaoyu Tang", "id": "2405.07966v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07966v1", "repo": "https://github.com/scnu-rislab/overlapmamba"}}

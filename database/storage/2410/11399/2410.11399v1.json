This tradition\nis compared with three competing ones: (1) explanationism, which holds that\ntheory choice should be guided by a theory's overall balance of explanatory\nvirtues, such as simplicity and fit with data; (2) instrumentalism, according\nto which scientific inference should be driven by the goal of obtaining useful\nmodels, rather than true theories; (3) Bayesianism, which features a shift of\nfocus from all-or-nothing beliefs to degrees of belief.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u9867\u4e26\u767c\u5c55\u4e86\u79d1\u5b78\u54f2\u5b78\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a8d\u8b58\u8ad6\u50b3\u7d71\uff0c\u7a31\u70ba\u6536\u6582\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u5b83\u8a8d\u70ba\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u61c9\u6839\u64da\u5176\u6536\u6582\u65bc\u771f\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9032\u884c\u8a55\u4f30\u3002\u9019\u7a2e\u50b3\u7d71\u8207\u4e09\u7a2e\u7af6\u722d\u50b3\u7d71\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a(1) \u89e3\u91cb\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u5b83\u8a8d\u70ba\u7406\u8ad6\u9078\u64c7\u61c9\u7531\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u7f8e\u5fb7\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u5e73\u8861\u4f86\u6307\u5c0e\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7c21\u6f54\u6027\u548c\u8207\u6578\u64da\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\uff1b(2) \u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u6839\u64da\u5b83\uff0c\u79d1\u5b78\u63a8\u7406\u61c9\u7531\u7372\u5f97\u6709\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u5be6\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u9a45\u52d5\uff1b(3) \u8c9d\u8449\u65af\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u5b83\u5c07\u7126\u9ede\u5f9e\u975e\u6b64\u5373\u5f7c\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8f49\u79fb\u5230\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "author": "Hanti Lin et.al.", "authors": "Hanti Lin", "id": "2410.11399v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11399v1", "repo": "null"}}

{"2410.07866": {"publish_time": "2024-10-10", "title": "System-2 Reasoning via Generality and Adaptation", "paper_summary": "While significant progress has been made in task-specific applications,\ncurrent models struggle with deep reasoning, generality, and adaptation -- key\ncomponents of System-2 reasoning that are crucial for achieving Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI). Despite the promise of approaches such as program\nsynthesis, language models, and transformers, these methods often fail to\ngeneralize beyond their training data and to adapt to novel tasks, limiting\ntheir ability to perform human-like reasoning. This paper explores the\nlimitations of existing approaches in achieving advanced System-2 reasoning and\nhighlights the importance of generality and adaptation for AGI. Moreover, we\npropose four key research directions to address these gaps: (1) learning human\nintentions from action sequences, (2) combining symbolic and neural models, (3)\nmeta-learning for unfamiliar environments, and (4) reinforcement learning to\nreason multi-step. Through these directions, we aim to advance the ability to\ngeneralize and adapt, bringing computational models closer to the reasoning\ncapabilities required for AGI.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u5118\u7ba1\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52d9\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u9032\u5c55\uff0c\n\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96e3\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e9b\u662f\u7cfb\u7d71 2 \u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u7d44\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5be6\u73fe\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u6167 (AGI) \u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u6709\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f49\u63db\u5668\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7121\u6cd5\u63a8\u5ee3\u5230\u8a13\u7df4\u8cc7\u6599\u4e4b\u5916\u4e26\u9069\u61c9\u65b0\u4efb\u52d9\uff0c\u9019\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5011\u57f7\u884c\u985e\u4eba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e86\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5be6\u73fe\u9032\u968e\u7cfb\u7d71 2 \u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e26\u5f37\u8abf\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u6027\u5c0d AGI \u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a(1) \u5f9e\u52d5\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u4eba\u985e\u610f\u5716\uff0c(2) \u7d50\u5408\u7b26\u865f\u548c\u795e\u7d93\u6a21\u578b\uff0c(3) \u91dd\u5c0d\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u9032\u884c\u5143\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca (4) \u900f\u904e\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\u9032\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u9a5f\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u900f\u904e\u9019\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u5ee3\u548c\u9069\u61c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8b93\u8a08\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1 AGI \u6240\u9700\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "author": "Sejin Kim et.al.", "authors": "Sejin Kim, Sundong Kim", "id": "2410.07866v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07866v1", "repo": "null"}}

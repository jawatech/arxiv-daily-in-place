Despite the dominance of multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning approaches in financial markets with observable data, there exists a\nset of systematically significant financial markets that pose challenges due to\ntheir partial or obscured data availability. We, therefore, devise a\nmulti-agent simulation approach employing small-scale meta-heuristic methods.\nThis approach aims to represent the opaque bilateral market for Australian\ngovernment bond trading, capturing the bilateral nature of bank-to-bank\ntrading, also referred to as \"over-the-counter\" (OTC) trading, and commonly\noccurring between \"market makers\". The uniqueness of the bilateral market,\ncharacterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields\nvaluable insights for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The\ninherent rigidity of this market structure, which is at odds with the global\nproliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance,\nunderscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore\nthe implications of market rigidity on market structure and consider the\nelement of stability, in market design. This extends the ongoing discourse on\ncomplex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of\ntheir dynamics and implications.", "paper_summary_zh": "", "author": "Alicia Vidler et.al.", "authors": "Alicia Vidler,Toby Walsh", "id": "2405.02849v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02849v1", "repo": "null"}}

With the rise of artificial intelligence in education, there is a\ngrowing interest in developing intelligent systems that can automatically\ngenerate and answer questions and facilitate interactions in both virtual and\nin-person education settings. However, to develop effective AI models for\neducation, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of questioning.\nIn this study, we created the YouTube Learners' Questions on Bloom's Taxonomy\nDataset (YouLeQD), which contains learner-posed questions from YouTube lecture\nvideo comments. Along with the dataset, we developed two RoBERTa-based\nclassification models leveraging Large Language Models to detect questions and\nanalyze their cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy. This dataset and our\nfindings provide valuable insights into the cognitive complexity of\nlearner-posed questions in educational videos and their relationship with\ninteraction metrics. This can aid in the development of more effective AI\nmodels for education and improve the overall learning experience for students.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u63d0\u554f\u662f\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u5411\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u8a55\u91cf\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u529b\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u4e26\u9f13\u52f5\u7a4d\u6975\u53c3\u8207\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u6167\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\uff0c\u958b\u767c\u667a\u6167\u7cfb\u7d71\u4ee5\u81ea\u52d5\u7522\u751f\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4e26\u4fc3\u9032\u865b\u64ec\u548c\u9762\u5c0d\u9762\u6559\u80b2\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\uff0c\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u8996\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8981\u958b\u767c\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6559\u80b2 AI \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u63d0\u554f\u6709\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u81f3\u95dc\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86 YouTube \u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u5728 Bloom \u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u554f\u984c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6 (YouLeQD)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u5728 YouTube \u8ab2\u7a0b\u5f71\u7247\u7559\u8a00\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u9084\u958b\u767c\u4e86\u5169\u500b\u57fa\u65bc RoBERTa \u7684\u5206\u985e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u5075\u6e2c\u554f\u984c\u4e26\u4f7f\u7528 Bloom \u5206\u985e\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8a8d\u77e5\u8907\u96dc\u6027\u3002\u9019\u500b\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u548c\u6211\u5011\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u898b\u89e3\uff0c\u8aaa\u660e\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5f71\u7247\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u554f\u984c\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\u8907\u96dc\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5011\u8207\u4e92\u52d5\u6307\u6a19\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u9019\u6709\u52a9\u65bc\u958b\u767c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6559\u80b2 AI \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e26\u6539\u5584\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6574\u9ad4\u5b78\u7fd2\u9ad4\u9a57\u3002", "author": "Nong Ming et.al.", "authors": "Nong Ming, Sachin Sharma, Jiho Noh", "id": "2501.11712v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11712v1", "repo": "https://github.com/jiho-yesnlp/qytl"}}

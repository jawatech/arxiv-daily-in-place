With their distinct nature, it is hard for survival models to\nsimultaneously optimize both of them especially as many previous results found\nimproving calibration tends to diminish discrimination performance. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach utilizing conformal regression that can improve a\nmodel's calibration without degrading discrimination. We provide theoretical\nguarantees for the above claim, and rigorously validate the efficiency of our\napproach across 11 real-world datasets, showcasing its practical applicability\nand robustness in diverse scenarios.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u8fa8\u5225\u548c\u6821\u6e96\u4ee3\u8868\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5169\u500b\u91cd\u8981\u5c6c\u6027\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u8a55\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6e96\u78ba\u6392\u5217\u53d7\u8a66\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5f8c\u8005\u8a55\u4f30\u9810\u6e2c\u7d50\u679c\u8207\u5be6\u969b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u96e3\u540c\u6642\u512a\u5316\u5b83\u5011\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u8a31\u591a\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u767c\u73fe\u6539\u5584\u6821\u6e96\u5f80\u5f80\u6703\u964d\u4f4e\u8fa8\u5225\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7d39\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u5229\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u56de\u6b78\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u8fa8\u5225\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u6e96\u3002\u6211\u5011\u70ba\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8aaa\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8ad6\u4fdd\u8b49\uff0c\u4e26\u56b4\u683c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 11 \u500b\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5be6\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7a69\u5065\u6027\u3002", "author": "Shi-ang Qi et.al.", "authors": "Shi-ang Qi, Yakun Yu, Russell Greiner", "id": "2405.07374v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07374v1", "repo": "https://github.com/shi-ang/csd"}}

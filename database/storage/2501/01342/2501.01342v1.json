{"2501.01342": {"publish_time": "2025-01-02", "title": "DeepFilter: An Instrumental Baseline for Accurate and Efficient Process Monitoring", "paper_summary": "Effective process monitoring is increasingly vital in industrial automation\nfor ensuring operational safety, necessitating both high accuracy and\nefficiency. Although Transformers have demonstrated success in various fields,\ntheir canonical form based on the self-attention mechanism is inadequate for\nprocess monitoring due to two primary limitations: (1) the step-wise\ncorrelations captured by self-attention mechanism are difficult to capture\ndiscriminative patterns in monitoring logs due to the lacking semantics of each\nstep, thus compromising accuracy; (2) the quadratic computational complexity of\nself-attention hampers efficiency. To address these issues, we propose\nDeepFilter, a Transformer-style framework for process monitoring. The core\ninnovation is an efficient filtering layer that excel capturing long-term and\nperiodic patterns with reduced complexity. Equipping with the global filtering\nlayer, DeepFilter enhances both accuracy and efficiency, meeting the stringent\ndemands of process monitoring. Experimental results on real-world process\nmonitoring datasets validate DeepFilter's superiority in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art models.", "paper_summary_zh": "\u6709\u6548\u88fd\u7a0b\u76e3\u63a7\u5728\u5de5\u696d\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u78ba\u4fdd\u4f5c\u696d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5118\u7ba1 Transformer \u5df2\u5728\u5404\u9818\u57df\u8b49\u660e\u5176\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57fa\u65bc\u81ea\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u6a5f\u5236\u7684\u6a19\u6e96\u5f62\u5f0f\u7531\u65bc\u5169\u500b\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u800c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9032\u884c\u88fd\u7a0b\u76e3\u63a7\uff1a(1) \u81ea\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u6a5f\u5236\u6240\u64f7\u53d6\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u95dc\u806f\u6027\u96e3\u4ee5\u64f7\u53d6\u76e3\u63a7\u8a18\u9304\u4e2d\u7684\u5340\u5206\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u6bcf\u500b\u6b65\u9a5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8a9e\u610f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\uff1b(2) \u81ea\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u904b\u7b97\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u6703\u963b\u7919\u6548\u7387\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u89e3\u6c7a\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 DeepFilter\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7528\u65bc\u88fd\u7a0b\u76e3\u63a7\u7684 Transformer \u98a8\u683c\u67b6\u69cb\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5275\u65b0\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u904e\u6ffe\u5c64\uff0c\u5176\u512a\u9ede\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e26\u64f7\u53d6\u9577\u671f\u548c\u9031\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u900f\u904e\u914d\u5099\u5168\u7403\u904e\u6ffe\u5c64\uff0cDeepFilter \u53ef\u540c\u6642\u63d0\u5347\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u6eff\u8db3\u88fd\u7a0b\u76e3\u63a7\u7684\u56b4\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5be6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u88fd\u7a0b\u76e3\u63a7\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u7d50\u679c\u9a57\u8b49\u4e86 DeepFilter \u5728\u6e96\u78ba\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u512a\u65bc\u73fe\u6709\u6700\u5148\u9032\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u512a\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "author": "Hao Wang et.al.", "authors": "Hao Wang, Zhichao Chen, Licheng Pan, Xiaoyu Jiang, Yichen Song, Qunshan He, Xinggao Liu", "id": "2501.01342v1", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01342v1", "repo": "null"}}
